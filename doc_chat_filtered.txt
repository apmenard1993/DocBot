when I pulled up to my house today, I stopped right as my song finished
it was so satisfying
8 hours of driving then perfectly timed ending
lol
well hell man, what do
my parents are getting taco bell, then i am eating taco bell, and after that i can do stuff if you can do stuff
lol that's if you want to do
you can also decompress
unpacking is 10x harder than packing
lol i sit
i am procrastinating unpacking
kek
GG
do you fits?
fits?
my phone sat idle in my pocket all day - dead. my tablet was playing music all day - 66% battery left
lol
you said "lol i sit"
oh har

it is
but yes after I eat shall we hang out for a bit?
just had the scariest damn bug
lightswitch controls the power to the outlet my pc is plugged into
accidentally hit it
lmao
turned it back on, error recovery screen freezes after hitting enter
like
consistently freezes
lolol
lol sure
Mai's over
so she'll be present
how's the new room andrew?
finally just let the timer go for the error recovery screen rather than hitting enter, and it worked
I also did promise that there would be some crime though.
lol
other than the lightswitch problem it is nice
no crime
crime is badong
you must be gnodab
Payday2 crime
Babyface Gremlin and Mad Mike are counting on me.

Stickyfingers Tony

i wish my GPU came with a free game instead of watchdogs
but nobody plays with meee :(
lol
I'd play with you
it comes with watchdogs?
you just have to let me know when you're down for crime.
watchdogs doesnt even look good to me
lol
it looks interesting at least
or better yet, just drop the price by $60 and dont give me a game
food's here
brb

andrew

decosine
art thou playing wt?
I was just a moment ago
do you wish to be playing?
i just hopped on, just unlocked the bt7 :P
I will join you then
Ian
Thomas Moore
andrew

your mom told me to tell you that they were going to sleep lol
Ian
Thomas Moore
neat
i'm probably not ever gonna play tanks
"World of tanks is getting boring. Lets do planes."
then we loop
lol
so i found something out about this new screen thingy
screenshotting doesn't see the game
I took liek 5 game screenshots because it has SO MANY MEME REFERENCES
all of them were of the desktop >_<
sooo yeah
it screenshots whatever window has focus
yeah that means your screen is probably set up a bit derpily
if you used some dual screen program to set it up that may be the problem, my screens had a program but it was a waste of space that tried to install AoL or something dumb
lol i didn't use a program
just had to reorganize some stuff
fixed it?
naw
not fixed
just not worrying about it
fleeing
what's everyone up to?
not much you?
kinda bored
watching tanks on youtube
ah
exciting
and looking through mod packs for skyrim in case i want to start playing sometime
yeah
want to wt?
WAR THUNDARRR
i shall wt in like.. 10 minutes
hmmm
I'll be on in 15ish
i am on ze var thundar
I'll be on in 10ish
Actually, I'm afraid I can't come on tonight.
We'll have to pick up tomorrow

Ian

What's up Docs?
just woke up from one of those damn panic attack dreams >.< lol
um
._.
brutal
in dream: time is 9:48 PM today, and irl, i'm supposed to be at work at 7
upon realization, total freak out and jolt out of bed lol
lol wow
these are regular occurrences as well, so im not surprised
o_O
night terror?
just the late to work panic dreams
i really hate being late to work
I have those if I have to travel.
Are you ever late?
i'm the person that everyone looks at funny if i'm a minute late
heh >_<
I haven't had an actual nightmare in ages.
extremely punctual
Lots of annoyances though
like I'm at a faire and I forgot my sword or soemthing
or forgot to stripe up
xD
or my clothes
lol
Been having a few vivid dreams but nothing like that for a while
i also had a kickass dream about being a james bond-esqe spy tonight
10/10 would have again
I don't lucid dream
my dreams are on rails
xD
I've had one lucid one I can remember... Me: o crap I'm dreaming!!!...
Woke up the second I thought that
DUDE
there was a time when I realized I was dreaming
and it sucked
it's usually weird
I was nailing a piece of bread to the wall because it made sense
then there were like these swiss models in my kitchen who were super amorous
So I looked over and contemplated
Realized, "I'm dreaming, I can do anything I want!"
THen the piece of bread was like, "...dude."
So I apologized and went back to hammering it into the wall.
then I woke up.
hahaha because dream logic :P
I RAGED
SO HARD
My only consolation was that I was at least nailing SOMETHING....
T_T
I prefer Swiss models to bread though.
Apparently they can induce lucid dreams with a low electrical current to the brain
xD
...hmm
lol my exact though
but no, i'm not electrocuting myself
yyeeeaaah
very interesting :P
lol, nailing bread
haha... I wish I could illustrate that scene
i had a dream i was driving and a guy was driving on the wrong side of the road, so i swerved around him but got pulled over for swerving
i was wearing a shirt, boxers, and a sheet
wrapped up like a mummy
i also had Heelys (the shoes) but they were the new wheeless version
and were super fast
wtf
super fast wheelless wheelies
hahaha
awww I was hoping you made a cartoon of you nailing bread to a wall with scantily clothed norwegian girls in the background
lol no
not on the list but I should make it so
found another dual-monitor issue
my tablet width spans both monitors
so a perfect circle for me is actually a long oval
are they two of the same monitor?
also alex brandon and I seem to constantly have dreams about each other
like I had a dream like a week ago that brandon lost his blue pair of shoes, and lost his job because they contained some kind of code (like machine/comp code, not like davinci) and he had a pair of red shoes and was hoping he could write code for them so he could get his job back
it was weird
hmm, I like to decipher my dreams when possible, sometimes it's just weird symbolism
often i find my dreams weird enough that I avoid telling people
lol
xD
what have you been up to lately ment?
Usually fragments relate to things you've seen or done up to a few days ago
Working here and there, no long contracts yet
teaching?
Market is terrible, yeah
i know what you mean lol my mom has been a teacher for almost 30 years :P
So i'm looking at different courses I culd take to expand my possiblities
could always go for your phD
hmm, I thought about it.
But at this point i'm so tired, that'll be a whole 2 more years of hard work
opens up possibilities like research and stuff
lol
yeah
college is derp
oh yeah they're the same monitors
that's very weird
yyyeeeaaaah
i'm updating the drivers and all that
found out there's supposed to be a tab that allows me to limit drawspace to one monitor
try your graphics card drivers too
haven't found it
just in case
orly
yeeeeeeeaaahhh
gotta restart now
ok
let's figure this out
got it
driver update ftw
now i can draw shit
or
i can play vidyagames
the struggle is real
hi
lol
hi
i installed skype on my work laptop :D
nice
what'
er
whatcha working on?
nothing yet
first day right?
yeah
seem cool?
yup
nice
apparently the amp limit is 15A for the rooms, but it's like 40 for the living room/kitchen
that's why we have breaker outages
your old room was going out from just having the fan and vacuume running though
yeah, i told him that, he said if we're still having problems (we tried the vacuum again and it was fine this time) then we'll have them come replace the breaker for that room
otherwise we can complain to the office and have them (hopefully) upgrade the amp limiter
lol
afk for a bit
i forgot he started his thing
indeed
indeed
orientation?
pretty much
neat
kinda sitting here with nothing to do
lol
woo money
my case, ssd, cpu, and RAM is in transit :D
woo
I GOT A B- IN CALC 3 WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I passed bitches!
lol
seriously though
that class
so
fucking
hard
class average was a 53%
i got a 56%
grades?!?!
lol wow average
well done sir
thanks :D
yeah the final exam average was a 37%
i got a 46%
that class made me feel absolutely fucking horrible
like
how would it feel to constantly fail things all the way through the class
and then all the sudden end up with a b
that's how i felt with PREcalc
still no grades from prepress
COME ON
:F
our grades were literally due today
two of my teachers decided to wait to post them til then
i got my math grade at like 4:30
I'm assuming I'm just getting the grade I have currently
89.9
fucker
I'd like to see my client presentation grade though :<
so lame when that happens
i had an 89.9 in my data structures class until the final, i needed a high A to get into A territory for my final grade, and somehow i pulled a 134/137 FTW
NICE
DICE
andrew
did you want to do crime?
payday 2?

adios
ok
adios

thun
der?
ner
yer
hi
how was werk
it was werk
I don't have an actual coding project yet
what did you do?
Set up laptop, talked to people about the comany, twiddled my thumbs
lol
My supervisor was out of town today
Played foosball
got wrecked
Looked at some Ruby code someone else was working on (he was in charge of showing me around for the day)
he explained a bug he was having in his project and kinda showed me the process he goes through to track/fix it
I made a suggestion regarding the nature of the bug, and my suggestion was correct :D
lol niiiice
...do you think that was a test?
nah
lol
He was working on an online real money based tournament web app
well that's awesome
the bug was, when tournament events happened (i.e. someone joined or clicked ready), too many notification messages were sent out
he got 6 messages, should have gotten 1
But it wasn't 6 individual messages, it was 6 links in the many-to-many mapping all pointing to the same message 6 times
which was my suggestion
snazzy
I wish I had actual code to work on though
So far, I am just the new guy who is terrible at foosball and asks random questions to kill time
lol
who solved a bug
I only solved the nature of the bug
ur mum
I am also terrible with names
I met like 10ish people today and I only know two of their names
one of which I already knew via email
lol
what does borked mean?
Ian called it a technical term
it is a technical term
tis
like
if something borked
like "He borked his motherboard"
"The table's borked."
seriously guy
this teacher
just emailed me the same email 4 times
in the last 2 minutes
you have a kanet i see
god I hope not
it's this online women's studies class
wat
um
ok
for a diversity credit
lol
poor you
I feel bad
what is a diversity credit?
You should have taken like Japanese traditional culture or something
You know
A real class
I took the easiest diversity class I could find
women's studies was the easiest?
yes
Well, its not a real subject soo.......
you just bullshit stuff about feminism
A+
I'm hoping that...
?
it's a male teacher
It is
just to surprise everyone
OH BEAST
booyah
lol
ok so you may actually learn something instead of propaganda
The teacher knows people take this class solely for a diversity credit
dafuq
and have no desire to learn the subject
well that's not right :<
especially during summer
This is one of the "go-to" classes for diversity credits
thats why there were like 12 different sessions for this class
i wonder what it says in the course catalogue descriptions
dafuq
theres a major in women's studies
lol
Interdisciplinary analysis of women in culture and society from historical and cross-cultural perspectives. (Diversity course.)
what is diversity credit?
just a requirement
like you have social science, math, science, etc requirements
why is it called diversity?
fine arts and diversity are requirements for all students, even if they are irrelvant to your major >_<
uhhh
we call it interdisciplinary requirement F12
diversity is like... studying other cultures or people
I call it retardation
oh
its called diversity because it is something that applies to some diversification of humans or cultures
oh
like women vs men or different racial histories, or even cultural things like dance
why not just do interdisciplinary? most people would end up doing "diversity" anywyas
seems like it just makes people resentful
its just pointless waste of money
$735ish for this class
it is an online class - it should be chaper dangit!
I have women studies this semester
my internship class costs over $800, and it basically doesnt even have a teacher
ouch!
such waste of money
oooh my gooooood
wow
Why should you have to take that
Garbage
rubbish
rage
grrrr
I dont have to take this internship class, but it's an easy 3 tech elective credits
and I'll be interning anyways
I'd just end up spending the $800 on another class to fill that requirement anyways I guess
I mean all "Diversity" credits are a waste
lol
I think anything not relating to your major is a waste >_>
Yup
core humanities, fine arts, diversity
Cutting all of those out, I'd have been able to graduate in 3 years lol
lol
sup all
hi
war thunder?
i dont have my mouse/keyboard/speakers set up
ah lame
wat do then
i can war thundar
or payday
or something
any2?
someone said wer tundear
i did
Ian
was paydayin
Ian
doktorz
Doctor
wassap
been tring to get virtualbox working on my work laptop for hours >_<
what is virtualbox?
used for virtual machines
why not vmware?
because it doesn't do what I need
what are you trying to do with it?
set up a Vagrant VM for working on this project
vagrant?
its a thing
lol
yes, that is vagrant
figured the site does a good enough explanation
lol
seems cool
something originate uses?
It's a pain in the ass
Something this company uses
ah
they have their own developers
gotcha
we're working with them
what's so PITA about it?
it doesn't work
lol
virtualbox won't let me create a host only network adapter
ah
that sounds like a problem
I've tried every solution on google
...
this problem was a huge issues on mac for a while, but has since been fixed... but now googling this error shows 90% mac stuff that doesnt apply to me
that would be annoying
I think I was friends with this guy who works here in 10th grade...
but I'm not sure...
lol
that would be odd
he has the same name, does CS stuff, kind of sounds similar
looks similarish
his name is antonio morales, pretty generic hispanic name
that is pretty generic
lol
you did talk about that guy i think
The hair is totally different
and he hasn't made any indication that he knows me
brb restarting
it rebooted without a gui...
O.o
wat
half of the os programs deleted themselves
fml
read rebooted without a girl
lol
there is no terminal
no gui
nothing
that program just fucked everything
this is the vm, not your pc, right?
it is the pc
>.>
your pc just deleted half of the os programs?
yeah
the laptop has issues
interesting
i just wiped the laptop and am installing 12.04 now. it was on 14.04 before
that'll probably make it easier, since that's the LTS version
14.04 is also LTS
but it is new
so a lot of stuff is still designed for 12.04
buuuuuh
that moment when you realized you fucked up and don't wanna continue work
my video card, motherboard, and PSU had shipping issues so they are delayed a few days :(
told you some of them would take longer :F
yeaaaah
it's worse when your mobo comes last
well, it was delayed but is also shipping out of california
the rest is coming from pennsylvania
so it might still arrive around the same time
And then maybe perhaps league?
I know, dead horse.
I've been trying to build a team for a while.
lol
I'd be down for it
but I'll suck and get you killed for like a week until I get good
The teamwork you saw is rare. Like that was synergestic
so, you asked for it
oh that's fine
the problem is, if you play with me...
you're gonna get matched up to my level
lol
soooo
i recommend going against AI first
then hard AI
people get toxic
and you will die a LOT
but at the same time
you'll advance faster than normal beginners
but you also rage a lot less than most other players
hell even I rage at times
but most of the time it's like "welp, next time Gadget"
"I SWEAR ON ME MUM M8 I'LL BASH YER FOOKIN FACE IN"
XD
that game
just seemed so
idk
odd
it is odd
but you should see the demo I gave nao
demo?
it's like the universe was like "let's get thsi fool addicted"
I played a match while he watched
explained a bit
ah
but seeing the gameplay and interaction taught more than my words could
twitch stream go
like how 3 of us just chain-combo gang-raped this poor soul next to his turret
I don't follow the pros that much..
One of my friends does religiously though. She plays the fantasy league and gets tickets to tournaments all the time.
She's also a bit of a tyrant and super hardlined to the meta.
lol
And rages a lot
she's four feet of fury
i saw someone made a 2d fighting game based on the LoL heroes
it looked really cool
that's ... interesting
so, I got vagrant/virtualbox working on 12.04
well, at least not crashing
I'm not sure what to do next and if this is actually running or what lol
but my boss already left it seems
ok so i watched the trailer
i'm so jealous of their drawing abilities
for the 2d dealio?
lol y eah
ok so facebook creeping has informed me that this antonio fellow did indeed go to atech
apparently I know that guy
lol
lol
Did someone say internet creeping?
Ian: i used an xbox controller and completed the sim tutorial for takeoff/landing
only took me two tries
lol you want to start doing simulator with me?
We'll do cheap to repair planes
we could do that at some point
gonna make food now though
oh also i got the pbj
pretty fun
only gotten like two kills so far though
BOOM BOOM
more like BOOM
...
...
BOOM
...
...
BOOM
that thing has like a 3 second reload though
i want that on a tank
That's the Sherman's gun
wan 3 war thundar?
Cannot yet
have to get my haircut
just did a sim battle, got a few hits on one of their bombers, then proceeded to not see anything for like 10 minutes, then got shot down by a bf109 and made a successful crash landing, resulting in 7k lions and only 5.5k repair cost
all of that was in a p38g
OH MOTHER FUCKER
WHAT
MY EMAIL FROM MY WEBSITE STOPPED WORKING

I'm using Ruby for work right now
I'm using Reichmail

Yes I did
How much RP?
Jebus Electro's theme is epic.
"My Enemy" by Hans Zimmer
check it
it's on spotify
Electro?
from Spiderman 2
wat
We have these things called movie theaters.
Films are shown in color and sound.
I know that
Electro's the electric based villain in Spiderman 2
His musical score is by Hans Zimmer and it's epic.
lol
Creative naming
I see
Well keep in mind he was created in February 1964
And?
His origin date would probably explain his creative naming.
psssh
People were creative then
I think I missed whether you were scoffing or being sarcastic.
They were
lol
Look at all the cool cars and things they made
I mean in his creative naming.
Or your request for me to explain further.
regardless
"My Enemy" by Hans Zimmer
check it
it's on spotify

Andrew that procedueral wings mod appears to work

oh god
I've spent the last 2 hours on the same plane
in KSP
my soul
it has been eaten
However, I made a MiG+Sabre combo that has engines that finally do not overheat at max output
show me
that sounds interesting
i'm guessing mig-15, which is similar to the sabre anyway, so i could see how that would work
Top tested speed 680m/s on alt 10,000m
wow
Armament: 4x 30mm cannon
using the tail jet engine thingy
?
Yes/no
I have it set up to have two engines in 1 tail
interesting
do you have the variable wing mod added to the pack you're using now?
Yes
I'll update the server with that
i'll have to install it and mess around with it tomorrow then
for now, i flee
night
night
transistor looks really really cool
tons of comp sci references
what is transistor?
action rpg made by the guys that did Bastion
vintagebeef put out a video of it today
your attacks are functions
kinda in a digital world
its pretty cool
Aren't all attacks in video games technically functions?
yeah, but this game isnt trying to hide that fact
lol
Fixed damage effect from HE tank rounds, which led to the destruction of the tank when the shell would detonate on the vehicle roof. Now it is still possible to damage the tank by a roof breech, but it won’t lead to the immediate destruction of the vehicle.
I now know why i was instakilled so many times
lol I wish I had known that
Aircraft for PBJ series and B-25 series rudder control efficiency has been increased
yayyy
that was a serious problem trying to fly in realistic with the PBJ
yeah
For things with an H rudder
they were derp
indeed
i am playings now
if you want to join
I would like to, but I am getting ready for work :(
aww
darn kids and your work
back in my day, all we did was play videogames and ignored those "hardworkin american" fools
they significantly increased the reload time for artillery
thank god
I suddenly kinda forgot most html :I
but thankfully it's locked away so I just have to remember some stuff about it
<tag>stuff</tag>
or something like that
lol
also if at any point today you would like to rob banks or jewelery stores or the american embassy, just let me know
lol
hahah maybe after work/dinner
lol tony
I forget any language after not using it for a while
but you pick it back up quickly
thank god
i was like "okay let's liquid layout responsi-tize this....thing...."
*checks school notes*
I'm eating a sammich my mom packed me for lunch :D
lol nice
in my lunch pale
aww so cute, buh bye!
haha
work on any code yet?
I sat and watched my supervisor/boss guy work on this ruby gem used in a project here
he basically just added a helper function to make the code look a bit cleaner
gems are modules right? i forget ruby
then added unit tests
learned it for like a day
lol
tested it all, uploaded to rvm or whatever, edited the actual project to use it, uploaded to git, and called it good
yeah
seems like how every company does code
lol
Then we went in a google hangout with the people in new york working on this
at least you don't have to run your code through that thing google uses to check your formatting
?
i forget what it's called, but google uses some program to check your formatting on your code so that all the code written at google looks the same
that would be nice lol
it would, but it is a friggin hardcore check
we had to try one of our assignments in 302 and it flagged my code as very broken
like
formatting wise
lol
it's a very specific thing
naming conventions, spacing, new lines, bracket placement, line length, etc?
yeah
white space around stuff like i=0 vs i = 0
as long as you know what style it wants, that isnt bad
as well as conventions for each language, like using breaks and returns where they are technically not necessary but you put it there for an edge case kind of thing
yeah
it just takes a bit to get used to the convention
i would have had to change like 100 lines of code out of 250 or something on my linked list implementation
lol
my harddrive is in Henderson
the case, ram, processor, and whatever the other thing was is still in like illinois or something
and the gpu, mobo, and psu are yet to actually ship
I will never order from ncix us again >_<
such a pain
lol
at least you got all of your stuff from one place
I didnt
I got it from 2 places
amazon and ncix us
I got mine at frys, best buy, and amazon, some of which was purchased in store, others were ordered
ncix required us to call our card provider and have them verify that they could ship to our address
seriously?
wow
but iur card provider required us to verify that they could talk to ncix
so, we had to do a 3 way call
with ncix and american express
were the parts just cheaper through ncix or something?
which delayed even processing payment for 3 days
ncix was about $30 - $40 cheaper
wow
well
that's pretty good
maybe worth the trouble even
they are sooo slow though
but so much cheaper
not worth it
lol
lol
I read some reviews after all this
many people have complaints about them
all bad about their process?
yeah
at least its cheap
lol
it may have actually been less savings, too
they force you to get shipping insurance
equal to 12% of the total cost
wow
that may be worth it though
and im not sure how their shippinc costs compare to amazon
how pissed would you be if a part arrived damaged and you couldnt get it replaced
also amazon has good customer service and will generally replace anything damaged in shipping as a standard service
lol
ah
well then
yeah
amazon is good
I'd withold payment on the entire order
amazon and newegg for me
oh yeah
i forgot about newegg
i don't think I actually got anything from frys
i got a few parts there as well
Frys hardly has any of my parts I ordered
lol yeah
i figured they'd have everything
yeah it was weird
I also know they're 100% comission so I don't do much besides window shop there
they didnt have my case, ram, ssd, or video card
they had my ram, psu, and mobo
frys is relatively close to my work
so I was hoping they would have all the stuff
lol
yeah but with that 100% commission you can sometimes find people that actually know their shit and can really help you out
yeah but you also find the opposite sometimes
I have a dude at the frys by my place in california that I get advice from every time i go
and if he isnt there then i ignore them
lol
lol
I honestly can't tell if that is real or not
that's hilarious
twerking lol
texas, lol
alaska, oregon, washington, new mexico, lol
...
funny that utah is searchng kama sutra
ya know
mormons
lol
CA doesn't surprise me
Oregon did though
ALLAH
lol yeeaaaah
lol racist jokes
lol two of my co workers are chatting with each other via HipChat.. while sitting less than 3 feet away from each other irl
what is hipchat
chatting program
that seems like a very efficient use of company time/resources
lol
well they were discussing company stuff
they must not like the voiceboxes the company provided
?
their voices
they must not like talking
lol
this guy reminds me a bit of thal
my supervisor
less ragey than thal though
that sounds like a competent boss then
lol
so
the russian bias in low tier tanks is overwhelming
the t-50 has a shell with 108mm of penetration
the t-50 is OP as hell
Its the same as Russian tier I planes
super bias
LaGGs should all be tier II
murica!
n e 1 want to kerbal
maybe in a bit, i am heading home in a few minutes
okay
I've added a new mod to my pack
nono play tanks with meee
hmmm
ok
Ian
Ian
home yet brandone?
I thought I was having dinner
but
we have nothing to fix
lol
if you send me a link to that mod i'll toss it in my ksp folder and we can do that if you want
i have kv1 now as well
kvOP
spent about 30 seconds trying to kill a t34 prototype, was getting annoyed when i wasnt penetrating it from 1.3 km out
moved to .9 km out, one shot him centre mass
I am debating whether or not I want three uniform monitors, or two like I already have and a nicer/larger one in the middle
GAH
HAH
they're waiting now
oh sonuva
ok adding a margin top to the footer brings the background image down
i don't know how the hell
I read something about margins and stuff earlier
I think it was, any element should have margin/padding OR a set width, but not both
or something
also
i think it said that parent elements should avoid padding/margin and that children should handle that instead
though maybe I'm reversing that
....both kinda make sense though...
oy
hmmm my psu, mobo, and gpu are in sacramento
the rest is in vegas
ups delivers on saturdays right?
ya
it might all get here tomorrow then
if it doesnt, then i'll have to wait till tuesday :(
oh my god
the spacers don't shove the text over enough
ugh
?
the spacer divs don't move the copy over enough
i don't know why it's displaying like that
wait
shit
the copy?
display block didn't work
yeah
-_-
i've never had this much difficulty with html
or css
why now
screenshot?
alt printscreen is a thing, btw :p
wazzat
screenshots only the window that has focus
is that grey bar the <nav> container?
no that's the <footer>
which is confusing as fuck right now
:/ this is very frustrating
I noticed your container sizing seemed wonky in chrome inspecter
If CSS isn't frustrating then you're doing css wrong
so, you're on the right track!
but yeah, open the site with chrome inspecter
then mouse over the 3 <section> tags
er
2 section and 1 footer
the highlighted area doesnt match the actual content
I was gonna look in to that but forgot to. lol
why does it not line up if that's the case? that's so weird
...
changing the margins works
it only has any dimensionality because of padding
but it also moves EVERYTHING ELSE
what was the point of margins then?
the containers without padding have no height
which is probably the cause of the problem
this is because elements are floating
i thought margins also padded it?
ah
margin and padding should be used sparingly imo
oh i pad the heck out of everything
and I just checked what I read ealrier. It said that padding/margin should only be applied to block level elements
would a footer be block level?
yeah
what stands out to me as bad is, if I disable all padding on your site, it seriously messes up positioning
rather than just making stuff slightly more cramped looking
....
is margins a better way to position those?
no
two different things entirely
the main cause for it all appearing out of place is floating those nav buttons I think, though
using css 3 selectors for horizontal position like i linked earlier would probably not be a bad idea
might be less hacky
horizontal position?
like the buttons
they are evenly positioned horizontally
well no i get it but I don't understand how to even them out using css other than inline?
yeah, there are a few ways but they all seem to float the elements anyways
i may be too tired to articulate
lol
sec
lemme try something
theoretically this should all be easy :<
oy
i have my STUFF
and my STYLING
blargh
well
i margin and padded it
so it seeeeeeeeeems to have worked
allegedly
You should use height to size stuff rather than padding
padding should only be used to pad, not size
oy i forgot about that
ok that broke it
lol
by giving it more height it allow the text to wrap up to the side
ok and the p text sits at teh very bottom of the footer
i am so confused
there's a mystery margin appearing on this page and I'm not sure where from, lol
*cries*
should I start over?
aha! it was a default margin value on <p>
wat
god i hate inherent styles
inheritence isnt bad
but
it is a very good idea to remove ALL default styling
ya
is that footer supposed to stick to the bottom of the page or no?
im not sure if i broke it
i'd like it to
but right now it's just floating
so, now it all displays properly I think
I made a few small but significant changes
Those red and green boxes show something important
the overall box structure of the page now has the main blocks (header section, nav section, and footer) all directly 1 after the other
no magical white space inebwteen them
as in, the red and green touch without any white inbetween
as a personal rule, I keep the underlying structure in that format, boxes which are physically touching
I forced the nav section to have a height of 100px
footer has auto height
p no longer has default padding or margins
i added class names to the 2 section tags
in order to set a specific height on the nav area
I would personally ditch the <section> tags entirely though
just use <header> and <nav>
ok that fucked up everything
?
removing the section tags
well yeah, because they were styled
you'll have to refactor the css
i think i need sleep
lol
i'm almost getting like...hostile towards the document
haha
-__- ok bed
thank you for all the help
yeah bed would be a good idea IF NOT FOR THIS DAMN BIRD
lol
cya
also np
night
hi
hi
A friend of mine linked me to some really good html/css style and design rules if you want to see them, tony
yes plz
i have resource lists to update :3
welp i fucked up on the tab indenting lol
lol
sassy css seems cool
Sass is an independent black woman who don't need no man
sass confused me
sass is certaintly more complex but it seems more powerful too
Also for anyone who is interested: 50% off of purchasing premium today on War Thunder
All of my computer parts are in Nevada now :D
wooooo
woo
for serious I'm tempted to start over this site from scratch
suddenly
it works
lol
@_@
my other pages will be better
I want to try making a rails website
with proper html5/css3 standards, since I've never really stuck super strongly to web standards
it even works in IE
let me know if you need graphics
well, unfortunately I'd need a VPS/web host to make a rails site
unless I just did a local site on a vm I guess
link to site?
it's local
ahhh
...I actually wonder if I can do the 2 stacked bg images in CSS or I need a program
er, script
You should be able to do it in pure css I would think
there needs to be some sort of trigger that causes them to scroll though
all i need to be able to do is to get an image behind the background image
after that I can set everything else up with js and all that
yeah, that's just z-index
will changing z-index remove it's block level? like...not have it shoved off to the side?
z index just changes the render order
so i'll have to do some weird positioning then...
oh
your background is on the html (root) element
you'll have to change that
then do i put it in the html?
....can you style an element on the page to be a background image?
like the url/#thing ?
you can just make a div that acts as the background
will it go behind the background image?
it?
the div that acts as the background?
it is the background
do you remember what I wanted to do?
yes
the div shows background-image: url('images/logowindow.png');
theeeeeen I'm confused
you want images to show up behind the transparent image logowindow.png
logowindow.png needs to be a div, not the html element
yes, but i'm making a separate div instead of body?
<body><div class="logo-window">stuff</div></body>
that's interesting
ok
and the slider goes inbetween <body> and <div...>
you can't render something behind body
which is the issue
ahah
wait i just confused myself even more
i thought  ahead and now it doesn't make sense :<
lol
what doesnt?
Like... having an animated carousel as the background image... is that possible, or would I just make 2 divs, one per layer?
1 for the slidewho and one for the window
lol slidewho
you have a div that has the window
you also have a div that contains the slide elements
roit
this second div has a z-index of like -10
would i use background-image styling then, or just img tags?
if you can do it with css, do it with css
still shoves it out of the way...
getting there...
what shoves what?
div one puts div two below it
erm
div one and two being what?
window and slider
slider gets put vertically down
use position: absolute on both
window positioned at top left
oooh somethign changed
slider positioned centered
. . .
nnnno
i very much can't wait for sunday nigh
holy hell
lol
i gotta work
feeeeeck
cya
see ya
(srsly it broke it so hard doing that positioning
im scurred)
if the are positioned absolutely then moving them shouldnt affect anything else on the screen
bah
i'll fix it after work
will be late
cya
see ya
I just had Ricardos
I just saw spoderman 2
I TOTALLY FORGOT THIS IS A 3 DAY WEEKEND
I just became happier
lol
tony I just found a really cool css 3 way of positioning your nav buttons
don't tell me that
how
i was about to do crime
lol
display: flex
flex?
I read that
didn't know what it does
align-items: center
it's like magic
...
it broke things more
did you place those on nav?
not on nave holdup
well that's neat
lol
i'm going to do crime
and then fix this
because right now the background images are wonk
guys
black flag is $40 on steam
ok
can code
ok
ok
how to absolutely center something?
using position absolute?
yeah
i dont think you can
...
dang
on your site, did you want the background logo to change position based on page size?
the way you had it with background set on the html element centered vertically, it changes position as the size of the page changes
changes ont he horizontal axis or vertical?
vertical
that was fine
i'd like it to be centered horizontally
or i might do what everyone else does and just :< fade the images
er
why can't i speak
just do a gigantic slider
my god i'm confused
i had to set the backgroudn image to fixed position then move the window dive to absolute
wait
O.O
THAT FUCKING CENTERED IT
WHAT
nao
better yet
Did you end up reading that google style guide I linked earlier?
yeah
I still don't know if I should tab CSS or space space it
do two spaces
never do actual tabs for code
that applies to html too
i've been spacing html
not css
so i'll do that
which is weird because everywhere else does...
you can set notepad++ to do two spaces when you hit tab
oh!
the advantage of spaces is that it will appear the same for everyone no matter how they view it
whether it is on github, notepad++, notepad, mac, linux
it will always look the same
tabs are displayed differently everywhere
hmmmm
next weekend is an occulus rift hackathon in california
and they will have several dev kits to give out...
hackathon?
several of the main people behind occulus will be there
there will be presentations on the technology and stuff
nex weekend...
-_- I'm flying to Oregon lol
and they will presumably let developers try it out
what are you going to oregon for?
Picking up Mai's free car
o_O
lol her uncle gave it to her
lol
so we're flying up then driving down
lol
that will be a long drive
is it oregon....?
i want my computer :l
Sorry, derp, Utah
lol
that's not as bad
dont' know why i thought oregon
anywhere that's not vegas: oregon
even cali is oregon
so
I took a stab at your web page
if you want to see what I did
sure
._.
positioning probably isnt what you had in mind
also the scrolling background images arent there
because I don't think that background window is positioning correctly
sublime looks so much nicer than notepad++: http://i.imgur.com/HaojULj.png
did you remove the head/body tags?
i did
WHY
Google style guide said to
wt
wat
wat srsly
what
yeah
not needed
waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat
not even for graceful degradation?
reduces page size and indentation level
apparently not
that's so weird
theres certaintly no problem with keeping them
but I wanted to see if it really worked
lol
that' soooooo weird
if you view it with chrome inspecter, the tags show up
THAT'S SO WEIRD
now that people are moving beyond xhtml, apparently it is preferable to not do <br /> etc instead of <br> etc
wait
so now <br> instead of <br />
There are a few quirks about having comments in certain areas when not including the optional tags (body, html, head, etc) so I'd probably still include them
yeah
also <p>
and no </p>
????
I'm not sure how that works, but thats what it said to do
I don' tknow what to believe anymore
lol
and on top of all that
it IS butter
NNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
lol
by the way does the icon look ok?
LOL
I saw that you had an icon in code but never actually looked at it
lol
mine's back to icon.png
i wanted to see how observant you were
and/or your reaction
lol
my bird nemesis will be waking up in about an hour
use yer arrows
I have already considered doing that
or at least destroy his home
too dark outside
I have to wait for him to make noise to have any hope of finding him
which, he'll make plenty of noise in 53 minutes, give or take
lol
so damn close
nope
now z indexes are borked
wait
div a nested in div b
can a and b have different z indexes?
yes
THEN WHY IS IT NOT WORKING T_T
what are the z indexes set to?
-5 and -10
weird
I don't think it's possible
i set the nester to 1 and it brought up both elements above the other elements
the nested element will inherit from the parent
any way to prevent that...
i finally got the sucker lined up
wait
got it
i'll nest it in a different div with similar styling but have different z indexes
or is that overthought?
without seeing code I can't say
dude
reminds me of back in the day when my brother strapped blankets and pillows on me and forced me to fight
lol
good times
pillow-mech or not, that's a big mofo
lol
apparently it's from Community
nao
nao why
lolol
it is artsy!
nao stop
i wonder if we should give her illustrator
no
i don't think she'd be able to do anything with it...
no
lololol
no
...
ok i broke it again
so bork
the bird hasn't started
maybe he died :D
lol
umm
ok
i seem to have broken it extra hard now
WAIT
WAIT
WAAAAAIIIIYYYYYYT
THAT FUCKING BIRD IS BACK
lol
wait
nao
idea
What if.
My website
is the bird
is it twitter?
no
then I think we're safe
i'm just saying my problems seem to arise to yours
again
i can't words
I hate this bird
more than anything in the world
bang on the window?
no effect
also my parents are asleep so I can't be loud
lol
lol: http://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/26dz5p/mining_in_runescape/
XD
every damn time
plz don't tell me you're thinking of runescape
nope
it was on /r/all
lol great
ok bed time
night
nite
have you murdered the bird yet
a wella bird bird birt
murdered the bird
that WT music video is so weird
good song but weeeeeiiiird music
the and we run video?
yah
song works
lol yeah
music vid is interesting
Sharron is kinda weird in all of the videos
yuh...
wtf
seriously
placehold.it died
so my placeholder images are gone/borked
so i actually CAN'T work on anything
gah
lol
can you not set a div as a background image?
that would solve all my problems
if the div is the background, yes
T_T
background image - url"index.html/#slick"
wat
;p;
lol
that's what I want to do :<
how does that make any sense
lol
because as the backgroudn image the image behaves differently
it kinda auto-centers
yes, but a div is not an image
i know
but if I could get a "bgdiv" instead of bgimg
just make the div 100% width, position it absolutely to the top left, give it the background image
but it can't be an image :< it has to be a div
the slider is in a div
then wrap the slider and center it (margin: 0 auto;)
or use display: flux
which works in all modern browsers but may break in older ones
why the hell didn't a wrapper come up earlier
that kinda solved it
like
positionng and I'm done
i even tried that earlier
gah
almost
so close
so close
KSP anyone?
we just found a massive pile of bird crap... probably from that same bird that chirps outside my window every night
That sounds like a problem
hi
hi
i just checked on our base at chroma hills lol

i can only download in like 20 MB bursts and then I have to manually reset the download....
apparently this is just how payday 2 downloads
and a few other games
I had some strange dreams last night
?
In the first one, my mom and I were scavenging an abandoned house for supplies in a post-apocalyptic world. The town we were in was being evacuated but we needed supplies before we left
and then we got in a car with some other refugees
and I dropped my flashlight as I got in
and I wanted to get it back but one of the infected people was standing over it
then he reached for me so I slammed the car door on his hand
and left my flashlight but I was really bummed
In the second dream, I was riding my lawn mover around town
then I got in my dad's truck but accidentally forgot my lawn mower
so I had to run all the way back down the coast to try to find it
but there were tons of weird people
you're weird
Yeah
WAT THE FUCK
...
i'm so confused
so so so confused
my wrapper
has no height
but a width
if i make it the height
instead of the width
it messes up
I'M
SO

Originate secretly owns UNR
lol
my supervisor is out today so I have nothing to do
I was gonna research rspec today, but turns out there isnt that much to it and it only took me about 40 minutes....
@_@
use their resources to make something of your own?
hahahahaha my package just arrived at my mom's desk
it is HUGE
like holy crap
they are moving it around with a dolly
wtf did you order in there?
case, ram, ssd, cpu
lol ahah
lmao
jeeeeeeeeeze
hahaha
god dangit it is so hard not to just burst out laughing right now. my mom was all like "ITS FREAKING HUGE LOL"
lol
ok i can't find the dang trailer
nao
found it
now I know wtf those things were
i thought it was some containment weapon
That feel when you're hungry but are lazy.
lol
lol
Nice weather today though
nein
hot
I like it
sitting in a car is like sitting in an oven
Nah
just roll your windows down
wasnt my car and someone was on the phone so it would have been too loud
that lets in more hot
Weren't both of you born and raised here?
yes
I'm really okay with the heat
You'd think you would be from living here
I prefer a cool 70
I can deal with the heat but I still prefer cooler weather
boo
90 is best
no
70ish
90 is so nice though
70 is nicer
70 is too cold
70 isnt cold
Yes it is
70 is shorts weather and amazing
I'll still wear shorts at 70 but its too cold
working on that desk in this heat sucks
born and raised here
hence I prefer colder weather
guh
it is very very hard to make a living doing graphic design freelance
when the only people who know you can't afford a logo
BLARGH
lol
I
will pay you
$0.50
For a logo
and unlimited rights to it
that'll get you 1/1000th of a logo
I can't pay $50 for a logo! thats mad!
lol
That and I can use adobe software myself
lol
oh sorry, 1/10,000th of a logo
wut
$500 is a lot of money
a logo can be worth $500 - $500,000
to millions actually
depending on usage rights, time limits, print/digital use, agency designed, in-house, third-party, pre-built
It's weird to calculate costs.
Consider that a business that does terrible can make something like $1,000 on a slow, slow slow day
In profit.
It's in business let's say for only 8 hours a day
4 days a week.
9 months in business
Hire me
lol
1,152,000
in profit
just for shits and giggles let's cut that in half
Also
Hire me
I can do stuff
576k
for 4.5 mo
a $50,000 logo is "worth it"
$500 is "uber super duper wirth it"
problem is
people who want me to do a logo for them
have a net profit of $0 a day
lol
Effect businesses I see
they're just starting
Now, I will work for trade.
Free food, photos, etc.
er, "Free"
anyways, I can't hire you
I'm also making $0/day
lol
Well
Consider this my future application
lol
@_@
well if I'm to seriously consider it, do you have a portfolio?
Its not digital
lololololol
I've done everything on paper
I may require some training
but I have good taste
that's fine, i'll take low-res scans even just to see concepts, etc
taste is nice but execution is what matters in business I'm afraid
I'd be happy to drive up concepts live as well
that even applies to me :<
I also have 4 years off exp. dealing with whiny people
lol I have 5 >w<
woo
I could even do colouring
lol
Define coloring?
lol as in the outdated thing
youi know, crayons, lines, etc
Where you take designs
and add colour
to size up?
Like with lithographs
GODDANGIT MY LIGHTBULB JUST DIED
pass
??
pass?
Anywhos
This is just for possible maybe eventually anyways
my mobo, gpu, and psu left Tonopah an hour ago
I have my computer case
it is beautiful
be - e - a - utiful
the whole front panel is just blank white
no disk drive, no fans, nothing. just plain
img?
picture of an actual molecule: http://i.imgur.com/vMSL25I.jpg
i dont have an actual picture, I'll take pics tomorrow while I build it
it's the NZXT H440
ooh
pretty
it's a heavy case lol
are you actually going to use watercooling?
I might water cool the cpu, but I'll have to order the water cooler
you may not need to
it's quieter though
compared to a cpu fan
even with my top fan not working I've not been overheating
I will at least add either two more fans on the top of the case or water cooling
...although I could watercool
your computer is in a significantly colder house too lol
which helps
OH right
how's the desk
One leg is glued together, three more halves of legs are glued together
it's slow, the glue has to sit for a few hours and we only have enough clamps to do two halves or one whole at a time
8 legs in total, 16 halves
goooood god
lol
got all summer to build it
Rent more clamps
does home depot rent clamps?
Possibly
I'd check like Ahern
the tracker says my last package was delivered :D
woo!
quick
skype randomly decided to renotify me about like every single message ever sent in this chat room
That may have been me loading it up on my phone?
Not sure though
no, it's the derpy linux version of skype
it crashed shortly after lol
Lol
linux skype makes me sad
BF3 is now free on Origin.
so
the new computer lives
IT LIVES
gotta go buy an adapter for the 3rd monitor and install windows
Windows 7?
soon yes
No OS as of now?
yeah
getting win7 from dreamspark
Gonna dual boot with Ubuntu?
nah
vm
that works
AWESOME
this is the slowest freaking usb boot device maker thing
also window's official windows 7 download method doesnt work
it stalls at 0%
>_>
...
don't do the official download method?
or is that the only method
it is the official download method
and it sucks
lol
had to download it from an unofficial source
lol wow
this new computer is so quiet
i love it
the case has a built in button on the back that turns on two LEDs that light up the ports on the back
nice
installing drivers without internet or a disk drive is a pain
How are you doing it?
USB?
yeah
just for the LAN drivers
then I'll have internet on it and be able to just download them directly
woo 3 monitors
what game should I test nvidia surround on?
Werrr Thunderrrrr
downloading
woo
ETA?
a while lol
lol
of course
my right monitor is really blue for some reason
my third monitor seems to be bad
it's actually the oldest and most used of the three, but I've never used it side by side with another one
so I didnt realize it was so blue lol
lol calibrations is nice
it isnt a calibration problem
monitor settings are exactly the same
swapping outputs to that monitor maintains the blueness, so I know it isnt a problem with that output on my gpu
I'll just package it up and return it, since the newest of the 3 is still covered by the 15 day return policy
and pretend that it is the same monitor I recently bought
I know monitor settings are teh same, but have you color calibrated it?
you should be able to do a Wizard or somesuch
I tried, but it is like majorly blue
D: ah
Also I'm using nvidia surround
so all of them are getting the exact same calibration
the other two match perfectly
there is only one more of these monitors in town... all the way in henderson >_<
does sound color calibrate?
sound color?
i'm saying color calibrate, but you said they all got the same calibration with nvidia surround?
ooooh i thought surround sound lol
wait, same calibration as in same output or same settings?
Adjusting system settings adjusts all three. Even then, there is no way to get white to display on that particular monitor
can you adjust them independently?
I can, but like I said, it is IMPOSSIBLE to get that monitor to display white
damn
war thunder looks amazing
lol
lol does it?
How is it?
I'm on movie settings + 3 screens
lol
want to do a battle?
In cockpit view it is pretty cool
Nah, tomorrow. Still gotta finish installing some stuff
lol okay
Good luck
Evil Angel by Breaking Benjamin has been stuck in my head for two days
Put me to sleeeeeep eeeeevil annnngeyuuuull....
Can I ask how you secured your internship? Was it through a school connection program?
They came to a career fair
thats how I found them
then I interviewed
darn -_-
i want to go home and use my new computer more
I want a job :<
come work at originate
...
do they need designers?
just show up every day and eventually people might just assume you're a real employee but you somehow didnt get set up right and they will set you up
o.o
lol
when they as just be like "no i work here"
"I'm Tony... from design..? Carol how could you forget."
"Carol, who is that?" "That's Tony from design, how could you forget Jenkins?"
lol
I am starting to actually get some progress and understanding of this project I'm working on
that's good
so tony, I've been working on the front end of this Updater website a bit
they way they do web design is entirely different than you or I do it. lol
you dont even directly write html or javascript
Don't call the fbi but this made me lol http://imgur.com/gallery/kLvIu1N
Depends
What method are you using
And what weapon
hmm I may try the machete
I'd guess about 8 people
A gun of any type would feel a bit cheaty
lol
I personally
would get two squirt guns
and duct tape them together
One will be filled with bleach, the other amonia
Tada
hmm
wow
that's messed up
Instant kill all living stuff
We all think about it :P
(Gas mask required)
yeah
You could always make a flamethrower
Its not a gun per se
molotov the entrances
anyways
We'd better change topic
or we'll move up on the watch list.
indeed
naaaoooo D:
hi
we went for shaved ice
....work went for shaved ice?
yeah
@_@
so, my lips/teeth/tongue are all bright blue from that shaved ice
Alex just came over to help me push my changes to the git repo
he said
"Your lips are blue. your TEETh are blue. I'm not even going to ask what you did to that smurf while you were at lunch"
lol
classic Alex
5real tho
nice though lol
-_-
I'm so annoyed with my interview :<
you had an interview?
I would have had that job. If I had experience. :/
the MarQI one
I told you how they had someone with more experience take the position, right?
From the Vietnamese department
uhhh no
oh
well
Yeah, they were looking for someone with more experience.
As always.
looks like frictional games is working on a new game
sci-fi horror
looks like they arent partnered with the chinese room on this one too, so it should actually be good
trailer says , so we can expect it some time late 
how good is google docs now? I'm considering just using it instead of ms office
i haven't noticed that it changes
lol i never use MS office thouh
ok what in the how

i don't know what i've done
i broke things
umm

lol
i don't understand
ahhh yissss 5 fps in minecraft!
with every setting maxed on SEUS shaders
D: oh good god
it looks beautiful though
"ill let you know when a coder get back to me and hopefully finds out the problem"
motherfucker
He asked me for help with coding :I
lol
coding what?
WP site -_-
holy jesus this water looks amazing
I get a solid 30 fps with optifine + shaders
lol
quake pro + 3 screens lol
god
ok the shaders look beast
wow
holding a torch in my hand lights up the area as i walk
fancy
THERE ARE ALWAYS WINDOWS UPDATES
>_<
ALWAYS
I'd rather have a virus than updates on every shutdown
lol it'll be like that for about a month
I wouldnt be suprised if there was a virus that made fake update notifications on every shutdown
I had updates disabled on my laptop for like a year actually
I'm pretty pleased with the wire management
that is spacious and beautimous
too funny had to share
I hate waking up so late
lol that's awesome
...
payday is on sale
less than a week after I bought it

I'm going to paint a map of Europe

Such a Crysis
ender dragon xp farm in vanilla
wow
lol
Anyone want to play Kerbal?
??
I know the feeling Nao :<
?
seeing payday on sale
watch dogs is pretty fun
doesnt work with 3 monitors though
that's encouraging
aww lol
it works, but it is super zoomed in and you can't adjust FOV
so it's like playing with binoculars and half a gui
yikes
oh
tony
I learned more web app stuff today
angularJS is amazing
?
i don't know what that is :D
It is amazing
1 sec
1 min
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html ng-app>
<head>
   <title>Hello World, AngularJS - ViralPatel.net</title>
   <script type="text/javascript"
       src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.2.16/angular.min.js"></script>

</head>
<body>
      Write some text in textbox:
   <input type="text" ng-model="sometext" />

   <h1>Hello {{ sometext }}</h1>
  </body>
</html>
put that in a html file and try it out
that's basically hello world in angular
ok that's cool
it is capable of doing so much more than that too
like, hook it up to a database and it can inject data into the page
for a blog or something
it also has built in animation capabilities
jeebus
Yeah... The Updater project uses Angular, and I had no clue what angular was or how to use it while working on it
AFTER I finished all of it, my Alex told me to research angular
er
Alex*
lol
It would have been so much easier the other way around
lol
oh also another huge feature oa Angular is the ability to load partials onto a page
so you can have a single page application
with the a header and footer, but the main content can be dynamically loaded
and each partial is just another angular html file/controller
that's so weird
ok i need sleep D:
hi
hi
something in my wobsite borked
a field won't highlight when typing in
what do you mean?
it might still be up... did you get the zip file I sent last time?
when did you send it? I dont remember if it was this computer or my laptop
orite
a while ago
(DL League maybe if you still want to)
sec
erm
i have scybreak.rar
dated?
5/29/14
i think that's it
if it has contact.html
and in teh scybreak.css it has something from css-tricks
just index and gallery
feck
hold on
trying a few things
don't you have a web server?
uhhh
yeah just not linked to html
i have no idea to display an html page
it's just wordpress
do you have ftp access?
i don't have an ftp server
do you have ssh access then?
yeah
you can install a ftp server then ftp in and upload the entire scybreak folder
I have no idea how ot go about that...
or what servers are better...
etc
vsftpd seems to be the one everyone uses
I just tried to throw a guy that had cancer off the dock into the ocean in watch dogs
why
because
monster
I am the vigilante
vig Aliante
Vig Aliante Station Casino
dammit
boo
everytime i try to ssh
connection refused?
YOU'VE KILLED IT
WIPE YOUR SERVER
NAOW
lol (don't do that)
doesn't even ask for a password
Did you do something to your perms?
not ot my knowledge
connection timeout
connecting by putty?
yeah
it times out before establishing a connection to the server?
yeah
is the ip correct?
yeah
are you sure? lol
wait, connection refused
wait got it
how ot you halt aprocess
ctrl c
delete the system kernal
ok
what is xferlog?
sounds like something that logs transfers
do i want to turn that off?
um
doesnt matter
they have a lot of extra stuff they tell you on these install tutorials
kill -9 urmum
oh god i have no idea if this is secure or not
what would you guys charge someone to go to their house and transfer their files from one pc to another?
email, itunes, browser settings
depends on the size of the file
1-2 hours
how far away is it?
not far
eh $30
what would you guys charge someone to go to their house and transfer their files from one pc to another?
if it's really jus ta file transfer from A to B...
Hmm
Depends
Are you configuring anything?
And how are you transfering the files
as far as I know just transfering
probably just via usb drive
That's slow
"type XYZ in the command line"
I'd charge like $50
I told her $40
Assuming it will consume more than an hour
"now do a triple-axel kick flip off a helicoptor chasing down Wolvering on a motorcycle whilst reciting the star spangled banner in E-minor"
lol
$40's not bad
wow
she replied "no! We'll give him $100"
WHAT THE FUCK
DEAL
-_-
why can't people be that generous with design
$20/hr
lol
well.... we're on a budget...
"$15....?"
"eeehhhh"
Computers get you instant results
That's why
lol
"$10 please? I'll only charge you 50% and the rest you can just pay me in food"
deal
T_T
fuck my industry's customers man
lol
$100. not bad
no not bad at all
$30 / hour
I'm so jelly I need peanut butter.
lol
Transfering itunes is easy I believe. outlook shouldnt be too hard too
umm...halp?
The next step in this thing is to change the configurations file but I have no idea how to get to that
link to the instructions you're using?
step 2?
yeah...
cd /etc/
nano vsftpd.conf
thank you
those instructions may be better
it tells you what config options to change
when you log in, what username do you use?
root
I can change that
wait, can I/ should I?
well, you can ftp as root
technically I suppose it is better to set up another user and use it instead
but that's your call
I don't know the process behind doing that
me either :< gonna wing it
well that's disappointing. there's a guy in the park with a quad copter and I can't hack it
lol could you usually?
the drones UNR uses just use unsecure wifi hotspots
hahah
oh hell
lol
ok so now i'm locked in the userlist
and can't break out
?
i made a new userlist
so i could add the user
annnnd now i can't get back
so... you're stuck editing the file or what?
yes
in nano?
yes
ctrl x followed by y to exit and save
ctrl x or ctrl c dont work?
nope
oh fuck why can't i edit configs now
gotit
oy
..mmmnmaybe
i can't save it now -_-
oh good god
:/
so now I don't know if I have an ftp or not
nope
are you sure you're using nano and not vi?
that looks like vi
i was using vi
lol
theres your problem
it told me to use vi -_-
vi is the devil
use nano
the hell is vi?
the devil
no joke
still not working
ummm
I'll figure it out monday -_-
i hav ea flight
cya
thank you for the help
see ya
nano 5lyfe
nano is so good
a bunch of people at my work use vi
y
those who don't tend to use sublime
Y no nano
nano doesn't have syntax highlighting or tabs or a bunch of other features
unless there are plugins that add that
Nano is still easy
though
but they use vi/vim because you can have a bunch of files open on the screen at once
and terminals
so you can see everything and compile and test and whatever easily
it makes sense, but I still hate vi
shaders + 128x texture pack, solid 60 fps :D
lol ez
also linx?
?
linx 3 shaders+texturepack
?
Sir, might I have the link for the shaders and the texture pack?
?
I only speak jive
Ehh mang, can you slide the connection to those packs my way?
sure ting mang
that adds shader support but no shaders
shaders
second one, the SEUS SPECIAL LATEST
i suggest getting optifine too
this is all for 1.7.5
oerpterfine
I modified my seus to drastically reduce the DoF effect
but still keep it enabled

Andrew knows what it is
Derkters
I am bored
I was bored
so I made a fancy steak dinner
with wine sauce and everything
so
so
transfering files to that person's new pc took longer than expected
but she paid me $150 since it took long
Woo
greetings doctors
Greetangs
i wonder where andrew disappeared to
um back

Hi guys
I just got off a long day of work
hi
I just got home from a long boring day of work
are those mechs?
You could say that
People actually made walkers.... oh my god.
lol
They are unarmoured
Quite impressive either way.
i need to do something
Such as?
not sit around -_-
create something
I think we should start a project
maybe not our robot
but a project
maybe
i almost forgout about my website
but i still have gobs of time
what's your idea?
I want to create a web app
I like medieval weapons
angular js has stuff for making mobile applications too
swipe support and such
Anthony you like Medieval weapons yes?
Or something steam powered could be fun
i do
brandon i have an idea
it's stupid simple but it may pay off
and i do like medieval weapons
always wanted a custom knife
what is your idea?
Anthony
Better Idea
Halberd
can't use axes
it'd be cool but I can' tuse those on teh battlefield
Awww
Billhook?
"not an axe"
i can't use crushing weapons
they're more likely to allow a Naganata or Kwandao (maybe)
Oh god I still haven't setu p my ftp
zweihander? :D
those are allowed of course
Or we could make a steam powered something
Steam is fun
and only kinda dangerous
I want to make something I can use.
Hmmm
Potato cannon?
lol
STEAM POWERED POTATO CANNON
Hmm
Flail?
Mace?
OH
Anthony
Glave
Boom
Best option
i like that
Or
a Voulge
Brandon is playing Payday 2
yes, he is
well he isnt any more
but he was
Failure: Because your best isn't good enough.
so what's it mean if you can't get something to fail despite trying your hardest to do so?
You fail at failing.
lol
I don't know if that counts as a success though, since success is considered a failure by those conditions.
I had purposely broken tests in my code that were failing to fail
Lol oh wow
wooo I completed a feature without having to ask 5000 questions :D
woooooo
HEY YOU GUYS
I HAVE MY COMPUTER SET UP IN RENO
who is this andrew guy?!
THE ONLY THING I NEED NOW IS CAPS LOCK TO TURN OFF AND THE INTERNET TO GO FROM .25mb/s to 25mb/s
why is internet slow?
because cheap
i'm working on having them improve it
it's a 5 year in progress deal
um
in reno?
no
in california
[16:43:53] : I HAVE MY COMPUTER SET UP IN RENO
lol
oh
oops
i meant in sacto
:F
lol
I have my new computer set up too :D
yayy
how is it?
its awesome
I've further organized a few of those wires since these pictures were taken
that looks absolutely gorgeous
your computer
not the speedtest
lol
try running anything crazy yet?
ironically your speed test hasnt loaded in my browser yet
Been playing watch dogs
orlly?
good?
also tried out Crysis 2 and minecraft with shaders
its fun
cool
try skyrim with a ton of hd mods
my computer handles them pretty well
I dont have a legit skyrim lol
i get like 30 fps with one of the total hd overhauls
I'm waiting for the steam summer sale before buying new games
legit skyrim is legit
yeah
but the steam summer sale is at the end of summer
lol
well, end of our summer
yeah
its usually late june/early july i think
also my case seems smaller than yours
it was like mid july to end august last year
i think
really?
it might just be because it's white/square
maybe
we'll have to compare when back in reno
that right screen fixed yet?
lol
no
:F
that's no fun
there are no more places selling that monitor
lol
oboy
so you bought three of a monitor that nobody sells anymore
It isnt as bad as the image makes it seem
ah
so not bad for your google search screen
It's tolerable
but bad for three screen gaming
three screen gaming is... meh
lol
reallyy?
yeah
porque
well, most games have poor support
like, they work, but the gui doesnt look good
makes sense
watch dogs is unplayable on 3
you cant adjust your FOV
o.o
odd
and your vertical fov gets greatly reduced
so you can't see crap
lol
minecraft on quake pro + 3 screens is actually pretty good
war thunder is also good
crysis on 3 screens was annoying
bad gui scaling on 3 screens
war thunder in sim mode?
war thunder on a test flight
lol
I haven't done anything other than that
you should definitely try sim mode
:F
i feel like that'd be an amazing advantage
but i could be wrong
maybe
but
the side screens really just blur out lol
all I look at is the middle screen
and am vaguely aware of colors and shapes to the sides
sup
War Thunder

Anyone see Sniper Elite III on steam?
For preorder
(ya'll can answer that when you get back)
nnnnope
Oh hi Meztony
hi
so
goovil news
att can only do 3mb/s max at our location
so we're probably switching to comcast
IF they do service at our house
which they may not
if they do, then we'll have to get them to come out and install
so it will be a few days before i can play probably
i'll mess around and see what I can run with .8mb/s down
this war thunder update is going to take hours
(guessing, but lets face it)
oh dear
1 hour
for 300mb
oh sorry 2 hours
>.>
oy
lol

ikr
y brandon no reply
when steam updates take 10 minutes, you know you're gonna have a bad time
yeah....
in order to ensure war thunder downloaded the update at the highest possible speed i even turned off skype
wow
and?
it still took 2 hours
wow
long time
very
yay job
I had a pulse so they hired me.
who?
Detailer at a Ford Dealership
you're detailing cars then?
yeah
i knew a guy who did that once
. . .
lol ok
any more info on that guy
his name was mark
"big daddy"
oy
lol
Yeah I kinda feel lame taking this job.
Totally not what I want to be when I grow up.
well at least it's money while you continue looking for your desired job
yeah
that's kinda what I need now
well, not need
want
losing my mind looking for jobs with dead ends
I still want to make a web app
what should I make?
I was thinking maybe a Doctors website, but I'm not sure there would be much content to that
Doctors homepage: go away
btw, Angular has a super simple way to make a thing like that slider on your site
Which Ferd Dealership?
Ann and 95
That's wayyyyy out there
(for me)
lol 12 minutes forme
I got like 7-8 hours of sleep last night and am super tired. the night before i got around 5 hours and wasnt tired at all

because Circadian rhythm
I'm hoping I'll feel better after my first day of work.
dogetors
dogetor
grats on job tony

so need
in the meantime, my internet is struggling to load the images on steam's homepage
>.>
how is internship brandone
Mez need an apprentice? plz :P
internship is good
I'm learning more about git right now
sounds useful
yeah
you ever learn about TDD?
never even heard of it (at least from the acronym)
test driven development
oh
yeah
little bit
it's a bit of a pain sometimes but it's actually pretty useful
it seems like the logical way to make production code
er
productive
yeah
I may try it out for school stuff next semester
wouldnt that take a bit longer?
a bit
maybe
if it catches a bug early on that can save a lot of time
true
it would have saved me a LOT of time on that CV stuff
probably lol
definitely
I had helper functions/modules that had problems that went unnoticed for a long time
sneaky help, always trying to overthrow the master
i want to play game
but
internet
soslow
badong
well, going to let steam update everything. be back in 10 hours
actually i lied
none of this is stuff i play
lol
lol
meincraft
i am so tired >_<
I have to read these git instructions like 4 times before I even realize I'm reading something
my co-workers to my left are talking about "making it soft or hard"
and "slapping it in"
taken out of context this would sound so weird
lool
brandoni
wut u dooin
I want an apprentice.
More than that, I want to BE an apprentice.
lol
I don't want to detail cars for a living :/
are you also at DSW still?
send out samples of your art
yeah I am
i just don't know where to send them exactly
google, apple :P
who knows, depends on what you are planning to send
i don't think i'm that qualified yet
...I haven't even started this Detailing job and I already feel miserable. Dislike.
I apparently have access to a bunch of files on the unr cse server that I probably shouldn't have access to
>:3
I see a bunch of home movies that Sushil uploaded
uh oh
and have access to random student's university web pages
....watcha gonna do or not do?
hi
high
I've injured my back
lol
how?
Working yesterday
doing what?
Moving boxes
did you throw out your back like an old man?
No, its a muscluar strain in my upper back
I am currently on a muscle relaxent
which feels weird
that sounds painful
Yes
it is
Brandon
want to play a game?
Or are you working
I'm at work
lol
ahh
I have nothing to do because they are refactoring code all day today
you getting paid for that?
and we can't make new features till that is done
yeah
WOO
I'm looking in to re-doing my website with angular
angular?
is that the magic thing?
yeah
i'll mostly be using it for animation magic
and filtering
filtering?
but also for stuff like making an easy to update nav bar
yeah
so if i have a list of data (like projects I've worked on), then I can type a project name and filter that list
afk lunch
hai
hai
how goes the pipeline?
slow
dad seems reluctant for some reason
i'm sure it's just because he's working and busy
but that's unfortunate because I can't do everything they can, since it's their house
oh yay, this war thunder update is only 22mb, so it'll only take 20 minutes
:F
What happened to your back?
who
me?
Ian :P
ian hurt his back via moving boxes
some kind of muscle pull thingy
No, its a muscluar strain in my upper back
I am currently on a muscle relaxent
which feels weird
<<< 
Hello
Im right by Ricardos right now

xD
The canibals are unkillable apparently
yeah
but cool idea
wuuut
lame
lol
ohi ngame
unless you can run from them
then that's just a feature
lol
"feature"
like
skiing in tribes
lol yus
wow
everything needs to update
gayy
my update list is up to 9 now
and it would take absolute days to finish
:F
war thunder is almost done though
hm
ok so
They ran a background check on me and said I was unhirable
this of course means that my dad's name popped up as well as mine / instead ofmine
wut
o_O
and i was really really really happy that I didn't have to take the job
sooooooo
I'm probably not gonna take that detailing job.
well, you did say you didnt really want it
Yeah like
it's weird
Its all that crime you been doing
i felt a strange desperation to get a job/any job
lol Brandon
lol
awwww
gaijin increased the battle rating of the good buffalo
and decreased the bearcat and panther >.>
interesting
they also lowered the japanese sabre
weird
for those with interest
New crap plane for japan
not a good one
of course
i feel like japan is there for coolish looking old planes which you fly for the fun of it
when they show Japan much needed love :(
while the other countries have warplanes
They are missing so many actually good planes
japan needin some love fo sho
yeah
Where is Ki-100?
the ki-96 got bumbed up in rank as well :(
They made 400 Ki-100s
Where is H8K?
No Ki-201
Jet fighter
They built 20
which is 5x the number of I-185s built
lol
And there are TWO I-185 varients
and they have 2
yeah
*there
HA
caught another one
lol
A7M
9 were built
still more than I-185
*than
those muscle relaxants really ruin your spelling
lol
I am on muscle relaxant
okay
okay
haha
MOTHER FUCKERS NO WAY
GUYS
wat
A7M has 2 13.2mm
WHAT IF THE REASON I CAN'T GET A JOB IS BECAUSE OF MY BACKGROUND CHECKS
HOLY SHIT
wut
could be
if so, how would you fix that?
FFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUU
tell them to look up my social and birthday
its not like YOU've been to jail
isntad of my name
no
but
Sr. and Jr. are one letter off
yeah
clerical workers are bored as fuck
what else could be on your background check that would make you unhirable?
-nothing-
I have 2 speeding tickets.
no
deviant!
I have 1 speeding ticket.
whelp, there it is
lol
1 moving violation
and 1 taillight out whatever
allr esolved
ALL OF THEM
interesting
yeah
my daaaaad however..
i'd make sure they just check you
Upside down on his credit registered sex offender history of violence adn alcohol abuse, etc. etc.
Maybe it's the experience?
your dad has no reflection on you, wether he is a good reference or a bad reference
Did you ask what they meant?
yeah but if people see Anthony Humphreys
I did
so did the boss guy
they can't disclose
sounds about right
well I applied for a job in a supermarket during uni.. I wasn't qualified they said
...
i'd make them check the social for future
>.>
@_@
wut
lol
lol for this job because I had a pulse I was overqualified
that being said
time to preemptively quit
that plane is so chunky it makes me laugh
oh shhhhhit hold on
he just said he'd see me at 3
That plane is no joke though
4x 20mm
Top speed 660km/h
yummy
Even Honuraburr herricoptur
lol uhhh
so they checked the birthday
whatever happened, whenever it happened, I was 11 years old
so yeah
lol'
so they got you and your dad mixed up?
yup
as always
I also got denied a credit card from Discover because I was overdue on payments when I was 8 apparently
so ya know
that happened
Change your name
o_O
To Anthony Humfreys
Bam
fixed
pft
as if people don't have issues enough with that thing
Humphrey / Humphries / Humphreys??
send in another application under a different name :P
Anthony Jumphriees
Anthony Hump
get rid of the freeze
or just make it Humpfreeze
lol
Anthony Coolthrust
lol
Antony Youcantrustme
you can't rust him?
Anthony Stainlesssteel
lol
Anthony Metal
So metal
wow
\m/
\,,/ rather
brb gonna go return things
...
ok someone just asked me to build them a website.
for how much?
don't know
someone was like "who can build a website at an affordable price that wants a job?"
charge them a BILLION dorrahs
I can html code and css buuuut...
i imagine they want a wordpress site
1 dorrah is 1000 dollars
oh good god
lol
it may have been 900
i forget
it was a thing at one point
sure it's not 9000?
i think it was 1 million dollars is 9 million dorrahs
alex held something ransom, and i gave her dorrahs for it
aka a napkin with my drawing of a dorrah note for 90000000 dorrahs
or something close to that
lol
back from lunch
what kind of website did they want you to build tony?
I'm guessing wordpress
but what is the website's purpose?
Finding out.
FFFFFFFFFFFFFUCK ME RUNNING
THE LINKS DON'T WORK TO MY PORTFOLIO
AHHH
oh boy
tony you have the best reactions
lol he really does
normal person: "derp my links are broken"
tony: "GUWAAHHHH FUCK ME RUNNING THE LINKS ARE BROKEN!!!"
how did you hear my guwah from all the way over there
it's the bug I installed on your phone
ehhh
how else am I to complete my sound bites?
So I guess you could say.
NO
STOP
B)
I SEE A PUN
You're keeping an eye on me.
YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!
well really it'd be more of an ear
I like puns that autocomplete themselves.
My pun software is THAT up-to-date
I actually have a pun ready for Crime some day
but the oportunity hasn't come to use it yet
lol
i want to crime
fucking internets
instead of playing fun things with friends i'm looking at what skyrim immersion mods to install so i don't get bored :(
you need to write a distributive cell phone network tethering based mobile hotspot
that sounds
umm
nope
harness all of the 3g from every phone in your house!
i'd just steal my mom's
it'd be 10 times faster than this shit
you'd need more than 2 phones
and she has unlimited data
she's the only one
:F
Brandon bugs me.
the goal is parallel = speed
sure you'd get crazy overage charges
but INTERNET
lol
I guess you could say that Brandon...
B)
Called the pun.
*sigh*
YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!
no
today feels like friday
if you remove one 'o' that redirects to someone's youtube
and their channel seems really weird
daily uploads of wat
lol
my grandparents say now that they're retired every day feels like friday
sounds great
wat
adding an o goes to zombocom
no way
lol
how the hell does that even work
no is apparently a magical word on the internet
apparently
now i'm listening to zombocom
:F
lollololol
lol um
Nao
hi
the youtube video
she thinks she's a prophet
lol
I didn't actually play any since I'm at work
I am a prophet
Go on
ask
lol
what did I have for breakfast
Ian, what is andrew wearing right now?
I predict the future
not the present
Ian, what will I eat for dinner?
what mod will i install first for skyrim?
Food
today
mmm.... touche
Ian, what color shirt will I wear tomorrow?
Andrew: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/9557
yes anthony, go there
(the prophet is a bit high)
lol
Shh
Fixed
Also
I apparently need Skyrim
Brandon, whichever shirt is easiest, the color matters not
Anthony: You do
i want multiplayer skyrim that isnt 15 bucks a month
Ian: you didnt answer the question
I did too
nope
I specifically asked which color
THE LORD HAS SPOKEN
                                       ^
brandon: my guess, gray
that arrow doesnt point to anything
lol
on linux at least
it does for me lol
it points to your comment, right before the lord has spoken
had to get around it
lol
the ubuntu skype positiones messages differently lol
Ian: When will the next major catastrophe happen?
define major
at least 100 dead
real people
humans
i'd say world war 3
i want a date
he is the prohpet!
too bad, i gave you an event
lol
It will occur
hey, even prophets need help sometimes
100 people could die from a plane crash
doesnt take a world war
oh
it does
lol
November 14th, 
Will be the next great disaster
I am going to set a calendar reminder
Do it
if it comes true, I may have to report you to the police
Prophets can't be charged
lol
hahaha
i could totally see that popping up in skype
"sec, police outside"
"FUCK YOU BRANDON"
"I DIDNT DO IT"
"DON'T BLAME THE MESSANGER"
xD
"YOU'LL NEVER TAKE ME ALIVE COPPERS"
added to my google calendar
Okay
you will see
lol
it's a monday
Yes
ahahaha
god i hate mondays
i'm so going to make a worldwide disaster occur on a monday
just to show everyone how much i hate mondays
"the moon is going to collide with Earth. no work today!"
november 14th  sounds like a good date
i've got it!
i'm going to steal the moon!
been done already
I'll steal the sun!
I'll steal your son
sometimes I feel like this chat is just a more advanced form of clever bot with multiple personalities
He's found me out! get him boys!
(the boys are in kansas, give them 5-6 business days)
do major holidays count as business days?
no
Assuming banking days
no
they do not
what major holidays are we having in the next 5-6 days?
none
Nao day, Deco day, Holly day, Day day
there may be 10-12 more holidays in the next 5-6 business days
they may take some time to get there in that case
better start running
I dont like running
Better begin driving sometime next week
that works too
i like running
and swimming
i like swimming
mountain biking anyone?
i like mountain hiking
we should go on a hiking/camping trip
somewhere with trees
and nice air
i'm down
Oh
Central California?
You guys have tents?
yes
If we went to the central/coastal area the climate would be green and nice
Or
Alpine
Apline climate would be cool
I'll fly down to my parents pick up my tent and join you guys
Do it
all in all expected cost euro
yup
haha
lol lemme verify xD
I bet Los Padres would be nice
backpacking seems like it'd be fun
Great Basin could be nice too
AMS-Vegas 770euro's
round trip, 2 weeks
not bad actually
Yeah
I thought it would be a lot more
it would be cheaper to get a tent there xD
lol
lol renting a tent is easy
I have several tents
lol
that too
I have a very, very large tent
like
I just realized, I dont think a single person in this office has a mouse
two of my old room in reno, big
wut
really?
yeah
how the hell
lol
cmd
or terminal
lol
we're all on laptops, and most peole either use the laptop touch pad or an external usb touch pad
oh
lame
do everything by command line
well we spend most of our time in a terminal
so yeah, not much mouse usage for that
true
weird
external touch pad huh?
back
lol external touchpad?
that's new
a dog just very methodically walked in here and sniffed down every row of computers looking for something
>.>
like
company dog?
or just random dog
the dog belongs to someone from the other company that works on this floor
it looks like scooby
lol
lol
I find it difficult to start writing this website without a usb keyboard/mouse
just use the ghost mouse and make clicky sounds
I had the Scooby deliver the ghost mouse to your computer.
sometimes I instinctively reach for my mouse
so aircraft
much money
need kills
wow
many tank as well
maybe i'll have better internet and be able to do that :P
you could always just chain a ton of ethernet cables all the way to reno
at that point the internet would be slower than it is here because the electrons took so long to get from one place to the other
lol i dont think that would be a big problem
hey man, those things only go the speed of light
the bigger problem would be laying down however many miles of ethernet cable
yes
that would be a nusiance
without random people unconnecting or breaking them
i'd make it all underground
maybe a giant drone network to relay the wifi connection
that would be cool
Looks like tier I russia time
with recharging motherdrones that fly up, charge a few drones, then dock back at the ground to recharge itself
70 battles?
wow
yeah
hard to get that plane
of course, wind would ruin that
but the kills is doable
for both tanks and planes, doable
unless you went to space
i want to space
and made a satellite network
lol
but that's already been done
solution to bad internet: make satellite
but they DID make satellites!
overkill?
no
and you still have slow internet
unless i used the satellite to steal the NSA's internet
wouldnt that be a breach of privacy though?
i shouldnt do that to them
I need a game suggestion
Anyone got one?
minecraft
Are you on?
no
lol
I mean a new game
lol
i played on that server bob found for a bit
hmmm
new game
Brandon
h1z1 when it comes out
I have been playing on that server too
you should come work with me
o rly
are you in rikoto?
Yes
However Bob gave me my own land grant
what are you working on?
I want to build a plantation, and factories to make $$$
Got any cool idears?
for a plantation or for a game?
Either
lol
i want to play h1z1
other than that, no new/upcoming games really appeal to me
minecraft authentication servers down for maintance
I like sandbox games
I want a new good sandbox game
As do I
Starmade looks okay
And I've played a fair amount
but
its not minecraft
starmade just seems boring
like, it doesnt have much to do
Exactly
build a big ship, then.... nothing
Just
Empty space
and disk planets
Yeah
thats
weird
SPORE is on steam
But
I'm not going to buy that again
I have SPORE. on disk. with a used key. by me. but it wont let me reinstall it
That game could have been great
because I used the key
and origin sucks balls
Its on steam
yeah but origin has my original info
I don't even have origin installed
but wont let me access it
ahhhh
it knows I played it, but wont let me reinstall it
Do you have Rust?
no
Its "okay"
I've heard mixed reviews about Rust
Arent they completely rewriting it?
Yeah
slowly
lol
lol
Its "fun"
untill you die
and lose everything
That you worked for
for three hours
lol
"Oh, look I made an M4"
-arrowed to head by n00b
Dead
haha
What do you think about h1z1?
let me look at it
It's like DayZ but on the PS2 engine
With base building and stuff
Hmmm
might not be bad then
yeah
Is it voxel?
Like editable terrain?
apparently you will be able to configure servers to be PvE, PvP, etc
not terrain
Booo
but you can build kinda like rust i think
Some sort of base building
I like my fully editable worlds
I think thats why minecraft is so great
you can change anything
yeah
mc has terrible pvp mechanics though
It has terrible mechanics
period
h1z1 is based on actual world geometry, which is cool
if it doesn't just become a giant deathmatch and people actually build bases it'd be very fun
You know it will turn into death match
it always does
well theres always pve servers
or roleplay servers
I want native Kerbal multiplayer
lol
dude awesome
they're about to update the appearance of the LoL maps
You play LoL? lol
I do.
starmade no longer has disc planets
they are hexagonal but in 3d (not sure what that is called)
hexahexagonal!
they also have a new weapons system
which seems cool
hex^2
hexacohedron?
something like that
yohexdawg
lol
games to play: modded skyrim
dishonored
but i already played skyrim
war thunder
but modded is SO much better
like
I played war thunder for an hour and a half
its like sandboxing your own game, with skyrim and the mods as building blocks
also
but
i get better internets soon
like
within a few days soon
yayy
woo
how much better?
25mb down
nice
not sure on the up
but yeah
basic comcast
up doesnt matter much for playing games
yeah
so you should be good
up matters more for sharing things via kerbal multiplayer
lol
nah
you hardly share any data
true, images and a few 1's or 0's
which then goes to lots of 1s and 0s
I saw a 2 once
lol
position/velocity/orientation, screenshots rarely, maybe ship data
lol
unfortunately not enough to make it so you can actually see them without landing
there really needs to be a workaround for that
landing is hard
im guessing the client handles stuff like damage, so that would also be sent
this all sums up to a few bytes per packet anyways
lol
lol
yeah
brb
well, i was planning on starting a youtube series where i upload 4k videos of bananas
so that's probably out
bbl dinner
theres your 4k banana
so the more I learn about angularjs, the more I realize I have no practical use for it
which makes me sad
whyfor it has no use?
it doesnt have no use, but I don't need to use it for its main use
which is two way data binding
like doing stuff then interacting with a database based on that stuff
gotcha
you could probably use it for a web application of that game you wanted to make
it could be used for some stuff, but not the actual game
we should play some gmod mods
I don't haz that game
oh yay, I got partials working with angular
you still work?
at work* ?
no
oh, then what are you working on?
A portfolio website/app
very slowly
I'm still deciding how to structure my folders
lol
And whether I should create the git repo locally or on the web server
Web server would be easier but there's no reason to put it on the server really
Local would mean I'd either have to pull from the server for every test or set up grunt on my vm to test locally
which is a lot of work...
wait
git repo
wait
could you make a website display something from a remote site?
?
Maybe I don't understand.
github
version control
ah
that way I can work on this while at work or at home
ahah
I'm hosting the actual site on the unr cse servers
hahah
that's intended use of that server, actually
cse.unr.edu/~worl/
that's the original site I was making before I got bored of it
orite
jeeze, the other Updater people in new york are still working on refactoring
it's past midnight there
busy busy
gotta meet them deadlines
lol
they decided to completely restructure their site architecture
rather, the expert on angularjs they hired told them to
good lord
interesting
it's really a good call but kind of a big task and nothing else can be done in the mean time
well that's only a bad thing if you don't get paid in the meantime lol
it's really crazy how many different technologies are used to make that site

that's just SOME of the different packages needed to develope/test/run the site
wow
oh my god
why does my html keep breaking
the only error message I get is "weird error"
useful
GRR
this canker sore is going to murder me
yay now I can edit files locally, send them to git, then run a shell script on the remote server to automatically clone the latest version of the website
efficient use of time while no other work can be done? check
you're on your way to the top young man
Nice.
lol
I've spent like 10 hours working on this today in total
and so far I have the groundwork partially made to start making my folders/blank files
so not particularly efficient
Groundwork is very important though
yeah but now I'm trying to figure out this autohotkey script that supposedly allows you to maximize windows to quadrants of your screen/move windows between multiple screens
o.o
dat workspace
dude
Working tomorrow with nothing but a laptop with 1600x900 resolution and no external mouse or keyboard will be hard
these hotkeys are awesome lol
I couldn't get WindowPadX to work but it didnt seem to add any amazing functionality anyways
actually it adds some cool stuff but oh well
and now it is bed time
g'night
nite
well that's annoying... I can't put my computer to sleep or hibernation for some reason
wakes itself up within 30 seconds of going to sleep
>_>
holy shit what is with people cancelling their morning interviews
>interview for Ford bro at 8am
>get call: scratch that, make it 9am
>moresleep.jpg
>interview today for BullFish Media at 10am
>8:40 I get email that says to reschedule Monday
These people are robbing me of sleep
sleeeep
And he's gone
must be sleeeeping
Hope so lol, I wouldn't sleep well with that many interviews
wat
my first discussion for this women's studies class is literally about a strong independant black woman who dont need no man
o_O
reminds me of something... not this though
that gif in the top comment always makes me feel strange
indeed
I'd be screaming like a girl
I'd be dead from a broken neck after falling off that ladder
actually I'd have shot that spider
*though I have one of those electric zappers. It would concern me how something so big got in my room
hahaha
with an arrow or nail gun or something
while covered head to toe as securely as possible
with a clear escape route and chemical weapons
hahaha *clear an escape route <----this
it's hard to navigate while in a panic, gotta be prepared!
If it doesn't make any sudden moves I'll trap it and throw it out.
that would involve getting near it
Ment never meant to kill, just to maim or seriously injure
haha
I did sleep
what I wanted to be a nap
turned into a 3 hour nap :/
lol
nao
that side navigation thing is pretty slick
needs a central way to add new links, but is otherwise cool
oho! I have routing working on my new website design :D
I wish i understood these terms :<
header and footer are in separate files which get included in to main by angular
about is a view controlled by routing
duuuuuude
going to http://www.cse.unr.edu/~worl/portfolio-website/index.html#/projects changes the view
without reloading the page entirely
so header/footer remain, but now it shows the projects page
in the view div
...is it worth it for me to have a github?
do you work on programming projects involving multiple people or work on the same project from multiple computers?
nope!
afk
<<< you should listen to the german version of "won't say i'm in love" from hercules
seriously
back
yeah, if you don't do software collaboration, then there is no need to have a github account
okey doke
that is what imgur is like for me
constantly
BUT
fellas
On june 11th, i will have 25mb/s down!!!
wooo
yayyyy
holy jesus
cubehamster is definitely back into mc
tanks and walkers and stuff
yeah
that thing is awesome
animation :D
some basic styling + sticky footer :D
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
ok what
By installing my ftp server
rather
trying and failing to
I can no longer upload images to my website
because the directories aren't writeable
fucking hell
upload via ftp?
can't
ftp doesn't work
no, im asking if thats what doesnt have permission
uploading files in Wordpresses media library
"Unable to create directory wp-content/uploads//06. Is its parent directory writable by the server?"
ok
I really can't wait until I finish my new site..
well maybe i can
because I dont' know how to set up a FTP server properly
you can also just copy files by ssh
that's what I'm doing for my site right now because I am too lazy to figure out why I can't establish a ftp connection to their server
how do you do that...
well wait
don't explalin anything because I don't even know what directory to upload this to
or where it will display
scp <local/file> <user@somewhere.com:remote/path>
if moving a folder, do
skype is stupid
sec
scp -r <local/folder/> <user@somewhere.com:remote/path>
wordpress is so ....freaking......freaky
permission denied
i apparently don't know my own password
screw it
top priority is making my website
lol
scp
so bork
what's wrong with scp?
lol I always seem to make one tiny mistake when using it
lol
Which results in a sloppy mess
lol
My only complaint was having to put in my remote password every time, but I just set up my ssh key to avoid that
You know what I mean
Yeah
Keys are bueno
indeed
Want to minecraft?
Or war thunder
or some game
perhaps in like 30 minutes maybe
I have a weird css bug
Whats up with it
?
click between about and projects
well thats fun
the slide should be only visible in the middle different color part
and not be derpy
should just be a smooth slide out of the old and in with the new
Its like a typewriter
lol
I'm digging through your page
I tried to use sudo chmod on the remote server earlier
it told me I wasnt on the sudo people list and that I would get automatically reported for having tried to sudo
lol
Sudo always does that
If you aren't on the list it will tell you that
lol
lol
I don't know where its reported to
I should find out
(where the report is stored, that is)
grrr I almost have it working
except it is now vertically challenged
I think it is impossible to get this to animate how I want only using css x_x
meh
i went for the easier fade animation instead
Brandon
Mumble?
you on the server?
yes
k gimme a sec
link to server wiki deco?
uhh
one sec
Bazaam
Can't take that lag
lol
gotta take a break
I hate breaking my shit.
What you break?
ftp server and my website
oh again?
haha
it happens, that's why rewriting things makes you a better programmer. learn from mistakes
^
I make tons of mistakes
me 3
best way to learn really
lol
unless you missed something really stupid
like a ;
then your life sucks
Cause that's always the worst
the only time learning from mistakes isnt okay is if you're in a championship situation or a life or death situation
the first one ends in a loss, the second involves loss of life
ded
you don't face too many of those situations though
so i think we're good
lol
now time to farm some kills with planes
lol
Is your internet good enough?
are you on mc deco?
he is on WT
you should join us
i think he's afk at the moment though
i'm gonna do t1 battles for kills
not AFK
Call?
Ian
I'm gonna BS my women's studies discussion thingy
womens study IS bs
Ian
yeah
woo
8 kills
nothing but Boofallo
...
After I rented this textbook for $40, he decides to just post the chapter readings online for free
gg
that sucks
ughh I hate tanks
1 battle in
Rage quit
lawl great
hai there
i play wt in a second if peeps want to join
I had to rage quit WT
lol
Tanks
so anger
wow
i just watched a video on tank ammos in WT, learned quite a bit about how they work
wobsite question for anyone
form type "email" doesn't register as a valid input for some reason
Only useful rounds in War Thunder are APCR and HEAT
Not really
the only useless rounds are shrapnel and HE
they're for unarmored targets
but the other rounds each have their use
and php fails again
goody
yeah php no work
just went 11-0 with three ground kills in a LaGG 3-11
woo
AP: I try to only shoot from a bazillion miles out
WAITAMINUTE
DOTA2 WAS MADE BY VALVE
WHAAAAT
._.
maybe I should switch over from league...
APCR and HEAT on the only things I need
lol
So I don't have to really worry about over penetration
DOTA 2 is supposed to be really good
like
better than league but less popular because fanboys
lol
i hear the learning curve is ridiculously steep
seems that way
i watch it on twitch when im bored sometimes
just went 12-2 (13 if you count friendly fire, dude killed me, i got him back) with 9 kills in the 3-11
and that got me my 70 aircraft
woo
Another thing is that apparently Dota is a bit more toxic community wise :<
LoL and Dota are both cancer communities
Hence the best strategy is to ignore everyone and spam #YOLO
I see the cancer has infected you
We must operate this instant
lol
lol
hi
do you want help with your website woes tony?
well i just found out that the html needs to reference an external .php file
so i'm progressing
yeah i'd like help
probably won't be able to swing anything tonight though
I'll be busyish tomorrow
bbqing with john/grandma tomorrow
lol bbqing tonight
we just went out looking at guns earlier today
lol
nice
plan on getting one?
Yeah
some time before going back to reno
My parents also want guns for at home too
in case of zombie apocalypse?
of course
makes sense
what kind of guns you looking at?
We were looking mostly at glocks and berettas
9mm
ah, handguns
9mm are nice
I'm partial to a good short 40 though
Well something for concealed carry would be nice
so, something slim
my dad's service pistol (the one he can carry while off duty) is really nice
what kind is it?
that's the short 40
i forget the make
probably smith and wesson
since i think that's what the chp uses
I've been wanting a Mosin Nagant for shooting
Smith and Wesson 4006 TSW. .40 cal
thats a nice looking pistol
it is very nice
at 30m out I put 5 rounds within 2 inches of each other, my dad and I were having a contest
I was looking at a beretta similar to this one: http://img413.imageshack.us/img413/962/beretta92fs01small.jpg
It's aluminum though, heavier than I'd like
yeah i was just gonna say those are pretty heavy duty guns lol
just get a luger
lol yeah
let me just go back in time and kill a nazi and take his luger
they have some that are like 99% the same, but with modern functionality at the gun shop near my house here
and at scheels in reno
they look like the gun of my dreams
lol
so cool
I like the glock but I'd kind of like to have a physical safety
glocks are dangerous
lol
my brother carries a modified glock
modified how
I'm not sure
I know he changed the sights
dunno what else
oh gotcha
i was thinking you meant like a full auto mod
and was like
umm
wow
lol
lol
how expensive are you looking?
around $600 ish
well, right above that (600 to 800) is an HK USP 9mm
those things are really nice
I literally just googled usp
lol
haha
yeah
they're light
looks nice too
yep
you can feel like a spy
lol
lol
I wanted to see if the gun store we were at had an FN five-seven
the usp compact 9mm is nice, but compacts have some serious recoil in the vertical direction
it didnt :(
no sam fisher for me
haha
the five-seven is cool
and expensive
with expensive ammo
lol
yep
but sooo sexy
a Five-Seven
y u ever buy that
because sexy
cuz its COOL
lol
It is cool
But
not practical
yeah :(
Honestly, for a handgun, I'd like a long barreled Luger
Preferably the 9mm varient
i like lugers
they're awesome looking
lol p90
haha
it says personal defense weapon
so
there you go
my dream pistol is the Mauser c96
Would be so so so so cool to have
i'm sorry, did someone say han solo?
lol they based his gun on that yes
yeahhhh they aren't cheap
And that's a red 9 varient
which sucks
You want the ones that fire the 7.63x25mm
Which are litterally shortened rifle bullets
you want a Makarov now?
now
no
never
lol
cheap russian pistol
oh
that didnt link to the russian military one
it was 1000 bucks
for a 200 dollar gun
lol
I have a Mosin Nagant
Its a great rifle
i know
lucky bastard
those things are so pretty
You can pick them up for under $200, although heavy cleaning and light repair will be required
Then they are great.
yeah
but the cleaning and repair are the hard part
wow
10lb trigger on the fn 49
double action only too
that's pretty safe if you don't want to accidentally pull it lol
and also pretty damn hard to pull the trigger on
My gun only took 2 hours to fully restore to working order
that SW my dad owns has a 6lb double action trigger, followed by 2lb single
after that first shot getting the rest to go is really easy
and kinda fun
you can empty a clip in like 10 seconds and be really accurate
can you manually pull the hammer back for the first shot?
it is back by default when you load the pistol
it's a service revolver
so it's for active use
like
load and shoot, repeat
double action only occurs if you hit the safety after loading
well
any time you hit the safety
yeah
if you decock it
yeah
and no, you can't manually pull it back, unless you chamber the round manually
like i said, it's the short variety, aka the compact, and most compacts get rid of spurred hammers
it does have a manual safety though
I like the glock, I'd just like to have a manual safety
yeah
i was also gonna say, my dad's gun is like 2lbs unloaded
and like 2.4 loaded or something crazy like that
.40's are heavy
so is the magazine
lol
get a type 77
chinese gun
VERY reliable
(sarcasmark)
Chinese guns suck
lololol
indeed they do
lol
Also
ain't nobody got time for 70 tank kills
i have 14
from three matches
go t1 russia with the t50 as your highest tank, run around with t50, profit
also a good way to get those battles out of the way
some tank matches are really quick
i saw a boston flying earlier today (the one you get for completing the three tasks) i immediately took my ishak down and showed him my rockets
That's the thing
the Boston sucks
yes
but
it is a collector's item
and 300k is what i'm after anyway
I'd rather have a Po-2
lol
me too
but
Or an A-26 Invader
that thing is amazing
it looks awesome too
back when historical battles were a thing, a guy recorded 52 ground kills with an invader
30 or so were with his tailgunner
lol
impressive
We should fight
with nothing
but
....
.......
.......
Swordfishes
swordfishes
why
Cause they are the worst plane in the game
debatable
i've gotten kills in a swordfish before
i've never gotten a kill in that japanese PoS with no front guns
But, the B5N2 is actually an effective dive bomber
The swordfish actually sucks at ground attack AND air attack
well, if gaijin gave a use to seaplanes other than the inability to land, then it would be okay
Swordfish has wheels....?
Its not a seaplane
i was thinking of the kingfisher
oops
lol
still
it has a forward facing 7.7
and a turret
Swordfish has the same guns
but slower
and is a biplane
no i know
that's what i mean
the swordfish is better than the kingfisher
it can land
and turn faster
haha
ok, custom battle, kingfisher vs swordfish, go
The real loser
is losing
I invited you
that was interesting
I am typing to you in in game chat
saw that
off to dinner, bbl
ok
should i play minecraft, watch dogs, or something else?
minedogs
Do watch dogs
and tell me if its worth buying
I'm about 80% done with the game
The main story, at least
Maybe more like 75%
Oh?
Is it worth buying?
Well, I got it for free. I don't think I'd buy it at full price
ahh
It's fairly fun, very similar to GTA, but different kind of story
The main story actually has quite a bit of length to it
my buddy jared said it's really good on console
he has it for ps4
PC master race
that's essentially what i said
both he and my brother disagree
it's a fine game but $60 is just a bit much
not sure why
60 bucks isnt really worth any game imo
at least, not as an outright purchase
i'll spend 60 bucks on a game's content if i like it enough
like wt
but i'd need money to spend it
so lol
what minecraft have you been playing?
gamerhaus.net forums
i dont remember the ip
its a gh thing?
no
bob found a server
oh gotcha
aw, getting reset in a month?
lame
only the resource world
not the build world
what's the difference?
creative vs survival?
no
resource world is for resources
mining
OH
trees, etc
no way
that's cool
stuff transfers?
in the other world you can only build in land your town owns
sounds cool
has jobs/mcmmo
exploitable?
yeah, but we arent
gotcha
not as exploitable as chromahills
well once the new internets come i may join
i want to try some shaders
that image you posted was pretty
seus + chroma hills resource pack + enabling parallax in seus = amazing
what's parallax?
stuff like cobblestone gets depth
oh really
that is awesome
so as you walk, you actually see the individual stones of the cobble change perspective
wow
that does sounds like a whole different game
like
skyrim vs modded skyrim
it projects the 3d view (based on bump mapping) onto the 2d block surfaces
very cool
only works with certain texture packs that have bump mapping
also you have to edit the seus files to enable it :F
of course :P
couldnt make it easy lol
it's worth editing the seus stuff anyways
it has CRAZY depth of field
like unplayable amounts
I reduced the DOF effect by like 90%
i installed skyrim redone, which is a HUGE overhaul mod, then had to spend half an hour patching the other content mods like armor and weapons to work with the new system
so worth it though
depth of field is annoying in general
it looks nice as a small background feature
only if it's REALLY light
yeah
there's a mod called dynavision for skyrim that does DOF, by default it only does a tiny bit
the author is a good LPer
first lp i've watched where the guy is both good at the game and programming for the game
well, zipkrowd kinda matches that description
and tango
and seth bling
and guude
oh and i forgot to mention he's nice to listen to, and he speaks in a coherent manner
lol
if you include computer craft as programming for the game
kinda
but yeah
he's just overall really fun to watch
welp. just finished act 4 of watch dogs
out of 5 acts
my character is having a bad couple of years
lol
if nobody else is using it, this internet can handle streaming spotify and playing wt
maybe it could handle mumble and wt
prbably not skype though
WERRR THUNDERRRR
want to play?
could try mumble/skype as well
We could
hmmm
thunder of war mumble?
Andrew?
sec
just crashed
kk
in the thunder of war now
someone pick a random number. it will decide how I finish this watch dogs storyline
welp, 18 meant I let the guy live. But I shot a box and apparntly it was full of explosives
he died
I only meant to scare him
oh well
guise, you doing stuff on the MaM server?
kinda been wanting to get into vanilla again
there's a few people active on the server bob found
I'm not on at the moment
are we doing rikolto or docs?
rikoto
good for me :D
deco has an outpost though
mornong dogetors
I thinik my internets are broken>.>
Hallo Derktors
never get a p90
ever
wait Rikolto?
isn't that the old server?
Rikoto, it's just the name bob likes to use for his town
lol
Also
For home defense
I'd probably do a shotgun
lol I want to get a concealed carry permit after I graduate
May as well get a pistol now so I can get good with it by then
honorabru decosun
you are playing the thunders, yes?
I am on mumble and warring thunders if you would like to join me
if you get a pistol
and want to practice
I suggest getting an airsoft equivalent
it'll be cheaper in the long run what with ammo
that won't be very similar to firing a real gun with real ammo though
same weight, shape, etc.
no but on the draw and the aim you'll be fine
there is a huge difference in recoil and projectile weight/velocity/shape
Good for practicing drawing, loading, arming, and firing.
yeah except you won't aim or fire it the same as a real gun
Eh, it's what I'm gonna do.
Only difference being the weight and recoil but those scale up enough.
And I can practice in my backyard if need be.
I dunno, I feel like that could form muscle memory that won't work for the real gun
I was inspired by this: http://blog.cheaperthandirt.com/airsoft-practice-for-maintaining-shooting-skills/
if that helps
Failing that..
Keep in mind it's only good for new guns and for SOME new guns
If there's even a thought that it could damage it, don't dry fire.
Although actually you know who'd be able to tell you? Your bro.
Yeah, we've discussed it a bit
Ok I'm bloody lost with this wobsite thing.
Does php go in a php doc AND html?
php, like css, can be in its own file or in an html file
though it is best to put it in its own file
ahah
does each little section need to be wrapped in <?php ?> ?
or just the entirety of the doc?
actually i'm not sure if php can go directly in html
I thought it could, but I'm not 100% sure on that
Even these tutorials are confusing.
anything which is php must be inside the <?php ?>
ok, will there be multiple <?php?> (appropriate symbol) things, or just one encompassing all like the <html> tag?
if it is just php inbetween the <?php and the ?> then you're good
ok
php can go in html
still not recommended though
buh
what are you using php for anyways?
contact form
...did the logic packs in ECM work like php?
it's kinda familiar
I HATE PHP
clicking submit just shows the php code
logic packs were just binary logic, which is present in all programming languages
ah
well php is dumb
lol
that's the general consensus
you could show me your code and I could give help/feedback if you want
plz
decosine
i r mumble
i r bored
war thunder?
maybe
yes
mumble?
sure
sec
still playing war thunder?
Yes
Ian

Ian

time for bed
hai
myes?
?
oh damn
can't tell if i want titanfall
or all the other games...
i want all the mass effect
titanfall has very little replay value
not even worth it at half off imo
I bought crysis 3 for $10
lol
And am reminded why I hate origin
download the installer, open it, and it INSTANTLY restarts my computer without notifying me
._.
ahah
well my interview was today
was
he had a family emergency
yesterday
told me today
at 11:37
it wasn't until I guessed his company's wifi password and checked my mail at 12:30 that I found out.
I was there at 11:30 -__
13.7 miels from the house
wow
what was the wifi password? lol
the company's name is "bullfish media"
one guess!
bullfishmedia
bullfish1234
bullfish
lol
lol
it was weird
until i typed out bullfish fully I couldn't even connect, so there was a minimum character req
I thought, "that's too perfect to pass up"
sure enough
mail: anthony, can't make it
*RAGE*
oh well
whaaat
Mass Effect Trilogy for $14
SOLD
unable to process payment options
what
*sigh*
trying to login to origin
account credentials are expired
lol
redirects
you successfully buy anything?
yeah
every time i try to reset password
they're experiencing technical difficulties
by the way
E3 is on twitch
is there some sort of e3 schedule?
uhhh
oh nvm found it
ubisoft at 3
that's gonna be interesting
Hopefully it'll have stuff about The Division
Sony is at 6
Probably gonna have a bunch of H1Z1 stuff
is that sale still going? it shows everything full price for me
yes
ah i see
you have to add it to cart first
until the 16th
it'll take a lot of patience
I want the division
like
i think that's the #1 game i'm waiting for other than h1z1
h1z1 is going in to early access within like 2-3 weeks
and i only want that because i can say it like frankie with the zed
lol
ooh
i wonder if it'll be a good early access
i'm tired of alphas
frankie is streaming something today at 4pm
on twitch
I think it may be h1z1
cool
he cant say what it is due to an NDA
too bad this internet can't handle it :F
but h1z1 did a big announcement thing today, so an NDA on that would have been lifted
yeah
maybe the division?
the division is far from being released still lol
yeah but maybe they have a demo or something they sent him
OH
no i bet its the new battlefield thing
EA loves NDA's
Hardline?
lol
yeah
isnt that just an expansion for bf4?
no, it's totally separate
what is it?
they're pulling in some other dev too
It's Payday 2: Battlefield
^
yep
that sounds.... interesting
frankie already did a hardline video though
so
yeah, discussing the project, not playing it
ok i want to design my website
oh, if you couldnt tell I didnt actually watch it :p
but i want to play mass effect and tombraider now
i know jack frags and frankie were contacted to get their input on what would make it better
mass effect: yes
tomb raider: once
lol
I still hope he plays h1z1 on his stream
had literally no replay value for me]
Tombraider for $5
but
yes
it was fun
tomb raider was a really pretty looking game
yeah
and had a fun story
especially her hair
they have a 2nd one
lol
the 2nd one is just a remastered first one isnt it?
nope
she's having flashbacks and going to therapy over the events of 1
in 2 she's growing more as a treasure hunter
interesting
i may have to play it then
from what i heard it was the first one but with some added stuff
xbone had a trailer
but i guess that was just full of shit lol
i read some article about it, obviously they had an opinion that skewed the presentation of the game
Rise of the Tomb Raider?
yus
oh
that isnt actually available though is it?
that's not what i was thinking of
that was announced at e3 like a few hours ago
it was like tomb raider: unleashed or something
well then
now i'm excited
lol
LOL
er
lol*
lmao
I love when you do that tony
caps lock happens sometimes
yeah but it's just to imagine you LOLing
lol god
"now I'm excited"
"BAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH"
no
no I am politely chuckling.
makes you sound like an asian person or a middle aged woman
lol
lol
ROFLMAO XDDDDDDD
thats definitely asian
oh internet
so internet, wow
middle aged women arent that experienced at acronyms
"I heard your uncle died LOL (lots of love)"
lol
ok if not Christopher Walken someone made me hear Starfire when reading Doge
Such Party, much fun, wow!
wow
yeah
i can see both of those
that is quite funny
crysis 2 is such a long game. I only played through about half of it. I dont feel like redoing all of that plus the second half just to learn the story before playing 3
I wonder if it has sparknotes
lol
watch someone play it on youtube
^
I tried, the guy randomly stopped like 5 or 6 episodes in
so then I found a "movie" version with cut scenes and important parts of gameplay only
it is 2.5 hours long though
lol
sounds like a movie
lol
I dont know why, but I just can NOT get through crysis 2
I've tried to play it 3 times
its like any other fps, you get bored of holding down the left mouse button or right trigger after a while
at least that's what happens to me
it's a great game with a better story than most FPS's
I've played through worse
yes
but
still an fps
I played through GoW 2 in an afternoon
god of war was weird
i never got into it
gears of war
lol
oh
i really never got into that
seemed weird
yeah me neither
it was
it's also third person
which at the time i scoffed at
it had a good camera though
because i was a mw2 junkie
lol
come to think of it, that was probably the first game i specifically tried to exploit
that's why it was so fun
the new ones arent nearly as exploitable
wow you werent kidding about payday: battlefield
lol
Duffel bags!
i dont even understand the thought process behind that
Oh my jesus.
so the shooters of the massacre yesterda
They dress up as The Joker and Harley Quinn (used to) and went to fremont street to panhandle
They lived on Bruce Street
INCOMING CONSPIRITARDS
im batman
lol
lol
EAT. THE. FUCK. ING. CHIP.
i got the bearcat :P
he's streaming hardline :(
i dont see why this isnt just a battlefield 4 game mode dlc
lol
ooookay so I might be getting some contract work
hey guyz
hai
how goes it fellow doctor?
Interestingly...
My interview didn't show up
family emergency
Oh wow
I found out by breaking into his wifi and reading my email
"breaking in” aka using the guest account?
aka guessing the password
bullfish media
their wifi password
"bullfish"
wow
such surprise
you should have tried to break into the router
and changed it
to
like
HitlerStalinSatan
pft
but... that's my wifi password
i broke more things
what did you break?
i'm trying to use...http://masonry.desandro.com/#getting-started
er
annnd
I really don't know how to tie it in
you install it via bower?
wait fixed
i did not
also Destiny is on twitch e3 right now
OH
why is Destiny on PS?
because sony
hm
i forget if destiny was a ps4 only thing or what
actually isnt it all platforms?
It started on XBox
rather
Bungie
I know it is developed on PC
but not releasing on pc :(
-_- shame
oh, destiny is on xbox360/one and ps3/4
idk why it is in the sony panel then
lol
lol that confused me
well maybe it has something to do with that alpha deal of theirs
probably
H1z1?
dont think so
im not sure what this is
oh wait is this that "30fps" game?
character design looks like it
The Order: 1886
yup
you getting sound issues?
yeah
and stuttering
lol
lol that was a slow update
uptake*
..
how cliche
lol
lol
lol loading
yup
so back to your masonry thing
yuh
what part of it isnt working?
images aren't displaying properly
it's breaking out
but is the script at least loading/running?
it seems to be
took me a while to figure out what went where
lol
lol E3 sony: buy our shit before you leave
all you need is that html line
and html in the correct format
but I want options....
container with elements of the same class
what's all that with jafascript and jquery?
optional
you can use html, js, or jquery to create one of those grids
oh wow
yeah, only need to use one
I want it to be like this:
if you're comfortable with js you could do that, or just do it in the html
so that uses another js library, "classie"
in addition to masonry
looks like classie is just a tool for dynamically changing css classes on html elements
@_@
that just means including that js file as well, and using it like in that example
they should make a new dark cloud like this
lol
like Bloodborne?
...oh my god
it was seriously that simple
i hat eme
i love you
i hate me
bloody hell
"why not both" ?
guh
lol
you were doing the js and html both?
yeeaaaaah
dat 420p
lol
this is such a weird awesome tralier
is that Jack Black's voice?
dunno, but I swear I heard Joe Swanson several times voicing the cops on Watch Dogs
lol
you may have
lol there was like no response to when he said "and a grappling hook!"
but really though, grappling hooks are far too rare in games
I'd play grappling hook simulator 
lol
LoZ: Ocarina of Time
haha "hulk smash"
the grappling hook was the best part of tribes vengeance
lol
why do these people try jokes
lol
it lagged and that sounded like "can it do niggles?"
i was like "wut"
lol
this would be cool
ok i can put all options in that little option container in html?
yeah, that option thing is actually JSON (javascript object notation)
so it is pretty much exactly the same as doing it via javascript
huh
what ever became of that space game that was extremely hyped up a while ago? the one with a ton of cool space ships and an infinite procedural universe
i dont remember the name of it
star citizen?
no, older than that
no idea
oh look
sony has a playstation camera
they've had it for a while
since ps3
lol seriously?
yow
morpheus looks cool though
yeah
annnnnnnnnd it seems I'm confined to just html
?
I'dl ike http://codepen.io/desandro/pen/jGJKL to happen
but maybe it's best to just have sliding blocks
you should be able to basically just copy/paste that code and have it work
I actually just referenced it via url
I mean the js on the right side of that page you just linked
does <script src="the external url"></script> not work?
it does, but http://packery.metafizzy.co/packery.pkgd.js is not the same as what is in that right panel
ok
nope
the code on the right shows how to interface that external js library with your html/css
Still not working. I'm not sure if I should be tweaking this stuff.
lol
I made a .js file that I reference but it stilll doesn't quite work
Are you including that external file and the js from http://codepen.io/desandro/pen/jGJKL ?
wait, I need to do both?
yes
oh good god
Think about it
why do you need both?
what is the purpose of each set of js?
I thought that everything in that .js section was contained in packery.metafizzy.com/jifjiejfiajf/jfiejafiejafeaj/ external
and you just had the option to copy/paste or reference it externally
have you looked at http://packery.metafizzy.co/packery.pkgd.js ?
oh wow
no
lol
that file is what does all of the magic
the stuff in that editor window just references that external file
and tells it where in your html file to hook up to
like, where to attach the 'click' event
it does so using css selectors
so, var container = document.querySelector('.packery'); looks for an element in your html/css with the class 'packery'
oh dear
...
it explodes when I put actual images in there
lol
I feel very very very out of my league
that's good
you wont learn anything if you feel comfortable
lol
If you want to screen share/do something in person I'd be down
I can help you understand how to approach something like this to both understand it and implement it
sure, you available now?
finishing dinner, but otherwise yes
just lemme know
k dinner's done
how you want to do this?
screenshare ok?
sure
wait ratchet clank movie
lol yeah
clap louder infidels! ratchet and clank is the best!
lol
ok ready?
yep
destiny is ps4 and xbone
i think it is also on the old consoles as well
what yall up to?
on a skype call with tony
learning to php/html/things?
js/html
nice
i feel dirty, i havent programmed anything this summer
but the internet is so bad
and i only have one screen
program something
i messed around in game maker for a few hours
tried to fix that platform jumping smily face, still failing
i think the GM install I have is derp
he can't move when on platforms
and he should be able to
theres probably something wrong with your code/command sequence
that's what I figured, so i did a separate test based on a tutorial on doing it, followed exactly, and had the same problem
tutorial dude did not
well its unlikely to be an install issue
i just meant a cracked version bug or something, since that popped up a few times when googling bugs
i think we can get the full version free through unr somehow
anyone want to do some crime? i want to see if this internet can handle it
don’t have dat game
i'm down for any game really
i just got raped in a tank and rage quat :F
kv1 spawn campuh
Kv-OP
indeed
i need better ammo belts in my bearcat
not enough fires/wing lasers, plus i need tracers
nope
lol
ground targets belt
hefi?
ap-i
aha
Nothing but AP-I
wooo
any tracers in it?
at all?
aww
lol
oh
i seem to be horrible with 800m convergence
Well one round per 3

Ian
Ian
mumble then?
Ian
hi
hi
what's new
just got to work
eating a cliff bar
lol
that was strange. I went to grab a pack of mini chips ahoy and ate one, but it was a mini oreo...
its like when you take a drink expecting water and its soda
lol wow
fuck i forgot to go anonymous/invisible in skype
gg
lol
sure enough
MIKE
COMRADE
lol exactly
so how bout that halo master chief collection
lol right
it actually almost makes me want an xbone
mmmmmmm :x
did you see the halo 5 trailer?
or, sneak peek
no
me neither
lol
lol
apparently it had arbiter in it
what
thats what people are saying
nevermind
might not exist
i wonder where xbox would be without halo
DUUUUUUUUUUUUUUDE
it...kinda wouldn't "be"
yeah
Halo 5 and halo mc edition might make an xbone worth getting
i'd be fun playing halo ce and halo 2 with original physics and stuff but new graphics
multiplayer
lol
if I'm dropping money on a console it's going to be a WiiU for the new Smash
and Mario kart
lol
will tune in at 4
oooh
Net assassin's creed during the french rev
LET THEM EAT CAKE
Dude you start on Notre dame
annnnd it'....well are you watching it?
no
im at work :p
The map will be bigger than all other game environments combined
which is fucking nuts
i only ever played the first one
lol same
I wanted to play Black Flag
but this one might be multiplayer on PC
the tards pissed me off too much so i stopped playing it like 1/4 way through
hahahahahah
every five seconds, suddenly pushed in to a guard by a tard and attacked
lol i remember that
tard killing spree
so fun and horrible
you can drop in on friends
unsure if on PC yet
can you troll friends by dropping in to their session and knocking them in to guards?
lol uhhh
why would you do that
maybe
i hope not
jerk
lol
suddenly "ALLAH HUA AKBAR" and you get knocked off a roof
jeeeeeerk
wtf
ok chrome debug
if I uncheck a line
it looks amazing
if i take out that line in CSS
the actual file
nothing changes
lol
that is the most terribly inaccurate article i've ever read lol
the comments are kinda funny though
lol
hey
tony
did origin bill you anything in addition to what the games you bough cost?
....nnnnooooooo why
Origin billed me three $1.00 transactions in addition to my $10 game...
wat
and I have no clue why
did you use paypal or a straight credit card number?
straight debit card
lol
..hm
and again, i hate origin
wow
a lot of people have had this happen
with charges up to $70
whaaaaaaaaaat
o.o
oh shit
from what I'm reading there's a fee to verify your card?
one guy had over $1000 in charges....
some places do have a verify fee
it should only charge your card once though
Guess I'll have to just keep an eye on that
anyways afk
Yeah from what I read there's a preauthorization charge per order
so he bought one game once a lot a lot a lot
New Zelda looks gorgeous
Tombraider needs Steam
WOO
STEAM
...ok so I downloaded Tombraider....
took a good hour and a half
it's a steam code
so i plugged in the steam code
and now Tombraider's downloading -_-
I have another hour apparently
I feel like the Zelda series has lost its roots :/
OOT 4 lyfe
and majora's mask
Are you insinuating progress is bad?
I'm insinuating that you're insinuating that progress is bad.
I like progress when you stick to your roots
OOT was best
As long as we don't get another CD-i abomination I'm fine
Zelda has gone way off track
So has Mario
^
He's driving Karts now
lol
and being a Doctor
OOT IS BEST
And playing Tennis
(Yes Nao OOT is best)
Doctor Mario was like 1987 you know
im glad we agree
(So is Majora and Wind Waker)
Wind Waker was fun
never played wind waker
majora is also best
Twilight Princess was weird, but enjoyable
<<< 
^yus
Now, are you talking about Hyrule Warriors, or Zelda U?
of course the asian won the smash bros match
Hyrule Warriors is different
Zelda U and most of the recent games have seemed... off course?
lol i believe that
about the asian
Skyward sword wasn't bad
It was a new way to show dungeons and i dig that.
game froze
hhhoooowww
hiiii
hi
a million ways to die in the west: fucking hilarious
it's out now?
like really though
yep
somehow convinced my parents to see that over edge of tomorrow
and they loved it too
i totally thought that movie was called "Live. Die. Repeat"
hahaha
no
sadly
that would be a bad title
anyone on that mc server?
dunno
well i am now lol
or not
this internet cannot connect
:F
tried killing mumble, nope
if i kill skype it'd probably work
that seems to fix everything
it is extremely funny except for the sex talk shit... makes it rather unfunny in those parts imo
yeah
it was still funny
but it was definitely over the top
the drug trip scene i was dying
like family guy at those awkward moments
and yes
that was hilarious
btw i done werk on the nether wart farm
orly
as in, it is functional?
get in mumble fool
not quite yet
so yeah
not working
k :/
the farm is almost ready though
awesome
just need to finish replacing the floor with soul sand and add in the minecart tracks
and then it shal be ready
but first.... i need hasteII potions
because mining slowly is terrible
actually i dont have that much left... laziness activate!
guys
it is glorious
also, we need more nether wart to plant it
because it's only halfway done
very nice
how do you harvest? auto or manual?
seriously, that's a crapton of netherwart
manual
because farmer xp
gotcha
i'm very excited for new internets tomorrow
i hope they don't disappoint me
wooooo00000000OOOOOOOOOOOO
lol
much hap
very py
very hazard
i want pie
haphazard
lol
andrew, did you see that link i linked earlier today at like... around noonish?
was it youtube?
no
imgur?
no
oh
that programming languages thing
yeah
no i did not
couldnt remember the site
mashable
lol
but i will look
It's funny
it's kinda what you'd be led to believe from college
lol
but it is so wrong
and the comments show that really well
i cant see the comments
they wont load
but yeah
i can see that it is a bit skewed
you should be able to?
lynda.com, their source, is that tutorial thing our college gives us access to, so i'm not surpised the "college languages" are the top
lol
sql really isnt a language
which is funny
lol comments finally popped up
took a minute to load them in
lol
yeah that's interesting
i'm surprised they didnt make some joke about the recursive nature of PHP
(the name)
their descriptions are pretty well done for the most part. at least the description for python is
everyone is totally bashing c/c++ in the comments and yet that is the language we use for 99% of our classes
our classes are dumb
lol
lol
dumn
especially using c
c++ is understandable because it's at least usable
but for the things we do, there are better languages for them, and that is something they should be teaching at a basic level
don't use a hammer when a crescent wrench makes 10000% more sense
or just teach that there are languages that are unlike c
maybe teach about web languages
because the web is kinda a big deal
lol
nahh, the web is just a fad
eventually we'll go back to snail mail and telegrams
nah, we'll at least keep binary morse code
well that's basically a telegram
lol
but with super long binary encoding!
lol
Doctors - The web is kind of a big deal.

Doctors - The web is kind of a big deal. Basically a telegram.
hahaha "watch were you going you foo" - first episode of courage the cowardly dog
I haven't heard that line in years xD
Doctors - Watch where you going you foo!
lol
did you ever play fire emblem?
no
it is one of the best emulator games for your phone

i'm enjoying my third playthrough

would you be willing to help me build an ASS?
gentlemen: stage one of the industrial farm is finished
I could help build an ASS
i dont think we could use water/ice streams though. the server's tick rate is kinda bad
we'd have to use hoppers for the whole thing
what about hopper minecarts?
i dont think that would work with the old ass design
maybe
JL also has a new design that might be better than what we used before
orly?
I think so
he at least had a new setup for potions, which I think used hopper carts
well since im an alchemist on the server, i don't want automated potions
all the xp >:)
yeah, but just the sorting component of their setup might be usable
who knows
do they have crazy item stacking on that server?
they do
because that was an issue before
it's kinda insane how far they stack
lol
that can cause problems
using hoppers instead of water streams also fixes that
the only problem I can see with using a hopper cart is, if the cart is away from the input and you put in a ton of the same item type, then the cart will pick up like 30 stone or whatever
then, as it is driving over the sorting hoppers, those will only pull out like 1
true
since it builds up and isnt just always sending items out as they come in
could back it up then
iron isnt that hard to get though. we could just mine a ton
so while that one is fast, it's inefficient, and hoppers are efficient but slow
and we have herp
iron isn't an issue
hoppers are faster than the cart would be
vgh
hoi :3
under most conditions
So that's where all the redstone went to :P
the cart would be fast if we rarely put in items and only put small amounts in at once
yeah
like single item sorting
I say just tons of hoppers
lol
also ment, the redstone is in deep storage
Do we have an area for an ASS?
becase herp mined too much of it
yes
not dug out yet, but a general area
I'm at work till like 5:30, home at around 6. not sure if I'm doing anything later today
Is this chromahills or the new one everyone is on?
and we have a double chest full of redstone blocks
new one
new one
ah
do we have quartz for comparators?
we've got a bunch I've mined but yet unused
ok, we dont need a whole lot, just 1 or 2 comparators per item we sort
yes
so 5 stacks? :{
we have like 18 stacks of quartz
and i can easily mine more
that's way more than enough lol
lol
I'll try to get on later today around 6pm and we could work on it then, if that works for you
How will we organize the ASS?
might make sense to organize by profession
sorting custom foods and stuff would probably take too much room
but, gotta go to a lunch/tech talk thing for an hour
afk
vgb
Brandon's work lunches sound like classy parties
lol
too tired to do anything today
I know the feeling.
Aaaannnd tomorrow i've got some unexpected travelling to do
back from lunch
ish
only a few hours to new internet!!
woo comcast should be here any minute now :D
so excite
wow
it's funny
most people would rather die than get comcast
yet comcast is your savior
^
Andrew is a Comcastunist.
we must burn him at the steak
and then eat the steak
without offering him any
in 9101990 seconds it will be time for Within Temptation concert :D
when you phrase it like that it doesn't seem so far away
lol
umm
9 million seconds
yuh
yeah, that's less than 10 million
lol
less than 8 digits
what in the hell
ok gonna rage
was gonna rant about time distortion
hat in the well
but now I want to rage
I really wonder how this dude became this designer mogul's right hand man
Like, he's either ultra-boss or something sketch is going down
His boss pays for his housing apartments, one of those new hi-rises
His boss and him flew to new york to curate art for a new gallery here
and His boss apparently took him to E3
like that's a fucking DREAM
Probably just envious but man -_-
uber boss?
What did I originally come here to say... oh:
2-6 goes faster when you're waiting to work at 6-10 instead of working 2-6
yes
haaaatred
so apparently the summer steam sale starts on the 19th of this month
x_X
oh hell
my lack of good computer has sheltered me from these steam summer sales for the last few years
I am both excited and scared
be afraid
this is cool http://davidwalsh.name/parallax?utm_source=html5weekly&utm_medium=email
interesting
this is also cool http://ionicframework.com/
Thaaaat's cool.
INTERNETTTTTTT
WOOOOO
WOOOO
WOOOOOO
this is the slowest test i've been able to get, with downloading several things from three devices (the router isnt the greatest)
with no traffic it shows 28 down
woo
should easily handle gaming
lol
yeah
sadly, my foray into the new internets is being cut short
time for dinner
:F
WER THUINDERRR

deco, is there some way to get more seeds out of a vine grown plant?
No :/
one
every
time
how did you get so many grape seeds?
i dont get any seeds from these tomatoes
lol
You sheer the vines to get more
and place the vines
i swear i tried that
lol
do i left click with the shears? right click isnt doing anything
hai
hi
finallyback.jpg
veryfull.gif
oh, you do left click
yep
i coulda told you taht
lol
jeez
well why didnt you?!
you so noob
(i didnt really know, m31 hadn't gotten that far when i had to leave)
lol
I made BLTs
why u no mumble?
I mumble
are you going to mc?
yeah
ok
i will mumble then
y u make me mumble then go
:l
ohai
hai
we should crime or wt or something
bit tired for mc
lol
no wt
mehbeh crime
if only Mass Effect was mutiplayer
you'd have to help me through the process
ME3 has mp
but i only have 360 version
and it's like co-op pve
it was really reallly fun when i played it
help you through...crime?
yes
i've literally only played once
like
one mission
and i died
lol
oh lol
i'm down
is nao down?
nao may be sleeping
he hopped off mc a bit ago
i got stuck on phone with gf :F
lol
do you want to try a game of crime?
sure
im on already
oh damn
my pro team is on
you could probably join us if you wanted
lol
you learn fast, yeah?
yeah, fairly
We'll get you level 10 in 2 games if all goes well.
that would be nice
we're gonna finish this day and we'll invite you
day? as in til midnight?
holdup
no
some missions have "days"
ah
lol
gotcha
cuz i'm frackin tired haha
join steamchat
last day
jsut stand around and look pretty, essentially
you'll probalby level up
WHAR YOU GO
hi
skype is being stupid and not pulling in old messages
vgh
hi
hi
hi
alienware has a cool looking steam box
lol
brandon you should have joined us for crime last night
it was fun
i went to bed at like 11
lol
i went from level 2 to level 27
wow
lol why so early?
because I get up at 8
ah, for work?
yeah
why so early lol isnt it a come in at your own pace thing?
well, i get there at like 9:30
ah, so not THAT bad
whatcha been working on lately?
oh n ao
In the span of a few crimes we levelled andrew from 2 to 27
wait
shit
it'd help if I read, wouldn't it?
lol
I didnt tell him it took like 4 crimes
i went from 2 to 11 in the first crime
lol
that was seriously fun
like
i want to play more
:F
lol I'm down
lez do eet
wait, now?
haha i'm bored, so if you're not busy i could play
ooone second
I want to play :l
come play!
I cant
You *can* even.
lol
back
just tell your boss you have robberitis and have to go home
lol
i am bored
i have literally nothing to do
x_x
gettin' paid :D
^
lemme know when you get home, we could crime or something
I'll get home around 6, probably gonna play mc though
lol
I just saw the thing about revese engineering the seeds
lol
of course its possible
that should be obvious
its just not worth it
but it doesnt need to be possible
I dont consider something that takes millions of years to be "possible"
his method only takes 8 hours and doesnt even require joining the server. sounds pretty easy to me
yeah, it's definitely something they could fix
really easily too
but meh
if people want to take 8 hours to figure out a seed, by all means go ahead imo
on second thought
i feel like that's something we would have done at some point just to exploit something
lol
I wish Mike had a gf or somesuch
he's so neeeeedy
the guy said it's a 12 line fix, and 8 hours is nothing lol
It could also be done much faster on an SLI system
and yeah, it's something people would definitely exploit
we've exploited our ability to access the server seed before :F
is that real? lol
yes
vid
so THATS the camera I was hacking on people in watch dogs
I was wondering why these soldiers walked around with cameras on them
lol?
it streams the camera over wifi
yup
oh
you mean in watchdogs lol
that is what I said
lol
i thought you were commenting on the vid and was thinking "how the hell else would they make that happen?"
oh
so
something somewhat awkward and funny happened at work today
right at the end of the day, I'm talking with my boss about this project
and evidently his balls were stuck to his leg or something
but for like 10 minutes while talking to me he is moving his legs in the most awkward way and like rubbing his pants
trying to be discrete but totally failing
all while maintaining eye ontact and conversation
lol
it was so hard for me not to laugh
you should've just put himi out of his misery and been like "I've been there dude, just clear yourself."
lol
ewwww ballz
grody!
How's tomb raider tonizzle?
wat
indeed
lol

tombraider is amazin
the UI is cool and the map design is just brilliant
i am tempted to make a web app that nicely shows those recipies with a searchable index
like NEI
that would be cool
really easy to do too
you know what else is cool and easy?
cool whip
getting on mumble :F
but i am enjoying my calm and music
Ian and I have decided that the new sexiest trend is having your ear ripped off.
Its called the Van Gogh
lol
a great song
Courtney had never been rick rolled
Can you believe that
I made a reference
still havnt
and she was like
wut
Andrew
crime?
and/or nao, crime?
in a bit maybe
looking into building an auto fish farm for the server
lol righto
lol an auto fish farm would be so useful
yeah, i just need someone to tell me where to put it
lol
i think i'm just gonna stick it on the outpost
I'm trying to find what food has the best hunger restoring to effort required to craft ratio
Hold onto your wallets
The steam summer sale approaches
supposed to be in about a week
yup
I love the videos people come up with
lolol
his face at the beginning of the song
If ever there was a religion/cult I belong to, I'm sure it's the PCMR
lol
ghost love score instrumental :D
that link doesnt work
?
yours has better drums
no, this is official
released today
oh lol
it's the 10 year anniversary since that album was released
nightwish needs to do a US tour, and then I will be able to see all 3 of my bands :D
lol
makes me want to learn the words to that thing
somehow I dont think you could pull this song off
you dont really have that strong female voice
lol
i'll show you
lol
inb4 socks blown off
lol
female, no
but I think I can do that key
I should visit europe
just to go to a NW concert
not a bad idea
when you're young is the best time to travel
speaking of which
work :<
ahq
ahq
the people in the office beside ours just fired up a drone quad copter
about 10 seconds later all I hear is rotors hitting a wall and then silence
lol
rofl
haha
so i have determined that changing outlets and switches purely for their asthetical equivalent (different color) is stupid and should not be done by me. ever.
lol why?
did you forget to turn power off to them first? :p
took straight four hours to do five outlets because the grounding wires were about a fucking inch thick and had to fit into half an inch hole
no
but
the power to two of the outlets was also hooked to the AC
so it was about 85 while i was doing it
inside
lol
haha
next to a fridge that was heating up because the power there was also off
so it was also moist
gross.jpg
why did you want to change outlet/switch colors?
I didnt
my mom did
lol
she wanted white ones instead of cream
I was gonna say that doesnt seem like someting you'd do
uhh no
shit works, don't touch it
haha
well at least you remembered to turn the power going to them off
for the first three hours I didnt have any needle nose pliers
so i used bulky ass ones that didnt work
lol
then i remembered my dad had a pair in his fishing gear
so my hands smell like fish
lol
sounds like you had a fun afternoon then
SO fun
well, i sat here
and... sat here
oh and the power shut my pc off, and i was afk farming fish
with nothing to do
so sadface
lol
you made that auto fisher? :D
yep
nice
we need a good source of string
their spider spawner is sloooowwwww
we also need a good source of bones
their skele spawner is slow as balls
they have a skele spawner
ah
yeah
we need to make the "outpost" the new hub of materials
it's not because of design or anything, it's just a slow-ass spawner
yeah
we need to make multiple
i wonder if fishing levels my cooking skill
dunno
i'm a level 200 fisherman
really? lol
well, skill level
its mcmmo
yeah
not their other thing
but yeah
went from 27 to 200 in a night
any fishing perks?
mostly better catch rate and less traps, etc
also better loot
lol yeah, how does it handle the fished up tnt?
tnt drops in front of you, but if you're wearing good armor it wont hurt you enough to drop your hunger
the tnt doesnt damage blocks
thanks to towny
that's good
but yeah, if you got really unlucky afk there you could die from damage/hunger drop
yeah
if you were wearing full diamond with blast prot IV, you'd be totally fine
like, no damage at all
the way it's set up has a pressure plate and a 1 block drop to the player's feet, so you only take 2.5 hearts with full iron
and only like 5 hearts with nothing
i bet something could be done to physically block the tnt
a half slab or something
definitely, but I didnt want to make it any harder for a new person to figure out
hell even just placing a flower inbetween tnt and yourself drops damage down to like 1/2 a heart
yeah
visibility was my reasoning for not adding protection
yeah
even if we die... we have so many resources lol
worst part would be it spewing out all of the fishing rods
yeah and the fish still get collected up to that point
i'm guessing it's doing that now
but it grabs them back fast enough that they don't despawn
yeah
imma check on it now :F
im so bored :F
you have nothing to work on?
nope
lol
what is your 20/80 project?
nadda
lol
they havent said anything about that
interesting
i think mc auth servers are down, it won't let me play online
or log in
lol
yep, login and session are down
to mollstam's twitter!
ah
lol
reddit.com/r/minecraft sidebar
huh, nice
so
i was thinking we should do our doctor thing and automate everything, but this time do it for the peeps in rikoto
so i want to make an auto jungle tree farm for the woodsmen
I'm just a cook, man! I aint to mechanic!
codecrafted has a design, but no tutorial, just a world download
auto jungle tree farm? to cubify the wood?
yeah
spruce might be better
since thats what they build with
jungle gives most xp per log
that's why i was thinking it
100 vs 70 for spruce
ah
yeah
dropping a 4x4 jungle tree with their tree fell ability gives 3 xp
I'll let you handle that. I'll tackle the issue of automatic storage :p
er
2x2
sounds good to me
lol
i also think we need a vanilla mob farm
because those mobs don't give a 50% xp drop like the ones from spawners
also a source of unami would be nice
unami?
or whatever its called
that thing mobs drop that is used for a bunch of food recipies
never heard of it lol
but yeah
a mob farm would be really useful
i wonder how they handle their mob spawning though
no clue
we'd need to make it in the resource world probably
because mob spawning is disabled in rikoto land
i imagine a traditional doctor style farm would work just fine
oh hmm yeah
resource world could get griefed
i think you can section areas off and change tags though
and would get wiped
they have a pvp enabled area in rikoto as well
so maybe
probably
would be cool
i still want to make a recipie web app
i'm thinking of dropping soldier and going woodsman since i'm doing this tree farm
it would be cool
and like you said, easy
easy ish lol
well yeah
it's a lot of work but it'd be fun
needs search by ingredient
I'd make it modular so you can just drop in a json file with other recipies and have it add it all
so like... a json for acropocalypse, one for some other mod, one ofr vanilla, etc
and yeah, search by item
sounds like a good plan
would shop recipie first, uses second
am i spelling recipie right? lol
it seems wrong to me
can you use work time to do something like that since it's research type deal
it is wrong
recipe
there you go
lol
lol
i knew it seemed wrong
i always think ress-i-pe
but replace the ss with c
lol
brb
I'm not sure how I should handle sorting items for this server
it's quite a bit different with these mods/use cases
yeah i noticed that would be more difficult
maybe you only sort vanillla items and manually sort the mod based ones
although, i'm pretty sure all rice will stack with all rice, etc, so that would be fine
slow tick rate makes hoppers worse though
I'm wondering if one big central sorter is better, or multiple smaller ones
probably smaller ones
yeah
like, one for farming area, one for mob drops, one for building mats
etc
I could use non overflow-protected sorters maybe
and just slow it down to avoid overflow
that would make each sorter cheaper, more compact, and simpler
so then I could sort more items
like tomatoes and rice
yeah
but at the same time, that wont work for certain things
idk though, overflow seems like it'll be something that happens
like when herp dumps massive amounts of redstone in
or rather, something that will happen
or tons of wheat
yeah
lol
or m31 tossing in potatoes
there are two main categories of items, and many sub categories
the two main being items we get a lot of, and items we only get some of
which arent static groups really...
not at all, the only static members would be cobble and probably wheat
and soon taters
or whatever staple crop we have
yeah
lol
well, the doc base sorter was capable of handling both groups but is just a lot of work to build lol
and suffers from item stacking
yeah
and doing an all hopper method would contribute significantly to tick load
item stacking can kill it
and that would be bad
lol
yeah
and a minecart method also has issues
like load/unload
yeah
and requiring a buffer to hold inbetween load/unload
you know what I think?
we hire jammer to sort?
just make tubes with labels, and have people toss them into some kind of deep storage unit type deal
possible
totally manual sort, but no human chest organization
just set that up for each guild house or something, and they'd be good
that would separate your subgroups
this takes a lot of room though... those guild places are rather small
tack on a storage hut to the side of each
lol
storage hut... 2x larger than the building it is attached to
lol
in the case of the cook hut, probably
I could just sort items that we obtain a lot of
woods, blocks you get while mining, crops
yeah
that would work
let people manually sort the rest
yep
I wish minecraft had barrels
that would make this so much better
seriously
well
it kinda does
if you stack chest carts
dat laggy
lol
it also doesnt guarantee only 1 item type
lol yeah
it would require some kind of sorting beforehand
these people next office over think their drone is going to get to the top of the stratosphere
they are gonna have a bad time
lol
I should go home :F
although traffic will get bad soon
although my boss is leaving now
lol
lol go home, although, you could wait til the auth servers are back and keep making money until you can actually play
or you could just make that recipe app
lol
I'm gonna head home in a minute
hi
hi
you playin mc?
im watching guude play TTT
and also making a list of all food items
TTT?

im making an autohotkey script to hold right click lol

i dont have one on this new computer yet

done
I bound to ctrl alt ]
and hold left is ctrl alt [
lol
nice
i am bored
i want to make a bunch of food for people but ingredients for good food are in short supply
what do you need/
well, I ultimately want to make a few foods in large quantities
one food will just restore a lot of hunger. that will probably be beef jerky
banana cream pie/cherry pie for haste
something else for speed and jump boost probably
and maybe a few other foods just for fun
beef jerky just needs salt and rotten flesh
BLT's are good, but gaining that many extra hearts is kinda annoying
since you basically use up all of your saturation regerating those additional hearts
so that's why my melons seem like eating hunger sapping leeches
lol yes
unfortunately beef jerky gives 0.5 xp per....
ewww
that's tiny
my fish give more than that
indeed
I could make lemon chicken
lemons + chicken
then I get exp for killing chickens + crafting the food
lemon chicken supposedly gives 9 hunger back, like beef jerky
are you on mumble?
yep
how do you get lemons?

MIKE WON'T STOP TALKING TO ME
COMRADE
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO
I WANTED TO SEE IF YOU WANTED TO HANG OUT
The caps is strong in that one.
tis
ok yay
I have discovered interesting and potentially exploitable behavior on the mc server
a way to break all blocks in a line pushed by a piston instantly
o.o
wow
freaking do it
it's kinda awkward to set it up and is a bit quirky
requires a banana and a leaf block
no joke
lol
how the hell do you discover this stuff?
i was trying to increase my banana yield
the thought process was, if I can push a fortune-able block in place of the banana block, then fortune it, it may drop bananas instead
and lots of them
unfortunately I haven't gotten to test that because I dont have a fortune pick
lol so instead you broke every-block-in-a-row
it only seems to work with certain blocks
and is subject to the 12 block limit of pistons
ah
it's like a tiny mining laser
the only real application I can think of is auto cutting trees
thank fucking god I went invisible
just got a call form mike
I didn't answer it
not 2 seconds later
on skype
Mike Holt is Online.
I also gtfo Facebook
so auto banana tree farm idea didnt pan out
lol
dangit
i managed to harvest all but 1 block of that tree with a piston
lol
it also destroys the soil block the tree is grown on
but with clever pistons that wouldnt be an issue
whenever you get back deco, I had to go, working on my desk for a bit
okay
I wound up not eating
no food
then kerbal
I built literal flying battleship
jeb looks like he's having fun
bill, not so much
i am done working on my desk for now, glue has to dry
wat dooin
finishing the cow farm
moo
moooo
or as cows sound in minecraft: Meerrrrrrrrrrh
mooooo moo moo moo. moo. moo.
moo
i made a semi auto hax banana tree farm, ap
i heard
i saw
seems legit, the banana mechanics seemed exploitable
it turns out it has nothing to do with the banana fruit block
it's just super weird pistons
oh really?
yeah
wow
pushing a tree up just breaks the tree
weird server mechanic?
lol wow
havent tested anything other than banana trees
that's cook
er
cool
yeah
doesnt get the top block of the tree
which is annoying
also breaks the soil
which is annoying
indeed
too bad, cause that could be auto-wood
lol
with some clever piston usage I think it could be auto wood
we'd want to use something with easier saplings to get though
yeah, that's for sure
I still think a simple block wood farm would be best
you should test if tree felling works with piston moved blocks
it wont
i figured not
it has to be a naturally generated (world gen or sapling) wood block
that have some kind of special tag on the block or something?
yeah
ah
they have a plugin like the one i wanted to make
that allows them to store data on world position
nice
I've been poking at it trying to find ways to exploit it lol
lol
hola compadres
COMRADE
lol
KOMRADE
what are you guys up to?

hi Mez
Hi Ment

Lol yeah
Skype is just strangely quiet.
COMRADE!
shhhhh
sh
KOMRADE!
ohai
How goes the desk by the way?
We were up late playing the minecrafts
lol
(Brandon the desk question was for you)
^
Unless Ian has a secret desk
not yet :(
umm
one leg assembly is almost assembled
(of the T-1000)
...
lol
How long has that one leg been almost assembled?
well, we have the two halves glued, one of them is still drying. probably dry by now really
then, we have to connect the two halves
and that leg unit will be done
this sounds uber complex ._.
then we have to make another leg unit
and the top
lol
we're doing it the legit way
with biscuits!
lol no joke
wait what
biscuits
yeah
they make the joints strong
ahah
AHAH
that's what that is
that's so weird
lol
"plate joiner" makes more sense than "biscuit joiner"
semantically to me anyways
we also have the 8 legs of the other leg unit made, but not sanded
aaaaaah
naooo
nice
thanks
Figured out they had to be sized to the grid after viewing a few example sites
woo responsive
they're practically brain food
lol
lol
don't ever put calc 3 materials on skype ever again, you hear me young man!
Take the derivative along the rim of a pringle and you get pure deliciousness
I didn't think that was so bad
lol
I mean
it could be worse
then a potato product
lol
'Dat Tombraider
I'm very excited for the next one now.
lol, you beat it?
yeah
When IS that steam sale?
in 4 days
not soon enough
you ever browse /r/web_design mez?
yeah
I've been browsing it lately at work because I have nothing to do and it at least relates to work, lol
lol
oh hey
mountaindew.com uses masonry
It's where I got a gigantor list of resources for a school project
HEY
Hangout next Saturday?
hi
what kind of hangout?
Ricardos was on the mind
would a friday be doable?
most likely
just cuz my work is right by ricardos lol
Unless something else was on your mind of course
but yeah, just throwing that out there
Mai's hanging with a friend Saturday
I can make whenever work
and I must flee now
cyyya
flee! be flee!
meow meow woof woof
oink
wat doin
about to go shower/go to bed
gotcha
have fun
work tomorrow?
yup
andrew
there is special food in the cook's kitchen
eat ittttt
i slaved over a hot workbench all day and hardly any has been eaten
lol
what is it?
cheese burgers, french fries, and soda
oh nice
i'm almost out of my stack of bananas so i'll go grab something
I had an orange soda earlier
it was awesome
i tweaked the banana farm to be better
the saplings are lowered 1, so they are in the ground
that way even max height trees are all cuttable without towering up at all
the saplings grow fine, even surrounded by dirt on all sides
that's a good plan
hi
hi
I want to play more MC :p
lol o_O
lolz
hi
hi
wat doin
waiting to figure out if i'll have anything to work on today
lol
my guess: no
lol
that would be unfortunate
i hit a random key combo on accident
now everything i type in sublime gets wrapped in |'s
>_<
yeeesh
lol
that sounds entertaining. did you fix it? lol
somehow tabbing out to skype and then tabbing back fixed it
lol
but the good news is, I have stuff to work on now
woo
the bad news is, my mouse and keyboard were out of stock
so i wont have them till wednesday
ohno
link or name?
?
to the keyboard/mouse
washable keyboard, generic wireless mouse
lol
ok lol
16th jun 
no link to tribesnext in the review though! at least it's top in the comments
yeah but the comments do :D
does*
Star Citizen..
play?
no play?
i thought it wasnt out yet?
isn't
preorder?
no preorder?
isnt it still quite far from release?
yeaaaaaaaah
YEA OR NAY
IS MY QUESTION
do whatever you want?
from what you've seen/heard/read, would you?
I just want battle buddies is my problem
I've looked in to the game very little
Basically I am waiting until the game is fully released to decide
righto
from what i've seen: not ready
they just now released the dogfighting module, and that's not even fully developed yet
there's only you vs bots
no pvp
huge, core components of the game don't exist yet. can't judge it until the actual final gameplay elements exist in at least some form
yep
elite dangerous is closer to being a fully realized game than star citizen
but even it isnt ready yet
nao
IS there anyone here who has watchdogs? Who hasn't visited reddit today yet?
i don't have watchdogs and i didnt visit reddit, do i win a prize?
Apparently Watchdogs has graphics settings hardcoded in the native files
people hacked it to display better
and the result is glorious
the settings are literally called E3_whatever=?;
e3_rain
e3_texture
they crippled it before publishing so the PC would be on par with console
i think it is more likely that they crippled it because it runs terribly
they said there was a minimal difference in gameplay
actually a lot of people are saying they get better performance with the mod
so lol
GG ubisoft I guess
lol great
i drove by ubisoft's offices in san fran a few days ago
they looked kinda ghetto
Steam sales have begun
wut
no
nooooooooooo
nooooooooooooooooooooooo
my wallleeeeeeeeeet
yesssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
i dont see the sale
lol
neither do i
did it begin today?
i dont think it's begun yet
I see Just Cause for $3
not yet
supposed to start the 19th
^
Thats what I heard
everyone get Age of Wonders III
Just Cause 2 is just a daily deal
it is sad that Spintires is at the top of the top sellers list
it is hardly even at a point where it can be called a beta
yeah :I
wut
duuuude
wow
werw
the AI when I played would never have run up to a car crash and helped the people
lol
well that was annoying
this website displays a giant blocker thing if you have adblock on
I had to open up chrome inspector and block their blocker
the nerve of some people!
lol
they also apparently had a script running to keep the blocker on the page even if you delete the element
o.o
so that site was to download a cool shader pack for mc
but
the website has ads, tries to force you to endure the ads, then the downloads page goes to a url shortener/ad service, which then goes to another ad service, which may or may not have continued to more ads
...
and the links on the page try to make you go in a circle between more and more ads
@_@ what site is this
also: https://scontent-a-sjc.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpf1/t31.0-8/1048_1015855758440_8404978981109887989_o.jpg
mine is on the right
I only now realize that my cone looked like a cock and balls
kek
was this lunch again?
this was dinner an hour or two ago
lol oy
oh so I couldn't get Mass Effect to work on Origin
updated to 1.02
nope
invalid registration code or something
got on EA support
they gave me a new code
still didn't work
see? origin is terrible
I hate origin
So they had me sign up with an EA classic screenname and pogo (I guess they own pogo?)
and reinstalled
Still nope.
unfortunately I have to use it for some games... but I do so wishing origin to die!
yeah
I guess I could just pirate the cracked versions of the game
they work better than the real deal
....
I could
cheaper, too
....
hell they even have better support
XD yeah
...
I just want to be shephard commander god dammit
shephard commander
Legion calls him Shephard Commander.
lol
I should play ME3 some time
I dont remember if I finished ME2 though
I JUST WANT MY DECISIONS FROM ME1 TO CARRY OVER
I got all excited when I saw "genesis" which allowed you to make all key decisions
I played ME1 on xbox and ME2 on pc
so
yeaaah
and then not-excited when I realized it was DLC -_-
sooo batmobile car?
Apparently you rode all the things you could at for Burning Man
the one with the fuzzy seat apparently has a 1400 watt stereo system or something
i.e. more powerul than most concerts
NANANANANANNANANANANANANA
BATMAN
Now onto the lair of BatNao
he lurks, with his side kick Mezrobin, master of puns
i think ian has lost it
I am not Ian
are you SuperIan?
No
I am
The Quizler
Hahahaha
BatNao you cannot defeat me
but I already have!
you will never find where I hid MezRobins joke book
but it doesnt matter
I slipped poison in to your morning coffee
Is it on your person?
Mr. Quizler?
<.<
Well then
I guess B)
The joke's on you.
The Quizler spilled his coffee this morning!
Onto the book!
What a hot mess!
You both have been foiled!
the poison was airbourn though
the hot coffee was just a way to get it in to the air
always takes his coffee iced
removes disguise
ME3 is awesome
well it's a good thing BatNao had a backup plan
Ah, its my good friend, the Duck
The Duck will easily defeat your backup plan BatNao
My backup plan is that the Duck is actually my ally
and he stabbed you
37 times
with a 7 inch serated blade
A shocking turn of events
through all of your major organs
The Duck does not have a blade
^
well then maybe he used a spoon. idk
only a high speed electron pulse pistol
that'll do it
wut
the Duck shot you 37 times with a high speed electron pulse pistol
in all of the major organs
37 shots would result in a nonexistant decosine
just vapor and dust particles
Well, if the quizler is dead, how is the quizler still quizzing?
that, my friend, is quite quizzical
deco must be an imposter
that's the only explanation
Perhaps, the imposter was who was vaporized
anyone want to war some thunders? i'm feelin it
I do
Originate has a new website. It seems weird to me
I vote for the thunders
of war
gimme like 5-10 minutes
but i'm down
kkkkk
Brandon said he's in
i did?
yes
or did i?
gonna start it up to see if updates, but yeah i'll be like 10mins
[10:35:13 PM] Brandon Worl: i'm in
um
no updates
yay
that is lies
no <.<
brandon wants to airacobra
or kingcobra
or both
KonigKobra
i was thinking more like shower then read then sleep
nooooo
playyy
Ian
[10:37:57 PM] Brandon Worl: i was thinking more like war thunder then war thunder and war thunder
Ian
Ian
[10:36:73 PM] Ian: I dont want to war thunder
Fuuuuck origin
lol
wow
We're apparently everywhere man.
Also, I like how there's apparently a strategy to the Summer Sale
Ian
Ian
Ian
i think something is broken
go on?
wait, did you resize the window?
I had to do that to get pictures to realign :/
oh
I see
you can probably force it to realign on page load
i apparently need to edit the .js for that
you're using a minified file though, right?
for masonry
i think
yes
that would make editing it near impossible, or you could edit the non minified file but then load times will increase a bit
.min
or you can edit the non minified then minify it
but i think you can use jquery for it
I know absolutely nothing about jquery
does that go in the js file or is it outside of it?
either
in this case probably better to go outside
im trying to see if you can do what you need with jquery
yeah
// or with jQuery
var $container = $('#container');
// initialize Masonry after all images have loaded$container.imagesLoaded( function() {
 $container.masonry();
});
that might be what you want
js is
var container = document.querySelector('#container');
var msnry;
// initialize Masonry after all images have loaded
imagesLoaded( container, function() {
 msnry = new Masonry( container );
});
those are equivalent
are you doing the js one already?
i don't know what i'm doing
Whta I'm thinking is, when the page finishes loading entirely, call whatever function makes the images align
do i just ad that in the min file to work?
no
dont edit the min file
" imagesLoaded works by triggering a callback after all child images have been loaded."
i pulled all of those straight from the masonry page
yeah, but you are already doing that no?
i don't know
i would assume
since masonry is there
and working
for the most part
Doesn't say anything about being default
?
<!-- in HTML -->
<div id="container" class="js-masonry"
 data-masonry-options='{ "columnWidth": 200, "itemSelector": ".item" }'>
that's what you are doing
that should be equivalent to either of the js options
data-masonry-options='{ "columnWidth": 225, "itemSelector": ".item", "isFitWidth": true, "gutter": 5 }
so basically I think you need to call .layout() on the masonry object when the page loads
probably something like this
var container = document.querySelector('#container');
var msnry = new Masonry( container, {
 columnWidth: 200,
 itemSelector: '.item'
});
window.onload = function() {
 msnry.layout();
};
with whatever your actual options are on the masonry container
Would I just put that in a script.js file and then link it in the html?
you could do that or just put it in script tags in the html
oh
that loads strangely...hm
does it flicker or somethig?
no it just accounts for images that aren't there
oh you'd have to remove the data-masonry-whatever from the div html
but
i think that will possibly cause flickering
i think that is the same issue
no overlap
transition seems faster actually
but I can't take out options in the div because that breaks it for some reason
?
did you put the options in the js?
yup
copy/paste?
to here
so i can see
<script>
     var container = document.querySelector('#container');
       var msnry = new Masonry( container, {
         columnWidth: 225,
         itemSelector: '.item',
         isFitWidth: true,
         gutter: 5
       });
       window.onload = function() {
         msnry.layout();
       };
   </script>
seems correct to me
ok try now
works, but it initially loads off to the side and then snaps to position
is that bad?
just weird?
weird, yeah
is it off-puttingly weird?
doing it like the first method in the appendix i linked may fix that
var container = document.querySelector('#container');
var msnry;
// initialize Masonry after all images have loaded
imagesLoaded( container, function() {
 msnry = new Masonry( container );
});
which is an easy change
@_@
or
instead of blah.onload
replace that onload line with
imagesLoaded( container, function() {
 msnry.layout();
});
that linked appendix is exactly verbatim what I was referencing the first two times
lol
im not sure if this will fix the loading off to the side thing or not, but it might
that just broke everything
not everything
but refresh
it's...weird
copy/paste the part in script tags
<script>
     var container = document.querySelector('#container');
       var msnry = new Masonry( container, {
         columnWidth: 225,
         itemSelector: '.item',
         isFitWidth: true,
         gutter: 5
       });
      imagesLoaded( container, function() {
       msnry.layout();
     });
   </script>
oh
you dont have imagesLoaded
lol
it's throwing an error in the chrome console
@_@
lol
oh my god
how many bloody scripts do i need
lol
there's probably a way to do it without using imagesLoaded
well, there definitely is because we just did it
but there's probably a way to do it without imagesloaded and without it looking weird
@_@
how does the lightbox look?
looks fine, though I wonder why the images take so long to load
might be the background color
how would that affect image loading?
*shrug* added element to render when there was none before
could also be the fact that it's shared with an entire wordpress site
no, neither of those should affect image loading
it's just a limitation with the way lightbox works i think
images should get cached after loading them once though
so it isnt a big deal
Yeah
hmmmmmmm my boss just left
and i have nothing to do now
:l
Praise Gaben?
lol
well i could go home early or i could stay here and just research ruby or something and get paid
GabeN expects my wallet to be nice and fat by Thursday, after all

so I've been trying to do that "Insanity" workout regimen
some words to describe it:
fucking stupid
which one is that, again?
A cousin of mine has done that one
Claims it's pretty intense
Intense workout
you might even say it is..... insane B)
^
nawww that's not even close
I'd call it... ridiculous
more insane than "tae bo"
why do you people keep saying "insane"
tae bo on krokodil
"insane" is a terrible word to describe Insanity
no
no is also terrible
terrible is a gas station and a casino
I hear russia has turned off the gas
Which explains why every time you fill up you're like, "noooooo:
lol
stephen amell, the dude who plays oliver queen on Arrow posted a few of his workout clips on facebook
at a parkour gym
it looks fun
jeeeeeezusw
yeah i saw that parkour gym
there's one in Vegas I think
and also super difficult
all I can think of is: gravity
freaking salmon ladder
I read salmon fodder
I think i'll go to bed

i dont know how to link to this.. 1 sec
i think its at the end
could you imagine just starting out at that place?
"What do i uhh....do"

AWW
ok so

1000 ways to die vs edge

oh god
umm
umm
ujmmmmmmmm
fuck
idk
lol
they're both SO GOOD

yeah
i guess it totally depends on your mood
if you want funny, go 1000000 ways, if you want anything else, go for edge
and i mean anything
romantic comedy: that's your movie
bloody action thriller: go for it
horror: yep
comedy: yep
lol wow....
Nazi Propaganda film?
it was one of those movies where the audience clapped for it when it was over
annd probably yes
actually
lol
you'd just have to add in a disclaimer at the beginning for whichever side you deemed the bad guy
so yeah, game? or is it too late now? :F
wrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr thhhhhhhhhhhhhnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnddddddddddddrrrrrrrrr
Tier VI
tier six?
yes
lol
soo the po-2?
Ki-10
ah yes
very honourable space plane
they patched it's flight model a bit
even fully upgraded it cannot totally helicopter anymore
but it can still climb at about 40 degrees
I will test this
I wish there was a version with a nose mounted 20mm
then I could fight jets with it
D: offer expired
soz
lol
all good
lol Ki-10 II C can still vertical takeoff
and gain speed
for how long?
∞
it got down to 40km/h for me and then the nose force dropped
My WEP came back on
so did mine
and I started climbing again
lol
Still going
well, in any case, they made it slightly harder. when we first did it i was at 90 degrees and never dropped below 90km/h
Yes
I am at 90 degrees
really?
and I only slow down to 50km/hr now
Well I just hit 45
actually
Then WEP
I made it to 4500m in a straight line
interesting
i had different results

hi
linux skype is weird
So I guess I was wrong. All you need is kill actually does have a translation
So is phone skype
Lol
lol
how goes it doctores

sehr gut
If you guys don't... <--don't remember what I was going to say here lol
lol
everyone see the new snapshot?
not yet
?
underwater temples and temple guardians
and new pretty blocks
and lights
and i think something to do with enchanting
it's a new enchant
lets you walk faster in water
ah
nice
got my keyboard :D
same as my washable keyboard at home.. but it feels so new compared to that one
the keys have texture!
guys
i am excited for the steam sale
I am now at war with my neighbors cat
I cleaned my car
and this morning
cat paws
all over it
lol
Cats are not human
So I can use chemical warfare
i was thinking hook up an electrical current to the frame of your car
I will make a capsaicin solution and spray the cat with it
or maybe get the cat all hopped up on the 'nip. Then, he'll lose his job, his family, and his livelihood. then, he will jump off a bridge, but land on his feet. He will feel like such a failure, and be totally unable to kill himself due to his lack of thumbs and inability to fire a gun.
But capsaicin solution is easy
well so is catnip
it just doesnt guarantee those exact results
Cat nip doesn't cause burning and days worth of pain
lol
oh
so
That should make the cat stay off my property for ever
are we doing ricardos this weekend?
Oh yes
I hope so
We need to talk to le tony
Tony is good for friday or saturday

I am good for Friday after 5:30

i asked tony about friday sometime between 5 and 6, he said yes
Sounds good to me
no reason not to have mexican food
these emoticons dont animate on ubuntu

so i could do things like -_-
and :3
and :I
without general retardation
I prefer :l over :I
I like :I because his cheeks look puffier
lol
usually I do :|
but that looks retarded in minecraft
that's a good neutral
and also apparently has a skype emoticon
but I like it the same reason I like :<
adds a little more
lol
so, you good for Ricardos on Friday at 5:30ish?
whats a courtney
ermmm

whatever the beginning of august is
Courtney can't come
yes she can
Canadians cannot into mexican food
she can drive
or fly
Also she has never left her homeland
uh
she just needs passport
alex does it all the time
thats not true
lol
I wasn't born here
where were you born?
Canada is an English puppet state
so
same thing
^was
^is

Functionally
Telford and Wrekin, Wellington, Shropshire, England
functionally, yes, but technically no
De facto > De jure

lol technically we are americas puppet

^
hat*
^
Both
meanest brother ever
haha
the kind of brother that rapes you in the sandbox
[6:56:58 PM] Courtney Boyle: meanest brother ever
No more money if you tell mum
cant say i'm familiar with that kind of brother
we may beat on you at times, and shun you from our cash flow, but we like having you as a hat
anyways
she COULD come
And we have to be nice because we owe mum 1.8 trillion dollars
she is CHOOSING not to
so BOOOOOOOOOOOO
xD
BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
eh
we do owe mum like 1.8tril
lol
give or take a few mil
Canada probably owes
"we should be afraid of China, we owe them 800 billion"
no
lol
Fear
England
We're on to you mum
but Alberta owes noboday nothing so BURN A CANOE EAST COAST
You owe us
all your oil sand
Or else
>.>
by or else, he means he's telling mom
and mom will say, oh yes, give it to your brother so he can pay us back
^
and we will say "but MOOOOM"
(read as MOO-M)
oh
did you hear, andrew? your fishing machine is no more
Banned by bob
I feel like that server puts too many limitations on stuff
eh, it's fun
"No thinking, do all things manually"
Burn a Canoe
What is that slang for?
dunno
Something to do with a moose probably
"Up Yours"
I like that
Burn a Canoe
are canoes important on the east coast and/or in canada?
lol its more making fun of stereotypical canada
canoes are
lol
we should have "Choke on an Eagle" or something
but not
for recreation
"Choke on your Big Mac"
there's actually a canadian slang term for sex that involves a canoe
guyz
that's great
what's the canoe one about sex?
whut game do I whant to play
You probably want to play Track Thunder Simluator v2
It's like trains
banana farming simulator 
but thunder
[7:21:58 PM] Brandon Worl: banana farming simulator 
no
let me see if i can find it
meh i cant find it
apparently 1 out of 10 canadians claim to have had sex in a canoe without capsizing though.
So there is a 10% chance you have done that
x.x
and a 90% chance she tipped over
capsized*
Yes
So a 100% chance of canoe
because thats how statistics works!
Canoes arent really a thing in calgary
[7:34:26 PM] Brandon Worl: because thats how statistics works!
Yes
Xd
I know I made up Stats MMIX
highest stats class you can take
^
Looks promising
wuuuut
why it gone
it's against the server rules to make afk farms i guess
idk
lol
and where does it say that?
i looked :F
idk
whelp, this is new
Macros that allow for actions being performed automatically while AFK, or perform actions much more quickly than normal
lol
i made a script that let me slice potatos at super speeds
now THAT would be OP
nah
cuz lag
it still takes the script like 4-5 seconds to slice a stack
oh really? lame
lol
a whole 4-5 seconds
lol
and then i have to manually move stuff around and retrigger the script
is that individually? or the whole stack at once
it spams left click
ah
too many rulez
ikr
not that i care
i havent played in a few days already lol
"no fun allowed"
we just need more bananas
who needs fun when you have bananas?
i wonder if that rule would include giant logging machines
i doubt it
well giant logging machines dont use afk macros
but
could your fancy piston thingy work with a giant logging machine?
pistons are broken
sooooooo
oh
right
lol
they break blocks
yeah
kinda hard to move logs around when they just break lol
seems like intended, lets ignore
it's a bug, saw it on their forums
:F
bugz
rulez
nopez
dayz
minez
warz
H1Z
z
ombeh
lol
i am bored
war thunder?
Yes
yes
yesyesyesyesyes
Your P-39 wants you
so, tomorrow I am touring Switch Supernap, the largest data center in North America, apparently
So you war thunder?
Also that place on Warm Springs
yeah
Okay lets play war thunder
i dont feel like war thoonder :l
nooooooooo
I am on wtfcraft
wat
wat
wat
?
wtfcraft wat
yes
as in
Thal's server
thal has a server?
Yes
its invite whitelist me thinks
sorta
do what you want
i didnt know such a thing existed
yes
I am building a small Japanese town
What the NSA headquarters? :P
It was probably more secure than the NSA HQ
there were armed guards following us and security doors at every intersection
lol
:l
someone else swooped in and did the thing I was working on yesterday
for this project
and already finished it
:l
lame
so now you have nothing to work on?
lol
I'll find something
lol
how did it feel to have people watching your every move?
lunch soon, then I'll be looking at the summer sale, then I'll find something to work on
oh yeah
summer sale
it was cool
shit
no walletz
:F
the level of security there was crazy
time to dip into savings
i bet
data = life nowadays
like full gear like SGA
damn
what kind of gun
That data center alone (They have 9 in vegas) takes as much power as 3 casions
just a pistol
walking around with p-90's "hmm, i'm guessing this isnt their day job"
the guy following us, at least
there was a thing that looked VERY MUCH like a stargate there
lol
lol
it works
go touch it
lol
and remember
8-digit code to get to atlantis
that would only work if they have a ZPM though
hey, 3x the power of a casino, what do you think they're using it for? obviously powering a charger for their ZPM, this is like 10 years after SGA
lol
good point
TIL SGA was a documentary
haha
dammit
what is my steam password
...
it's the short one with no punctuation
(had to lead off with that one since default is "the long one")
you've never seen me enter my steam password
lol
nope
i have not
BUT
i do know you have at least 5 different password choices
and one of them is bound to be "short with no punctuation"
lol
there is one that matches that description
see
told you
lol
and "the long one" also would be a definite option
so would "the one with underscores"
and "the one that's a sentence"
i have none with underscores or that are sentences
lies
truth
you definitely told me one of them was like a full sentence
well i guess one might be a sentence
see
it has an indefinite pronoun in it though
lol
so it isnt a very good sentence
who needs grammar?
lol
so if anyone notices dark souls II at more than 33% off, they should notify me immediately
even if that means driving to california to find me
the rule is, only buy if it is a flash sale, daily sale, or the last 2 days of the whole sale
is that the rule?
gkajsfkasj what is my damn password
it is
you get the best deals that way
gotcha
last 2 days everything comes back for the encore
gotcha
flash sales are guaranteed to be the lowest price too
I have tried every password
...
I logged in to steam like a month ago
i'm guessing you mis-entered something
well
i dont remember if the username is naosyth or jankypirate to log in
pretty sure it's janky
but i could be wrong
i remember you trying this last year
lol
i thought so too but i tried all my passwords on it
you can only reset passwords via the desktop app apparently
interesting
I cant access the download button x_x
it gives me a 403 forbidden message
oh well theres nothing on sale right now that I need to buy
I'll just set up a VNC server on my desktop so I can access steam through it at work
lol
lol
;
you should summarize that for me
havent watched it yet
lol
ooh people are going to caines for lunch
afk
lol
updated Kuban yayyyyyyyyy
no more unfairness
woo
If you did dial anything we wouldn't have seen you back alive :<
lol
i'm sure he would have been fine, the wraith are probably long dead by now
i dunno man, didnt seem that way in the first SGA book
lol
Gaben has started his sale
indeed
much excite
better than xmas
war thunder has 1.1 gb download
wat
so many sales
wat to be buying?
I dont see anything I have to buy yet
I might buy dayz
maybe
$?
it's 15% off, dont remember price
it's a daily sale though
so it wont be going any lower than 15%
or was it 30%
idk
it was like $15 i think
...hm
my hype kinda died down on that thing
yeah, it is full of bugs and has hhardly any features lol
skyrim for 24... werth?
if it isnt a flash or daily sale, wait on it
flash and daily are guaranteed to be the best deal
I am going to get skyrim + all DLC when it goes on flash/daily
legendary edition skyrim should be 29.99 for lowest price, that's what it's been the past two sales i think
by last two sales i mean christmas and summer last year
ah
hmmm
i can also pirate it....
for freeeeee
pirate is badong
yeah
well
so is war
lol
And communism
skyrim is one of those that I think is worth buying
yeah
Its worth $29
if it was like EA or ubisoft then it'd be different
easy
500 hours of gameplay
especially since using steam workshop mods in conjunction with nexus mod manager is easy, and steam ws has some convenient mods that nexus does not
so
(possible, with mod its goes on forever)
I got put on a different project now
what?
he said he got put ona different project now
Echo 360, it is a content delivery platform for universities
WOO first
lol
lol
ECHO ECHO echo echo echo .... .... ....
Derktors, 6:00 Ricardos tomorrow?
Basically you have courses and stuff, and they have presentations/videos/slides on there that you can view, take notes on, ask questions, etc
NO
WAIT FOR ME
lol
we'll jsut do it twice
get there by 6, and we will wait for you
win win
lol
i'll be in reno by 6
does that count?
tony
you have ruined me with your puns
Earlier today, driving back from lunch
my coworker was talking about taking her dog on hikes
she said her dog runs right up to the edge of clifs
she was saying "she just doesnt get...."
and I was totally expecting "... the gravity of the sitatuion"
but she ended up saying something like "the danger of steep cliffs"
ff
cliffs
:F
i know i know
lol
i fixed the last one
TWICE
TWIIIIIICE
after i looked up and saw it was wrong
lol
deal with the first one
DEAL WITH IT
silence!
deal with it
error: overloaded operator clif not found, suggestions are: cliff
too bad
lol
diel weth it
oh dear
lions and tigers and boars, oh my
oh me!
lol
the danger of steep cliffs
you should have said gravity
I was tempted
but
nobody likes puns
who cares about rocky relationships
puns ftw
stahp
lol
you're just driving yourself off a cliff now brandon
good
clif*
lol
bar
clif bar
the other f fell off the cliff
wow
This conversation took..... a dive
i can totally see that in animated letters
It went
down hill
fast
... I'm gonna get back to work now ... >_>
oh dayz is 15% off, and costs $25.49
not worth it
lol
ok those "recovery" workouts I'm all about
we have a "workout" room here
except we havent actually got any workout equipment yet
all thats in that room is video games
lool
I should workout in there more often
sounds like a good workout
(to be fair, it is at least a wii and not an xbox or something)
so you at least move your arms a bit
lol "workout"
i remember back in the day, we were temp members at a gym, and they had these bikes that powered n64s so you had to keep pedaling to play
lol
that's awesome
it's like dangling a carrot in front of a pig
and riding it too
so, my steam login info was the first thing I tried
and it worked the first time... kind of
it sent me the email with my code to verify the new location I was logging in from
but the actual website didnt give any feedback that it worked
Got Far Cry 3 Deluxe Edition
$10
reviews said it was Skyrim with guns
I've never played far cry
hell yah
skyrim legendary edition is the one with all of the dlc, yeah?
Yeah
Far cry is supposed to be really really good
legendary edition is 40% off, $23.99. Not even a flash/daily. So, it will probably be <20 at some point
i like how there's flow charts and stuff with strategy for the sale on reddit
Lol
lol yup
whoa
nao
half life 2 is two fiddy
saw that
reddit didnt seem to like it in the comments
lol
lol
already have all
they don't? Bummer :<
well I opened it and was like "well.....I don't really know how to use this"
lol
Reddit was mostly criticizing the issues that site has
like
derp alignments, bad fonts
the documentation is apparently bad
lol great
twitter bootstrap is apparently better and more well known
errybody uses bootstrap apparently
or foundation
... :<
maybe I should've started with those
They probably have a bit more of a learning curve than just doing it how you have been
I'm just using the Aperture Science method
you have to start out like that to learn the basic concepts
I've learned a few... a lot actually. Responsiveness used to scare me.
lol
the more i'm looking at my current site actually... the more I'm realizing that it's terrible for mobile
:/
you'll always see things you'd do different when you look back at a site you've made :p
:/
makes me sad
all this cool stuff
and for what?
for knowledge
I know I just feel like I completely skipped past the purpose for the site :/
well you can always make a V2
true...
I didnt even get email working
you didnt? I thought we got that sorted out
nope lol
well sorta
it sent
it just never said it sent
or if it did, it broke
so we moved on to teh gallery
but it was sending me emails
but remember what the website did?
it broke and had a weird message
oh, all we had to do was add feedback
thats like ezpz
@_@
Uhh...Friday?
I'm not in the mood today >_<
lol
fridas
si fridas
I don't even remotely want to buy anything on the from page
what about the to page?
lol

speaking of relax, after I eat dinner would people want to do some thor wundering?
lol
oh that explains it
front page
I thought you were tony at first
WAR THUNDER
yes
and was like "wat tony asking about war thunder
Nao

lol
right
but i want to do 3
so 3 it is
yay brandon is in!

no

wow, you can call to india for 1.5 cents/minute with skype
i can call india for 0.0 cents/minute with my cell phone
I don't call india

for some reason webgl doesnt work on my desktop
decosine
art thou reddeh
I just got back from target
I saw a wild niggress on a rampage
lol
i am in mumble if you wish to join
So in enemy groups of three I've been starting a new horrible trend
if I can headshot them all it's "Bibbidy" "Bobbidy" and "boop!"
lol
are you crime?
I am Effect
aha
i miss that game
$15 on origin
technically I paid $15 for 2 adn 3 since 1 broke to pieces
origin is the devil
^
it is indeed
that is why i only play mass effect on console
garrrr someone play wt i have new t3 planes to try outttt :F
i got Tomb Raider in that same purchase
werth
but tomb raider is on steam! (isnt it?)
yeah it is
but i'm pretty sure it still makes you use origin
oh
that makes me sad
aaaactually
THis is where it gets weird
Origin
gave me a Steam Key
after I downloaded TR
its like "here's the Steam Key you downloaded, go DL it again jerk"
"idgaf, STEAM!"
so it's only steam or both?
i think only steam
Maybe Square Enix is owned by Steam?
er, Valve?
no
more likely square enix isnt owned by EA
lol
i don't think origin would be so willing to share drm
EA stopped publishing its games to steam
bastards
of course it did
Thats why crysis 2 is on steam byt 3 is only origin
kek
crysis is published by EA
So, tomb raider must not be published by EA
Square Enix is the publisher
crystal dynamics (who is hiring btw) is the developer
apparently an ex-bungie employee works at originate
orly
that sounds like quite the career decision
lol
did he really think that one through?
lol
Originate's goal is to get every one of its employees at least 1 million dollars
so i mean
I could see why he'd join
1mil per year?
no
is that Origin Insider?
well i mean, you could be an employee for 40 years and then that 1mil is pretty slow
lol
new t3?
wuut
and EA actually has a great work environment
several
what plans
they take care of their own and have great marketing strategies
One of our new employees is an ex EA employee
it's just steam is bigger and better
aw snap
steam is small compared to EA
in terms of company size
steam also seems like a dream company to work for
b25j, p63, yak3p, la5fn, fw190 a-5
but, Originate is actually a pretty competitive company. We've got a few potentially super lucrative projects going on
and if any of those take off, originate will get a bunch of money and that money goes to the employees
lots o planes
indeed
decided to use my remaining eagles for lions, got 1mil lions, bought all the planes i had researched but not bought
yay
Ian
Ian
mumbleeee
bizaay?
skype puts that overlay over my game
I'll be back in a bit
hey brandog did you ever find that recipe for taco soup
oh
i tried to find it
but i have no clue where it is lol
lol
does your mom know possibly?
possibly, but she went to bed like 10 minutes ago
I can make taco soup
thats fine, i just need it by saturday
if you can find it that is
Did jammer leave mumble?
dont think so
i'm headed to bed
very sore and tired, need sleeps
:F
kk
cya
hi
halo
new steam sale stuff just popped up
vgh
lol aamfp
lol
nothanks
prison architect seemed fun
yeah it did
isnt it still an early access thing though?
isnt everything these days? :(
well yeah, but i'm trying to ignore things as being games if they're early access. tired of alphas and betas being shitty
it has.. a lot of expensive DLC
lol
nothanks
oh those all include the standard game
bound by flame looks cool
oh this isnt actually dlc
“Bound by Flame is like Mass Effect set in a Medieval fantasy world” 
GAMESRADAR
I ended up buying don't starve
apparently they plan on adding a free multiplayer DLC some time late summer
welp
half of the office is working from home today
and I am too new to this new project to figure out how to respond to these bug reports
sooooooooooo
i am bored
lol
i thought you already had dont starve?
no
i played the chrome version
ahhh
gotcha
is it worth it?
the chrome one was fun
it'd be fun as multiplayer
the art style is really kinda cool and creepy
yeah
I probably won't play it much till multiplayer is added though
which should be fairly soon
the multiplayer dlc will be public alpha some time late summer. so not full release, but it should at least be playable
nice
wow, rpg maker is pretty cheap for the actual software
the dlc is still 153 dollars for all of it and every single one is 75% off
game dev tycoon....
werth?
i quite enjoyed it
still play it from time to time
$4?
i bought it for like 10 and it was worth it
hi
hi
ehh dunno
dafuq
linkedin is in spanish for some reason
lawl
lol
i want dark souls 2
like
a lot
:F
lol
add it to your wishlist
I did
it's number 1
lol
skyrim is like $10 now
but it's not a daily...
gonna wait that one out
skyrim should definitely either be a daily or a flash sale at some point
legendary edition or whatever has the DLC
I am tempted to buy Spore.. but I've already played through it once. Not sure if it is worth $12 just to play the new DLC
tbh I don't think it would be worth it unless you are nostalgic
yeah. I'd most likely end up binge playing it for 1-2 days and then never touch it again
yeah
I think we should all get far cry 3
already got it
is there a multiplayer?
apparently there is but it sucks
aww
nao
hi
would you recommend doing that parallax scroll generic website that everyone else is doing?
maybe on a home page or something
beyond that it kind of is distracting
only use it if it is natural to have it, don't force your content to match the whole paralax thing
I was told I should add a bio, photo, and resume on my site
that would be a good idea
Still ricardo's at 6?
ji
si
the coop was what i thought looked cool on far cry
also the multiplayer didnt seem that bad
it seemed different for sure, but not bad
there's coop?
yay coop
For those interested SpaceX Falcon 9 will launch a satellite in 15 mins http://www.spacex.com/webcast/

consolation video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgLBIdVg3EM
lol aww
good part at 1:40
yeah :/
lol the cows in that video are like "nope fuck this i'm going to the other side of the pasture"
haha
then when it lands they're like "oh good, the pillar of the gods is back! back to the holy side of the fields"
even if I wanted to in ksp I would have run out of fuel or end up tilting sideways
what was that thing called, andrew? banana staging or something?
asparagus staging?
asparagus*
lol
if you use asparagus staging, then it's pretty easy to get in orbit
^
also if you use big engines
that helps
KSP
wooooo
I build fighter planes

mmm
Ricardos
in 1 hour
yes
ricardos
yes
ricardos
yes
whoa papers please is only $3
hm
what is papers please?
oh boy planet explorers is $15
What's that?
i bet $15 Shriker will make a post about the sale on GH
lol
some game Shriker is in love with
Paper Please is a game where you're an immigration officer and you have to determine if immigrants are qualified to enter your government
everything done correctly, you're paid
and you have a family to care for
if you mess up, you're docked
people will try to bribe you, some people must get through or else their country will put them to death
you balance morality with your government with your family
sounds interesting
very simple game
played it for a while
probably not gonna buy it
the demo was good though
hm
battleblock Theater
planet explorers might be worth getting on sale
but its one of those big promise early access games
mmmeh
Have you seen the trailer for BattleBlock Theater?
no
same makers of Castle Crashers and Alien Hominid
They're hilarious
I know I have to recreate my site
I just don't have the drive for it
blargh
ok change of possible plan
Apparently by saturday, May meant Saturday night at 8:30pm until Sunday
so what she meant was Sunday
-_-
lol
Possible movie Sunday?
sure
ok
@_@
sorry about that
np lol
afk for a bit
How was ricardos?
Muy Bueno
Also nao, I found a fully developed version of naospace. Check out freelancer, the last game by the star citizen dude. Looks and plays almost identically just with 10000 more hours of developing time
I want ricardos
I want dark souls 2 more though
According to my cousin risk of rain is well worth it at full price. So for two fiddy that's probably a good deal
...might try that
hi
hmm AC black flag
maybe I should buy that
lol terraria for $2
ooh skyrim legendary edition is $13.59
my wallet can feel the burn
vgh lol
Spintires?
wut
wat
DAMN SON
wut
dragon age too
damn son
I wonder if spintires is good
buying
spintires is good if you like offroading
you are buying spintires?
no
buying Dragon Age origins and Skyrim Legendary
Dragon age was fun
I've played the first two
Still no dark souls dammit!
lol
got origins and skyrim
what is dragon age?
Action rpg with a cool story and stuff
Should I actually get Terraria?
sure
Its fun
mmmmmmeh
meh
Starbound?
Star bound is decent but very short lived. Would be more fun with lots of friends and bosses and stuff that hasn't been balanced or added yet because beta
Terraria is really fun when we get into it. Every few months we mess around for a week or so. Definitely worth the two bucks or whatever it is
terraria is fantastic
definitely should get it considering it's so cheap
I still think $2 is 2 expensive for Terraria though :<
wat
Get Terraria.
well i got it
lol nao's "wat" convinced me
lol
It's a great game
i'm saving it for a rainy day when we all play it
i bought Assassin's Creed 4, Skyrim, and Prison Architect today
lol
almost bought black flag*
$20 for the main game
i decided against it
might play Mai's copy on her PS lol
I wasnt impressed by the first AC, but everyone always talks about how amazing they are
so I figured I'd try it
PIRATES
i would've
but i'm a cheapskate
lol
Apparently black flag is awesome because it's more pirate Sim than go around murdering millions of people
lol so I've heard
i really want that french rev one though
Brandone Cyanide & Happiness - Tortoise: http://youtu.be/FvdH32h5JfM
Also yes. French revo one looks awesome. Let them eat cake!
lol tortoise
so, what shall I play... skyrim, black flag, or prison architect
black flag
so then I can know if I should buy it
i agree
i will play once this video is over
While doing that look for skyrim mods to play with (HD mods would be amazing with your pc and I will probably be jelly[speaking of jelly, skyrim auto corrects to syrup on my phone])
lol
playing syrup legendary edition
lol
arma 2, deco? trying out dayz?
yup
Got convinced
Gonna try DayZ Epoch
Need someone to play with? :D
If I can get it to work
do you know if I need to install both arma 2 and arrowhead?
both have to be installed
I need summer adventure cards 2, 8, and 9
I sold 8 earlier
I have two extra 4's
so far black flag has been pretty fun
it's very similar in town to how the first one was, but there is much more variety outside of towns
+ the whole boat thing
deco, did you get dayz working?
i just finished installing arma 2
I got DayZ Epoch working
I think
Its messy
the whole thing
lol
You using dayz commander?
play with six
dayz commander is super easy
you just download it, then click install epoch
I got it running
lol
and then it will list epoch servers right there and you can join servers straight through dayz commander
It just feels sloppy
my epoch download is taking forever lol
this is a seriously slow download
epochly slow?
you could say that....
Nao: Die in the West or Edge of Tomorrow?
alternatively
How to Train Your DRagon 2
die in the west
cool
what time?
people require me to wipe their old computer at some point
which should be pretty fast
no idea
i assume afternoon
i'll see
k
Mai and her friend may join us
ok
download is at about 80 minutes in... just reached 50%. Total size is around 1.5 gb....
I've downloaded around 70gb of games through steam today lol
they said whenever
let me see if there's a certain time tomorrow I need to wipe that computer by
there is no time, and it may not happen till next weekend
so
i'm good any time
h'okay
deco
i finished installing epoch
I am doing TLU?
what is TLU? lol
Some roleplaying terroisty server
these controls are terrible
for ARMA
how do I join you?
I don't exactly know
one sec
probably be doing skype call
one sec
Most realistic thing about Mass Effect series
Spam messages.
i can't get epoch to work lol
I keep getting a bad version message
got it working

Any recommendations from this newest batch of sales?
nope
Apparently kingdoms of amalur is good. Good reviews as well
i like how all of the top reviews for amnesia:amfp are negative
wow space engineers has come a long way since I last saw it
Yeah its really pretty well done now
Glad I bought it when I did
BATTLEBLOCK THEATER
Lol
Knew that was coming as soon as I saw the sale
(]:
it's like castle crashers v2 apparently
*gasp*
COME ON PINK TEAM
COOOOOME ON
did you see the trailers?
i giggle every time
lol daily deal ends it 46hrs
ok steam
is anyone else getting that?
Maybe. Trying to save funds for dark souls 2
Only other game I plan on getting is space engineers
and maybe cs:go
lol
Space engineers is fun. We should do a server play some time
Cs:go just seems so... counterstrike. Never really been a fan
space engineers looks awesome
O look
Planetary Annihlation is finally a reasonable price
Lol yeah but just think how cheap it'll be once it's finished. It's still in a raised beta price
lol I wasn't planning on buying it still
why would I buy another incomplete game?
lol
Indeed. It does look like a promising game when it is a finished product
I  can hope
It'd be nice if someone finally finished a game though
Yes it would. Makes you wonder if the whole early access thing really helps or improves the games being made these dats
*days
hi
yes, we should all do space engineers some time
Indeed. I keep it updated just in case you fellas get into it suddenly lol
I won't be back in Internet for a week though
Speaking of which,  if any of you sees dark souls 2 go on sale while I'm afinternet you should 100% text me so I can run to the bakery and steal their Internet for purchases
i'll let you know if I see it go on sale
so tony, next showing is at 4:15
then 7, and 10
probably 7 or 10
most likely 7
k
Danka. According to /r/summersale it won't go below 33% (they're guessing) but one can hope. When is the last day of the sale?
the 30th
Oh cool. I'll be back in Internets by then
So if it doesn't go below 33% off I can still get it at the end
Ich habe space engineers
gonna wait for it to go deeper sale
oh nao
nao nao
A lot of these "Early Access" games I'm guessing aren't going to see full development.
What's the drive to complete a game if people will gladly pay you for something unfinished? I get that it's cool that there's beta testing and all but...eh
exactly
fuck yeah pink team
damn pink team is really dominating today lol
bout that time eh chaps
oh yes... it appears to be
i have to mash my face full of lasagana
but dont let that delay you
ooook
we'll head over in 15ish
wut
head over whenever, i'm shutting down now
lol k
Brandon
that felt wrong
that felt soooo wrong
which one of you wise guys is Sumgaya Inda Marquet
I gotta discount for ya.
Some guy in the market? Lol that is genius
Knew it was you.
Your discount:
Half off
a knuckle sandwich
I'm just gonna poke your eyes out.
lol really though I giggled
Lol
Bought dark souls prepare to die, figured I should probably actually buy it lol I just have the pirated version and I'm in the middle of playing it. Also getting risk of rain and awesomenauts because cheap
lol
I was about to tell you about dark souls
i might get ftl
but then again I might not
^debating
I almost have all of the summer trading cards
just missing one, dont remember which
?! I have a -25% pixel piracy coupon
what even is that
made by the makers of terraria
it is a 2d side scrolling pirate game
hm
it is fun, but early access. not a whole lot of content yet
Also not totally balanced at this point
how do you get to your summer cards?
I eventually got to the point where I was unhurtable lol
inventory
click a card
then click view badge progress
I'm missing #8
I have two 7's though, so I can sell one when I get home
and then I'll be able to get 8
i don't know which ones are summer cards though
idk what happens when you get all of them
they have a yellow(orange? green? idk) bottom
I'm gonna go with orange
final answer
i see it
is it orange?
you just need #8?
Yeah
I got 2
I'll trade you a #7
i'm down
but i still need like.... a lot
lol
lemme figure out how to trade
ugh lol
cant trade from this computer
gotta wait 7 days to trade after signing in from a new device
error sending trade offer
whaaat
what did the error say?
maybe it's just under load
and needs to be resent
"Error sending trade offer."
I'll wait until later
lol helpful
you have to go into friends, make trade, etc.
yeah, just wait till i get home
I probably cant accept it from this laptop either
... my laptop's camera turned itself on when I was adjusting settings, and now it won't turn itself off
it is spying on me
o.o
"I'm afraid I can't let you do that Bran."
I just killed the main process
take that, spying camera!
lol
Lol
Now I just need dark souls 2
so a friend I told about our little Doctors group said we should make a League on LoL
I agree :<
buuuut I also know I've barely convinced one of you lol
it is an interesting game but I have no desire to play it
lol
yeaah :<
can't get a good team together
all I have are sle-fcentered nublets
Several gamerhaus people play it
any I know?
umm
i dont know who exactly off the top of my head
is ther e a sub for it?
I know a guy from college whose friend played on our GH server who plays LoL and I think is good at it
all I want is a team who won't rage at loss or when things go wrong
lol
LoL just isnt the kind of game I get in to and want to play a lot of
I like sandbox games
lol
Or certain shooters, or horror games
orite I need to set that up
but those are mutually exclusive
i dont like shooter horror
Who will be doing the actual amnesia playing?
do we have someone who won't fabricate exagerated reactions to every little detail or go excrutiatingly slow?
who hasn't already played
lol yeah
Anthony and Sarah most likely
Migi might fabricate reactions but she could just be naturally overexpressive
but they both have an interest and a genuine desire
they're not attention whores since we deal with them every time at faire
They're also competent enough to know that "pull" means pull
lol
in the heat of the situation, pull and push have no distinct meanings!
lol
same with left and right
I've gotten to the point where I can basically do the water level without missing a beat :(
the fear is gone
Sometimes I do stupid stuff to attract the monster just to scare the people watching me play
lol
gameplay trailer of Frictional Games' new project
When I played outlast with Alex and her dad and brother I purposefully went to spots I knew would be jump scares and near deaths just to scare them lol
lol
lol we're gonna give control to those who enver played it
unless they of course can't continue
then we force them to continue!
that's when it gets good
I had a dream I met the band members of Within Temptation at Walmart
I asked them for an autograph
all I had on me was a 3x5 index card and one of those thin tipped sharpies
I considered having them sign my TI-84 but I thought that would be weird
weird?
as in it wouldn't
B)
make any sense?
i dont get it
damn you're not indoctrinated enough
as in it wouldn't
B)
add up?
see that makes more sense
lol
i dont see how "sense" relates to calculators
it doesn't
wat
then
wat
sometimes I reverse pun people
like
why
we were looking for steel in a Lowes
why would you do that
someone was hoping they'd have a good price
and I said, "So you're looking for a...."
*evil glare*
"Bargain?" *troll face*
oh
lol
I see
they make up the pun in their own mind
either way the hatred is the same
I was just expecting the pun
I've just gotten so good at puns that people connect them usually if I lead up to it
but I'm bad at puns
lol no
You can't expect me to finish a pun
you almost said the dog didn't understand the gravity of the situation
lol
that's practically a pun that builds itself
Or maybe you just happened upon an area that builds puns for you
Not sure if puns can build themselves, since puns aren't alive... #smartpeoplethings

so I finally got my magnet pen/stylus the other day
but the magnet triggers the auto screen on/off on my tablet
so the stylus part is kinda useless lol
FTL is worth $4
for sure
Ftl is awesomesause on tablet
woo ME2
Wut? No flash sales or community sales?
they'll show up
also..... WOO GO BLUE TEAM YEAH
my bathroom smells like chicken pot pie
lol
I'm wondering if they have it games so that one team wins per day?
it seems that way
brb
Ah. They showed up. Nothing good other than possibly planet explorers but nah too expensive
i voted for garry's mod for $2.50
we should all get gmod and do mini games
i have gmod
we should play some TTT
wazzat
it's great fun
gmod game
If it gets voted for I will buy. Apparently game dev tycoon modding is becoming a thing
space engineers modding is also a thing
which might be cool
lmao this episode of TTT is hilarious
...huh
i'm down
isnt it great? lol
haven't really watched it
well
WATCH IT
i've been skipping through the thing
at ~8 minutes it was pretty funny
also when guude dropped milbee down the stairs
that was funny
wait, these are teh same people?
these are the mindcrackers
ahah
Trouble in Terrorist Town
I think I'm missing some jokes
ok that's interesting
now i get the gamepla
that would be fun as hell
but who would we play with
we'd need at least 5-6 people
i played with zipperdude and some other GH people a few months ago
ok that sounds fun
you know anyone else who has gmod?
any of the payday crowd or anyone?
dunno
doubtful but I can chec k
Isn't space engineers modding just adding custom blocks with different shape/size/color at the moment? I know they were working on a modding api and support for it but I didn't know it was out already
it is mostly adding blocks, but they can have special behavior i think
I bought it
so if you guys want copies, I can give two
that looks fun as hell
i'm down
it's like assassins right?
I can give you a copy when I get home
I dunno, but it sounds fun, especially with everyone in mumble
huh, nidhog
it's actually on sale
what is nidhog?
nidhogg
it's a 1v1 2d fencing game
won a lot of awards apparently
it's over $5
I want space engineers to go on a flash/daily sale already
yeah..
so i clicked on the link for GH
went to GD
and saw rJay's "Any 9/11 enthusiasts out there?"
lol
mega face palm
he's so strange
he's denser than spongecake
he's the most ccringe-inducing person i've ever met
and he is totally oblivious to that
lol
it's like watching a train wreck in slow motion
those damn pirate songs from Black Flag are stuck in my head
lol
that's something I've heard a lot a bout
lol
Apparently I can play the Kenway's Fleet thing from my tablet
I just sent all of my ships out on trade/combat missions
and made a bunch of money for when I get home
lol
lol wow
so we had a tech lunch scheduled for today
where the various offices get on a big call and there's a presentation and lunch
but
the presenter bailed
so now it's intern lunch
lol
where interns talk about what we've been doing
and I'm the only intern in this office
>_>
and everyone already knows what I do
lol
lol
"so yeah I figure to keep in the spirit of things and since we only have two interns/new hires, we'll just put them on the spot because that's fun"
- my boss
lol
lol
that wouldn't be alex would it?
yes
Classic Alex.
lol
I don't even know the guy but he's bloody classic
lol
we're making a new employee handbook here, apparently based on valve's lol
awesome
The ship looks pretty sweet
Very entertaining at least. How does one attain a copy?
i can send you a copy when I get home
Cool beans, how'd you get three? Lol
If I bought nidhogg would I have people to play with? >.>
such vacation, very sore, much muscle pain. Wow.
Lol
What did you do?
Playing wiffleball baseball
Also, running on the beach :)
Mostly baseball though
Very nice. I just went golfing, pretty tired
Heh that'll make you sore XD been a loooooong time since I've gone golfing :(
Yeah been like a month for me. Much longer when it's not summer though. That's kinda my thing when summer comes around
The game comes with 3 copies when you buy it, andrew
and when I give people copies, they get an extra to give out as well
so it is basically a 5 pack
dude that's awesome
Wow
That is a good way to promote your game lol
no joke
that's like anti-dlc
lol
compiling for daysssss
fjfuasjhfkjluashfkja all that and then it errors!
fml
lel
hi
hi
hrm what to do
compiling scala takes forever x_x
Eww.  Long compile times suck.
it's compiling 341 test sources
I think there's several thousand tests for it to compile
Wow
That is large
yeah
Like... 10 minutes or what?
i dunno
didnt notice when i started it
still isnt done
it might be stuck... idk
im afraid to stop it and then it turns out it really is just super slow and I have to go through all of this again
If not The Ship, I'd like to try out Risk of Rain
with anyone else who got it
do images need closing tags?
I don't remember off the top of my head
I'd assume not
oh self terminating
that was super derp
It makes sense that it doesn't need it
that's right it's teh p that threw me off
ok
since there is no data that you would put inbetween opening and closing tags
afk for a bit. gotta get my car smog checked/go home
I got risk of rain tony. But I won't be back til sunday
I don't even know how that game works.
tony
you should cancel that other trade offer
I can't cancel it on my end and it is forcing me to always appear to have 1 new message in my notifications >_<
lolk
uh
weird
it says it's not active
says that for me too
and I can't find any way to delete it
can you disable alerts or somesuch?
by the way
anyone who doesn't have bastion
get bastion
soooo get bastion
fun game, great story, glorious music
World of goo is also amusing
Liked bastion. Transistor is the bastion devs new game and it looks awesome
I'm waiting on Transistor to be on sale D:
beautimous soundtrack as always
okay
so
thal messaged me an hour ago about playing The Ship but I was at dinner
anyways
I have two copies to give
so
YO
anyone here right now who ok hi tony
anyone else?
I think ap is
i know he expressed interest
but of course he's afk
he's also away from good internet/computer I think
and these copies include free copies
orite
so he could still get one
lol yeah
i sent you a copy tony
WOO
I am on le skypes
hi
Hilo
i think he wants The Ship
Lol
are you able to play?
orite sunday D:
lol I can give you my copy if need be Andrew
Yeah sunday, can't now
there's a bunch of us on mumble
mumble mumble mumble
are you all playing the ship?
a bunch of people just lewft, not sure how many are still playing
apparently nobody is
>_<
might be worth checking out the tutorial
apprently that also shows up on the Steam grid
lol i wandered around like an idiot
I eventually figured out how to grab a pool stick and beat people over the head with it
lel
Kek
;p;
Iel
That bugs me
The first character is a capital I
Erl
I
Goddamnit
i
There we go
Auto correct ruining my day :F
Heil
Hitlah
nao
wanna try the ship together
Risk of Rain is interesting.
the most common video card registered on steam statistics is Intel HD Graphics 4000 lol
Naaooooo
^?
any of those games?
no tengo risk of rain
i think we'd need more people for The Ship
you and I can't try joining an existing server?
how many players are usually on the ship?
do we know 8 peeps with the game?
I know we'd be like 5
?
you me possibly ap and deco
and/or m31
depending on who's more likely to play it
ap is away from internet
i know that
so
I don't mean tonight
well not after that little exchange
well, there's a ton of GH people
oh
who have it
Dammit dark souls 2 why u no sale yet?
Literally the only other game I have interest in buying this sale season refuses to go lower than 33%
meanwhile other games are on sale for like the third time. lol
I know lol
D: bastards
nnnnnnng
ksp is %40
nnnnnnnnggggggg
today is national catfish day, log cabin day, and strawberry parfait day
weird
Also 64 years ago today was the start of the Korean War
so i've been fixing layout bugs all day for Echo360
my conclusion: IE is STILL terrible
even IE 11
No one uses it still
except old people
and they all use IE7
Yes
Its all about that netscape navigator
come on
but really though. IE supposedly follows standards now, but then they go and add extra crap that is IE specific that you have to explicitly disable to achieve a uniform look on all browsers
like, password fields automatically get an eye icon added that you can click to toggle between seeing dots or actual characters
no other browser has that
why bother with that
yyyyyyyyyyyyy
it is also terrible at resizing images
so this logo looks like crap on IE
IE y u do dis
IE don't know
tony I think you'd appreciate this: http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/qc/yelled_and_swore_at_a_nasty_customer_i_lived/
oh my god
*slow clap*
lol
I felt such amazement and awe when I read "I AM THE GODAMN MANAGER"
love it
lol
Space engineers is an option for the next community choice vote thing :D
OOOOOOH YES DO IT
supposedly if i send you a trade and then cancel it, it will fix that trade notification thing
so
ok
i won't accept
i am going to send you a trade
"You cannot trade with Mezalyth"
wat
@_@ what
maybe if you send me a trade and then cancel it
sent
trade cancelled
wooo the notification is gone :D
lol
Lol so steam problems
Very lol
Wow
we need to photoshop andrew doge
"Mez needs to photoshop andrew doge"
is what you meant right
basically
deco would accidentally make hitler doge if he tried
"accidentally"
he can't help it!
speaking of photoshop, I dont have it on this computer yet
"Ian, about your plus signs on these equations." "..."
oh, so
weird IE problem I had earlier today
It was defaulting this thing to display: table for some reason
no clue why
but
that caused the clock icon to become some random chinese character
....lol
oh, so ksp vs...that other thing
space engineers
ksp vs se
which?
welp
they are very different
Get both
you played the ksp demo right?
yeah
did you like it?
mmmmeh
fun for a quick bit
lol
It's a game you have to really get in to
KSP is about the mods
and like, really get familiar with it to fully enjoy it
it's very rewarding when you successfully pull of your first manned mission to another planet
but that takes a LOT of trial and error
so if that sounds fun to you, get ksp
space engineers I haven't played
but it seems awesome, is getting tons of cool new stuff, and i like making space ships
Space Engineers is still quite derp
it also has native MP support unlike ksp
and has funky controls
But
Yes
Multiplayer
buggy at the moment, but it is.. better than the ksp mod, for sure
lol
KSP is getting native multiplayer (soon[tm])
soon[tm]
(so probably in like september or october)
Yeah. KSP mp is weird
Space engineers is functional at least
i just want to build a giant cool space ship
andrew helped design it
lol
I want big cool space ship
afk
Me3
i didn't realize assassin's creed and watch dogs took place in the same universe
I just hacked a computer in black flag and it was talking all about Blume and ctOS. Even had an image from watch_dogs in it
lolwat
that's neat
that's very neat
Wooo
KSP
So
Turning in transonic flight is bad
lol why
Your plane will shake apart
lol
Violently
KSP
Should really be called
Soviet Space Program Simulator
lol
*boom* NEXT
Exactly!
You get good eventually though
so guys
space engineers sale ends in 18 minutes
I haz. Anything good in this new set?
Ooh. Dishonored: very recommend. Don't get the doc though, not worth it. It just gives you stuff that makes it easier to win, and the challenge is the fun part
god dammit
why did they have to put it on sale from like 2am to 10
srsly
lol
it'll probably go on sale again
when doe sthe sale end
oh 30th
end of the month
black flag is 50% off again
IE is terrible
lol
I was playing black flag multiplayer with hippos last night
he said he not only uses but LIKES IE
D: er ma gerd
*little girl scream
lol
IE... haven't used that in ages now
I only use it when working on web page design to make sure it works in IE
(spoiler alert: it never works in ie)
^
What do people use these days to make webpages?
like text editor wise or technology wise?
like text editor
Just programming oriented text editors
Sublime is quite popular
some people use vi/vim but they are crazy
Sublime and notepad++ and yeah vi/vim is just sadistic lol
vi/vim is supposedly super nice once you get the hang of it
Or masochistic, one of the two
especially if you have to jump between text/console a lot
Yeah I've heard that as well
But it's just so derp
hmm
lol
using h,j,k,l as arrow keys is just terrible
Tempted to get so many games but I need to save for ds2 :(
lol
I've bought every game I wanted to get
so now I will hopefully stop draining my wallet
lol
Want to save 50 bucks for the game and the dlc, and want the game to drop low enough that that covers it
how much is it regularly?
40 with no discount
33ish with the 33% off it currently has
The season pass for dlc is 25
If it hits 50% off I'm jumping on it so fast
I am quite excited to play space engineers when I get home
Me too
Sunday
Lol
man, Gimp is so bad compared to photoshop
oh
I just got an email
I guess tomorrow we start talking about the independent project thing at Originate
where we work on a project of our own 20% of our time
so I need to come up with a (reasonable) project
everyone is gone
watching soccer
there are two people in this room which usually has 13
also watching soccer
Soccer is lamw
*lame
If the US and Germany tie today, they both win/advance. How is that fun?
xD
Lol
It's easy to see that the usa is not a soccer playing nation XD :x
Every time someone says soccer is exciting for the entire game, I come back to an exciting moment in soccer: the fastest goal ever made. On the kickoff, some guy kicks it in for a goal, took like two seconds. The game ends 2 hours later 1-0
I would have watched the first two seconds of the game and enjoyed it. Lol
xD
not all games are exciting
woo 1 card left for the summer sale badge
which one?
I have a few doubles, maybe I have it
lemme check
Summer adventure card #2
nope, no #2
I have 1, 7, 8, and 9
(if anyone needs any of those)
ah
got 1 vote left for another card
got any duplicates?
I sold a few of mine and used the money to buy the ones I was missing
I sold my duplicates
did the same
What are these cards? I haven't even seen them or anything lol
you get trading cards when you do summer sale stuff
Probably because I'm on mobile
every $10 you spend
voting
Ah. I probably have a lot then
Lol
every 3 votes = 1 card
Voted 16 times and bought 25 bucks worth I think
scoring points for your team also gets cards
I've spent like... probably around $80 :x lol
I don't think I have a team
you get a card for joining a team too
I shall do that Sunday then. Good thing I have a few days with Internet before ending the sale lol
lol
I'm googling how to INSTALL the Ask toolbar on Chrome
every result is people asking how to remove it
lol
doesn't it come with java?
I think so
I'm afraid to touch java lest I break something
this whole project runs on the JVM lol
ah
your indidpendent project, nao?
no
I was asking if you had an idea for it, sorry
oh
lol
no
want ideas?
in a bit, testing why the ask toolbar breaks this website
the ask toolbar is terrible
thats why it breaks the site
anyone who uses it deserves to have broken sites
ticket closed
lol
it straight up changes the original site's css
it adds position: relative to <body>
that breaks a bunch of absolutely positioned elements
so terrible
oh wow
ok Battleblock theater
the guy narrating the trailers narrates the game
adds a nice little something
Anything good in newest sales?
Strike vector looks neat
Strike Vector: Sky Hawken?
ok this is sketch
guy contacting me for possible job
I'm interested
but it's "Adapp Solutions LLC"
results 2 and 3 when I google that is "www.ripoffreport.com"
thoughts?
also, ctrl+A on the homepage
"Face" comes out of nowhere
lol wat
what's with the face
i have no idea
I was selecting things to see if it was text or just an image and I saw FACE
what would you be doing for adapp?
Layering images and running them throug a program to make them clickable
Image mapping I'm guessing.
Advertising.
The work they showed me wasn't impressive so it's something I could do
for the right amount of course
there's apparently a hackathon coming up in august for developers, designers, etc
in vegas
to generate free content for startups around here
might be a good way to meet people and make connections
huh
maybe
aug 8 - 10
it's actually happening in the same building where Originate is, too
hm
you going?
i dunno
maybe
"team name"
team originate. I could ask if you could sign up under that team
you'd probably be able to
o.o
they'd let me?
probably, cant say for sure
I didn't know originate was going as a team
team scybreak yaaaay *waves tiny blue flag*
If I could that'd be awesome but I'm not expecting anything
I was actually gonna see if you wanted to team up :P
lol
not even sure of the benefit/point
besides the fact that self-picked teams are cool
benefit/point of teams or of the whole thing in general?
teams
._.
there you go
space engineers on sale for the next 24 hours
vgh some of us are getting together on T2
I'm at work D: can't get on
how much is it on sale for?
D:
vva
33% off, around $14
13.39
not bad, got to order a new laptop fan though xD
who all is getting on t2?
currently mr.humans, sergeantspears, doe, zipperdude
On the TC server?
it was zipperdude who started it
vgy
I could hop on IRC then
cool
do you know the irc channel info? lol
I thought it was #tribesnext but I guess not
vvw :P
irc.tribalwar.com #the_construct
vvt
vva
oh man transistor
...Deus Ex...worth it?
it was fun
played it a few years ago
how much is it?
$5
i'd say it's worth that
fun campaign
ok I'm getting Space Engineers, Transistor, and Deus Ex
oh 1 TB HD how I love you
lol
My 120gb SSD is over half full :(
I used I think a ...hold on
yeah 120 SSD for boot and native programs
yeah
1tb for games, pics, etc.
I'm always worried about running out of space
windows reserves a giant chunk of space on my SSD for hibernation/sleep
which is kinda annoying
I think I went with 2tb for the other drive
which makes an annoying clicking sound
which is probably a bad sign
o.o yeeeaah maybe
lol
the ironic thing is, I got this brand because it has the fewest HDD failures
So, I think a fun project to work on for that 20% thing would be, a web app that visualizes the data collected by your phone on a daily basis
Go on?
stuff like accelerometer/gps data interpreted to plot your movements over time
i.e. from 1:37 to 1:54 you were running
then you sat still for 3 hours
etc
huh
also you could chart battery usgae, data usage
phones collect a lot of information
that would be cool
you could then use that data to figure out if you can use an app to use certain sections
you could visualize when, plotted against time/day/month you are on phone calls most often
you could generate an activity index to show how much more or less active you were between two points in time
that'd be cool
also maybe tell stuff like how much your battery has degraded since the phone was new
there's a lot of interesting data
Very cool.
The web app itself could just be an API that accepts data in a certain format
so it wouldnt be limited to just phones
you could hook special sensors up to an arduino or something and stream data to the site
and tell it how to plot it
I've fixed all of the styling bugs on this project and am now without anything to do
do your data thing
there's a meeting at 2 involving that
so, I have over 400 subs on youtube now lol
noice
so nao
say you're styling height, width, and position
would you order them like
H
W
P
or
H
P
W
?
depends on if you're doing alphabetical or grouping by function
just stick to one method
doesn't matter which
sublime can also auto alphabetize selected lines
lol
lol
bandit?
silly tony isn't 'in' with our 'emoticons'
oh lol
tony has an idea!
nah
battleblokc theater: not all that's cracked up to be :<
not bad for the cheapy though
...I think I have everything I want from steam
LA noire worth it?
I just want ds2.  That is all. Thank you gabeN
LA Noire is good
Will I play it over war thunder or other multi player games?
Probably not
let me know when you can risk of rain
or spess engineers of course
Well then I no buy. That was my motivation for saving money lol
Sunday night probably
Brandoni
hi
Want to play a game?
depends
perhaps andrew can be joining us?
this sounds like you are about to say war thunder
Well
Not necessarily
we could play Takistan Life
That Arma II thing
or something else
I dunno
lol
I am just bored
lol
maybe I just play Kerbal
cause
such space
wow
I can't join til Sunday jeez do you even lift/ read chat?
DO U %2 LIFT?!
lol
No
Why is that?
There were like 200 messages
no spess engineers? :<
I haz spaceee engineers
perhaps space engineears tomorrow
ok
I can play?
yes
bed tim
ok so
anyone who doesn't have gmod
it's $2.49
vgrt
vva
so my grandma stayed here last night
this morning, my entire computer setup was unplugged
D:
lol
fan mk II?
?
isnt she the one that constantly turns on/off the fan?
oh, yeah
lol
thing is, my computer was asleep
so
o.O
the only visible power usage was the 3 blinking little blue LEDs on my monitors
two of which were hidden from sight from the doorway
so she unplugged my entire computer because of one flashing blue led
she knows* in before eil ai
lol
evil**
lol
so, anyone have space engineers and feel like playing?
later
@ian I am away from Internet and computer so I cannot play things til tomorrow
don't have it can't run it
got to replace my laptop fan xD
I want tooooooo :(
just buy a bunch of compressed air cans and tape the trigger down and point them at your laptop
that ought to work
i've got a standing fan pointed at it too reduce the load on the internal fan untill the replacement comes in
to*
so ment, looking forward to the netherlands spanking mexico in the world cup?
lol vgy
netherlands and germany were my two bets for finalists :P
let's see if it holds up
alright
many strong contenders for the cup
indeed
brasil, germany, netherlands, chile
not sure if I see the usa going up against brasil :s
but they are still in the game!
vgrd
us vs belgium doesn't look like a strong matchup for us
though one of their starters /did/ get red carded
we'll see
yeah
spess?
crime?
Anyone down for crime?
I want to crimeeeeee mannn tomorrow this time I'm gonna be Ballin so hard on these games you won't even know what hit you
lol
lol
so, CS: Source is $10
but if you buy gmod + CS:S you get it all for 6.24
I already bought gmod separately though :/
well you can still buy that and just have an extra copy of gmod
yeah but what would i use cs:source for anyway?
a $4 discount
you need it for like 90% of TTT/Murder/Prop Hunt maps
on gmod
oh really
okay, i will then
btw i'm home now
:F
woo
you should spess engineers with us later
so i can play as soon as i'm unpacked and done swimming, it's like 100 out already
^
lol
steam doesnt want to open >.>
wow this Daedalus I downloaded is SLOW
i think i know the one you speak of
it is indeed
watched a guy do ship reviews for a while, and most of the replicas are really slow
it goes straight fairly fast, but every other axis is terrible lol
hard to find spots to put engines in since SE works different than the engines supposed to be in the thingies
lol
we totally need to dogfight
we do
lol
yes
we should do a survival thing like guude and those guys though
we should have weapon limits though
it seemed really fun
yeah. limit to 1 reactor, 2 chainguns/missile pods
small craft are fun
btw SE doesnt like if you keep alt tabbing every 20 seconds :F
lol
afk for a bit
yeah that's been a problem for quite some time lol
it's gotten way better, used to be that every time you alt+tabbed it crashed and corrupted your save
lol i'm starting my fighter ship
gyro limit?
gyros make dogfights fun
ok
no jet limit, right?
if they still work the same as before it shouldnt matter, but with a 1 reactor limit you shouldnt be able to have too many
with such a small craft it shouldnt be hard to get it to max speed with small engines anyway
You guys talking space engineers?
yeah
i will go get a haircut now and when I get back build my fighter
How do you save craft?
I can't figure that out
you can save world files to the steam workshop
oh
idk if you can load ships between worlds though
so we should probably all build them on the same world
afk
how much is SE?
$13
*sigh* being broke sucks... guess ill have to wait for next paycheck
you can copy and paste
ctrl c ctrl v
and worlds are saved
So
Jeb Kerman
has been my test pilot for 500 flights
without dying
and only like 340 of those were near death expiriences
I don't know hot to build good ships
gonna be out for don't know how long
ineed cards 3, 8, 9, 10 for the summer sale badge :F
andi have an extra 1,4,5,6
now i only need 3 and 9
i need 2, 5, and 10
I have extra 1, 6, 8, and 9
i only need a 3 now
been buying/selling for 1 cent difference
lol
i have 4 cards i could sell, 3 i need to buy
should work out
yeah definitely, just put them all up for 13 cents and buy the ones for 14
moving that giant safe from my garage to my parent's closet was quite a bit of work
lol
whelp, got them all
and made a little bit of money on top of that
like 20 cents
lol
lol
so I deployed this battlestar's side pods too quickly
and almost ripped them off the ship
o.o how
and i'm now flying all over the ship repairing it lol
lol
how did they almost rip off?
i gave them too much gas
lol
want to mp?
sure. i can host
yay
mumble?
yeah
spess?
we were into space
i'd ready to do more spess whenever
I am aboot to haz dinner
I made gumbo
spess?
lemme get to this objective in ass creed
then spess
ok
i play a little dark souls but when you guys hop on mumble i'll spess

y r i up so earlyyyy :F
so andrew, I finished the mining ship last night
yay
does it work?
yeah
has a few issues, but it works
easy fixes too
sweet
wat dat
cyanide/happiness
much funny
sfw too
so probably nsfw
oh
lol
lol
yeah
this one is okay
so if I were to turn my volume full blast without headphones and play this in the middle of the office while other people are on a call with a client, I'd be fine?
woo
lol
i want to play more space engineers
lol yeah you'd probably be fine
they'd be like "wtf are you watching"
lol
but not like "wtf, you're watching THAT? At WORK?"
i want to play more spess as well
the mining ship can dock on the red ship and dump its entire inventory
it's really convenient
that would be really convenient
lol
you can also do that with collector/dropper thingies
we mined like 5000kg of iron last night with it in a few minutes
damn
we need a refinery ship now
red ship
lol
with multiple parallel refineries
i wonder if conveyor belts are smart enough to split stuff in a parallel system
i dont think they are
but they will toss things in the next open container
so if the container (refinery) fills up, then they will go to the next one
well, we're nowhere near advanced enough to need multiple refineries lol
lol
once i get mining, there's gonna be a backlog of refinery so bad that you'll need to call the space plumbers
lol
We'll probably build another mining ship soon
improved with what we learned from the first one
like.. you don't even need a collector
lol
yeah i found that out this morning as well
lol
collectors are for depositing things
like
they pick up items
i forget what they're called
yeah
ejectors
yes
them
yeah
lol
connectors are more convenient
you can also eject out of a connector
just dock, and then in the terminal you can access the docked ships inv
connectors, when set up with a proper conveyor setup, basically merge the inventories
and let you move anything anywhere in both directions on the conveyor system
an ejector would still be nice on the mining ship though
to toss out all that stone
stone is kinda useful
yeah but do we really need 40k kg of it? lol
because we have 40k kg
gotta be careful when ejecting things, since you can kill people with the debris
or was it 70k kg
lol
wow
lol
so
i killed deco again last night
i bumped in to him in the hallway
sent his dead body flying in to space
lol
he had a ton of uranium on him
and cobalt
oboy
cobalt is hard to find
lol
we didnt have any in that giant asteroid
i'm sure we'll find some with the new mining ship
shame we can't add asteroids
yeah, makes me wonder what happens once we've mined them all out lol
it'd be fun to play in a super dense asteroid belt
with meteor showers
so, now that we have a mining ship, what should we focus on next?
i kind of want to build a modular cargo freighter
where each cargo module can be undocked from the main carrier and moved around
I realized last night that we can set up an Ender's Game Arena
that would be awesome
lol
lol
Knew you'd like it
I think next we need a vehicle that can disable turrets
yeah
for those armed escorts
also a build ship would be nice
basically just a small ship with a cargo hold and welding/grinding tool
so we can stop running back and forth so much
lol
that would be cool
oh also
apparently
that military transport is rigged to blow if you reverse it
o_O
there's a warhead in front of a reverse thruster that'll destroy the cargo hold and hangar
haha
I wonder if we could make a two-seater fighter
where the second person is a gunner
dunno
with some sort of swiveling 360* gun
lol rotors are like "motors"
yeah
that'd be really cool if we can
hm
well
you can't controll it
but
I've thought about making like a helicopter-ish module
where the top just spins and shoots
lol
oh you CAN set limits
it's just not controllable
can you bind them to keys?
but you can make gates apparently
i don't thnk so
i saw a robot that had like walking legs
like, with working knees and stuff
oh wow
oh my god wait maybe you can control turrets
er
rotors
even if it is just a left/right keybind, that'd be cool
i guess for a rotor turret to be useful you'd need left/right/up/down
and that would be basically impossible to aim while moving
but who carese if you can't hit when you have a turret that cool
that should actually be super easy
to bind up/down/left/right?
not bind
i don't think you need to bind it
how's it work?
the difficulty i think would lie in getting it to control the turret only
i'm gonna fire up creative and test some things
do rotors just automatically move via mouse?
if this video is to be believed yeah
we could always make the turret another vehicle that just mounts on to the main
hm
that way it wont conflict controls with the pilot
yeah
i wonder if we could make a mechanical extendable arm
ok maybe this is going to be more difficult
possible
it has to be GLUED to the damn thing though
lol
docking clamps don't hold it steady?
gotta make sure you dont have dampeners enabled on the turret part while it is clamped
the gun moves the thing
?
basically it's a cockpit with guns on a swivel
firing the weapon causes it to go off-aim
it's doable though
oh
lol
the main concept is easy
gyros need to be on each moving piece though lol
how aimable is it?
very
with enough gyros
that's good
we should definitely make a 2 man fighter with a turret
lol
it'd also me fun to make a boarding ship
it would
there are a lot of cool things we can do lol
I want to go home
lol
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
um
?
are his eyebrows under his eyes?
nope
oh
ubuntu is weird
lol
it makes him look more happy and less creepy
the Tesla Model S has a programming API
I want one
dude
that sounds awesome
the turret thing?
the tesla
lol
oh
it just lets you do stuff like honk the horn, open doors, etc
aww
it can't actually make the car drive
i was thinking you could get data from the steering wheel and pedals and shifter and make a game inside the tesla's nav screen using the actual tesla controls
that would be cool
lol distracted driving? naaaah
it would only function if the car was in accessory on mode, engine not started, etc :P
although
it'd still roll
if you put it in neutral or whatever
lol
lol
but
what do you think about that turret idea?
not sure if it's viable, it has been tried many times and failed many times
first off, you'd have to be docked and stationary while the vehicle moves due to how the physics works in SE
unless that was changed recently
i dont see why that'd be a problem
basically, the mount would just rip off unless it is docked and stationary
well it's not
but you couldnt operate it while moving
it would if you had dampening on
it seems like it'd be fine otherwise
for a time, yeah, but little bits of damage add up over time, you'd have to use heavy armor connectors or even landing legs
sec
I docked my ship on to another ship that was thrusting, and I was able to pull it in another direction
without breaking my hold on it
that seems like it'd be more stressful than just the rotational torque of a turret
yeah. let me test it, i'm hopping on a creative world now
lol no joke that was my design
has a weird bouncing program
er
problem
except they have way more gyros
more gyros = more turn speed
ahah
I had 3 lo
does it stay attached fine?
we should make a large mothership that we can dock our stuff in as an entirely mobile base
^
I wanted to do that in creative
proof of concept thing
i was thinking, since survival will likely change a lot and more stuff will be added to the environment
we could dock our stuff and "jump" to a new area
that'd be cool
i.e. copy the ship in creative and then paste it in a new updated map
awesome
dafuq
on this echo360 thing
someone uploaded a naked woman as their profile picture
on the testing/development site
great
lol
wow
lol
that would be cool
i like the jump idea
I'm gonna see if I can make a mac cannon
will it shoot warheads?
lol I thought about that
heavy armor blocks was the thought
lol
i wonder how effective that would be
i mean, deco disabled a military ship by launching his body in to it apparently
so it'd probably work
gonna test
andrew can we join you?
i may head home an hour early since i dont have much to do anyways
lel
andrew has this weird way of disappearing
he doesn't watch skype while in games
lol
nor steamchat
oh nevermind
lol
steam chat i notice sometimes
i only have one monitor here
so i can't check skype
righto
i thought you were in reno?
not til like july 20th
oh
i got back to california yesterday
and have usable internet and my pc
but only one screen
mobile skype chooses the weirdest times to start notifying me of new messages
space engineers did not successfully shut down so it wont start up :F
and it is closed on everything but steam's side
it is telling me to close it
:F
lol
gonna restart
the process isn't listed in task manager process list?
nope
it was not
i double checked
it was odd
but fixed now
i is home
as soon as i hop off
lol
hop on mez's game, i want to show you my cannon
Brandon Worl
Anthony Humphreys
Brandon Worl

space?
I just got home from work
server's up. afk for a bit though
ap's on
still up?
yup
where chatting
mumbz?
or is that too dangerou?
yup
k
where did we get with the shipz?
still building
oh really
wow
lol
i am going to le beds
probably wont be on much tomorrow either
sadface.jpg
D: h'okay
made a world backup just incase
good night
night
noit
hi
vgh.. belgium just scored on usa
lol
Nearly everyone in my office is watching it
is there a livestream for that orr......?
hrm lemme check
there must be, dunno where though
people are watching it on their laptops/tablets here
could try one of these
found i think
vca
The us keeper is damn good
that's what I've heard
97:10 now right?
yeah they're in overtime
oh damn
2x15 mins if I recall
lol 14 saves? damn
xD
lel
EAgle and Wonder Woman
lol
2 bel - 1 usa
lol yeah... i found a good stream
'dat 16 year old tho
xD
oh 19?
ok
that's better
that makes more sense lol
This is turning out to be a very exciting game
it is
glad I tuned in when I did...cus damn
OOOH that was good
4 minutes left right?
should be another 13 .. could be wrong
oh snap
1 more minute
jeeeeeeeeze
the coach is livid
lawl
oh maaaaaaaaaaaan
end
With green out probably
but they got another minute
vgcg
THIS FREAKING GAME
xD
hooked yet?
lol yeah
and there it goes
lol
vgcg
xD
I was sure belgium was going home, europe is slowly being eliminated from the cup
America has never managed to beat Europe in the elimination round....
lol
Also Netherlands is going to finals against Germany, or at least it seems that way
It's good that the US is being recognized as a contender now
o.o
I heard Germany was the beast to defeat
Germany is always a strong contender
I'm surprised how badly England and Italy sucked this year
I'm not going to jinx the game yet xD
lol reddit is down
due to too many users
lol
We'll trade you Detroit for your national futbol team
haha
so when's the next match?
Give us your tulips and we'll even throw in Cleveland
27 attempts made on the us goal
lol wow
Next match is Friday
oh awww
next match ned vs costarica on saturday
nope
Brazil - Columbia
Then France - Germany
that one's gonna be intense
then NED vs CRC
ah thought you meant us
I'm gonna say the final's probably gonna be NED vs GER
(I assume Germany will win)
it's going to be a tough game
so guys, did you hear about that new emoji only social network?
Brandoni when can we Space?
wut
yeah
you can only use emojis
for username, messages, everything
wow
right now all you can do is reserve your username
I tried to get the turtle emoji as my username
but it was taken :(
kek
aww
so i am a hand pointing at a turtle
"( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"
that face doesnt display correctly on ubuntu skype
anyways
im still at work
ಠ_ಠ
when do you get off?
around 5ish
I'm totally stuck on this project and waiting for alex to reappear to answer questions
I have no clue where he went
the toilet
found him
he's in a meeting
aka
the toilet
yeah
alternative skyboxes for space engineers
What if I like the dead black of space?
but it's grey, not black!
by default
What if I like the mildly luminecest dark grey of space?
the dead black of space
hmm
Pretty space there
lunar orbit seems ot be the most popular
yeah
I may switch to a new sky box, but not one with a planet
just because I like the feeling of being in a large remote section of space
stranded there with our busted up red ship
*now only 8% damaged
lol
that's my emoji name
lol
lol
i am home
space time?
yus
in a couple minutes
lemme know when
in the mean time, watching a youtube vid
how aboot now
yes
boot ahow nao
nao on public server?
the server is booting up
just restarted
still playing?
yup
i want to build civilian transports
like
cool looking small sportscars
and mini-vans
and things
it's really too bad there's no advantage to being apart from other people
all the asteroids are super close
hard to build a civilization type thing when the map is so small
I've spent over two hours trying to figure out how to copy/paste in this VM
................
does that mean you figured it out?
no
i gave up
I also have to use vim
it's like trying to type with a 20 foot pole
heh
jesus nothing is ever easy is it
I have 15+ gigs free on this VM and I always get an out of space message when downloading this file at like 80% completion
._.
btw nao
what time would be best for Amnesiaing
umm
well, my parents will be sleeping
afk
sec
lol umm
well shit
back
so yeah
my parents will be sleeping
soo
hm
would it be better to do it at someone else's house?
with as many people as it seems we may have + the nature of amnesia, I dont think we could remain quiet enough to not wake them up all night
yeah
my laptop runs amnesia fine, and I have a 30 inch tv as well
so we could set it up anywhere really
ooh ok
Mai's might be ideal then since it's like her house
doing it outside with a projector and decent speakers would be fun
but i dont think we have a projector or speakers
it would be fun
but it would bother neighbors
also ruin the atmosphere I'm sure
find a place in Vegas that's dark
abandoned parking garage
full of vampires
because apparently I am Legend is a vampire movie
not a zombie movie
lol yeah
who knew
so my mom just randomly found a minecraft youtube video of a prank on the mindcrack server
she was all excited to share it with me
and i was like "oh, yeah, that's vintage beef. I know him"
after seeing the video for like 5 seconds
she was really confused why and how I knew that so quickly
lol
lol
i think thal/others are about to play The Ship
so, i'm going to dinner. I'll put the SE server up in like an hour
h'okay no rush
okie dokie
Next update
for warthunder
will have that
i have returned!
have you?
yup
as have I!
but i must shower
went to the beach like 2.5 hrs away
very sandy everywhere
lol
lol
much sand
very
so sand
wow
lol
twas fun though
got some bombsauce clam chowder
dude
oceanside clam chowder
ermagerd
it was very, very good
so was the calamari even though the region i was in was known only for its oysters
lol
and alex had a tuna melt that was apparently amazing
we have leftovers :P
lol
it uses a rotor system to move the grinders, so when it gets too much pressure put on them it stops moving
nice
this guy is a beast
Everyone loves trains right?
yes
everyone
waffles
happy birthday :p
thanks :D
facebook notified me, btw
lol
aye happy berths day
yeah my facebook came back some how
like
i deleted it
alex watched me do it
and it was gone
lol
but now it is back
hapi bersdej tu ju
woo andrew, I got an apartment lol
same property, ground floor, building A
for you nao
cool
so I saw that our docking things on the station could be set to have less breaking force
that way you can slowly approach and it will grab your ship and hold it steady
but then you can just fly away with enough force to break the hold
oh that's cool
yeah, and so much more convenient
did you see the space engineers dev blog about computer blocks?
very nice on the apartment!
almost close enough that you could hook into our wifi and lan party with me from afar lol
lol
i found out how you make a wall grinder without blowing it up
you have to move the wall, not the ship
and use a light torque on the wall's rotor so it doesnt press too hard on the thingies
and a low speed
but yeah
we should make a garbage compactor like star wars
two walls of grinders that slowly move inward
i want the new update to come out already :l
Andrew: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upFME8g_YYs
first thing I could find
that seriously has to be one of the creepiest things i've ever seen
you're in switzerland?!
yes
woo update is out
adds factions
nice
needs better environments and spreading of resources for factions to be effective though
lol factions?
ooh block ownership ok
factions, ownership of blocks, and some other stuff
looting dead engineer
yay
oh nice
so do we start a dr faction or no?
well we're not doing pvp
so no need
h'okay
LOL ANDREW
dude
bonus points to your mom for posting the Andoge pic
hmm?
haha
yeah
i told her about it
oh wonderful
is brandoge working from home today
?
I think so
we should space
i am WFH today
I'm basically done with stuff to do today though
so
spessss
I can host if we want
gimmie like 7 minutes
kkkk
k
k
kk
kkkkk
kkkk
kk
k
kk
kkkk
kkkkk
wfh?
work from home
oyah
oh cool you can choose a respawn medical room now
nice
no more yellow ships
lol
i don't know if that's a good thing
you can get yellow ships but there is a penalty
it resets your block ownership and stuff
oh lol
and kicks you from factions
ouch
it's a "permanent death"
whereas medical room respawn is just a respawn
makes sense
dangit no 6 way conveyor?!!?
argh!
lol
actually we should do the ship or something
not totally feeling the SE right now
we need more people for The Ship
risk of rain?
dont have
nao no has
i'd be down though
does nao have crime?
nao does have crime
eh
crime is fun
so is war thunder
eh
so eh
wow
lol
what do YOU want to play?
SE
i want to build ships
but survival is a pain to do that in
survival is fun though
yes but ships
I want to build something in creative
we could build a racetrack
we could do lots of things in creative :P
racetrack would be fun
could build a tank
lol
one of you fools needs to get dark souls so i have someone to play with lol
dark souls 1 or 2?
does the steam workshop have racetracks?
yes and yes
wat do
lol wow
that's one game i wish i got
transistor
it looks really cool
it's awesome
what's the premise behind it?
kinda hard to put into words
watch vintagebeef's first episode
it shows the gameplay well and doesnt spoil anything significant
not really my kind of game
lol
yeha
cool story and gameplay though
I just stole a mining hauler :D
it's an awesome game
if you like Bastion, you'll like Transistor
never tried bastion
but this mining hauler had a lot of missiles
like 70+
Basically a sentient sword that you can use functions (abilities) on. Will either give you an ability or upgrade existing functions.
nice
I just flew towards it in a yellow life boat and flipped backwards just before impact
the cockpit is basically all that survived of the lifeboat
blew a nice hole in the side that let me in
lel
so, I made a fighter
about to test it against a mili - nvm it despawned
so my fighter got taken out by a single bullet to the cockpit
so it turns out our world has a lot of stuff in it
43 large ships
that is a lot
lots of yellow ships and private sails
and business shipments
yeah
I deleted most of them
There was also a ton of free floating items
not surprising
tons of drills too
lol
the game really could use a better item and ship despawn system
the item limit is 128 on my server
and I have ship removal turned off
i dont trust it lol
I'd rather handle that myself
yeah that would suck if one of our prized ships just disappeared
I'm building a giant space station
and now I've decided i no longer like my space station
I may have underestimated the costs of this ship
that's like 1/3 of the frame
so yeah... to creative
mornong doktorz! herpy ferth erv jerley
hello doctor
herpa erpa
lol
FREEDOM
I'm setting up my laptop to host a dedicated SE server
nice
that will be cool
happy murica freedom day!
lol
my thoughts: creative mode
lol
they need creative mode with death on
it's the survival world
i know
i'm just sayin
dat creative :P
I'm building a ship on creative right now
well not RIGHT now
but I was last night
dedicated server is up. Name is "Naosyth's Server"
you have to be in my server's steam group to join
how do we steam group?
i invited you
i wish they had a linux dedicated server
so my AC adapter for my laptop doesn't work
and my backup AC adapter doesn't work
might be the laptop port that doesnt work
star citizen
it's a beautiful looking game
apparently the control scheme for dogfighting is derp as hell though
lol
?
shame :<
lol Grem has been telling me about all these ships he made
lol
we're playing right now
grinding down tons of military ships for steel
I won't be able to join mumble
but i fyou want I can hop on and grind things
we're a bit low on grinders
these ships have reinforced armor lol
the standard build ships with 1 grinder are too slow
I'm building a large ship with 9 grinders
lol
we're fine on builder ships, right?
well, we're planning on building a mother ship
so the more builders, the better
should i build a weld/grind ship, oooor...?
that's the design i came up with in creative
dunno if we'll go with it or a different one
that's the mothership? I like
yeah
where are hangars?
that middle ribbed section has 40 large containers
for a sense of scale
1 hangar in the bottom
neat
like, starwars style hangar where you float up in to it and the floor closes under
but
that's one thing... it has hardly any hangar space
lol
so might redesign
lol ok
actually
should I just make a flying transport/hangar?
making one sufficintly large would take a lot of materials
we've barely got enough for the mother ship to be feasible lol
but that is a good idea
we could have that ship as like a storage/refining/defense frigate
and a carrier
hrm
so would it be like a flying cube?
uhh
it has to look cool
lol
lol
creative I'm down to make a wicked mothership
where's the challenge in that? :p
lol
does this work
ok assuming this is correct chatroom woo
lol oh dear
besides fireworks
there's also thunder
Poor Winnie :< She's at home
oh hey it's cloudy outside
i should go outside more often
lol
I want it to storm
that'd be cool
I wish it would storm WHEN I WAS HOME though
did you at least get your laptop to charge?
lol yeah
i had to bend the wire to get it to connect
it's the cable
ah
used some electrical tape to kiiiinda hold it in place
this laptop is painfully slow though
righ click icon.
5 seconds later
menu
2 seconds later
item highlighted
I had to use my laptop to set up the dedicated server earlier
it was terrible
lololol
and like a month ago it was my main computer
odd disconnect no?
lol
I guess you just don't know slow until you know fast
uh oh
this is what i mean by kinda
cord stopped working
-_-
i may have no laptop
wait they might have a charger
well no i saw an apple laptop :<
-_-
i'm gonna be so bored
the cable shouldnt be that hard to fix
if it's just a loose connection
angling it any direction doesn't seem to help
oh fuck me
the actual plug came loose
lol
gg
this is stressful
it's like a timebomb attached to the computer lol
that was odd
i docked to this ship and the ship disappeared
not a trace of it left
o.o
the docked ship or the ship you docked on?
ship i docked on
luckily I was able to reset the server before an autosave
I wonder if we could build a giant pair of scissors that cut ships in half
lol maybe
wow
that is nuts
the point where I was really impressed was when the arms deformed upon impact
deformed?
what, went all snaky?
yes
ahah
yeah it's awesome how it does that
rotors
a LOT of rotors
dafuq
I just docked to that ship again and my docking port disappeared
...
of course it's pouring rain over there
blagh
it's like crazy
TONS of rain
cries
i see you have new silverware
blah
Yeah, it's great. I can bypass plates and bowls entirely with them
lol
use a bowl to eat out of a spoon
Netflix has a vid/audio desynch
slow internet
lol ah
their wifi is called "hollywood"
(there's also no h in sync :))
lol there is in synchronization
yes but google says "did you mean desync"
shhh
lol you  had to confirm?
I needed the collective data of the internet to back up my statement
lol
so apparently the third prequal to ender's game came out a month ago
what
oh wow
lol
she got djibouti
she got da booty
hah
got it
lol
thanks
uhh
shidu
found the high five emoji
:F
so risk of rain is really fun
progress
the imgur thing reminded me of this lol
alex and I played and she enjoyed it, though she died at the end and i finished it without her :F
:/
those military ships look intimidating
I've ground down most of the first one on the left
to get steel/interior plates
what's the gray thing at the top right of the screen
well
the rightmost ship
wat is?
military ship right?
yeah
military transport i think
gotcha
whatever one has the bomb in it when you reverse
minelayer
no
i thought that was the one with the reverse bomb?
minelayer also has a bomb but its bomb is crap
ah
gotcha
this one's bomb actually kills you
lol
i feel like being a pirate and stealing a ship like that would be cool cause you'd have to coordinate with teammates or something
my ship will be around 3x the size of those big military ships when it is finished :D
nice
ETA on finishing it?
a long time
lol
Those black bars... I have been welding for hours
this is gonna be one of those things where you put it up on reddit and youtube and say "so yeah i did this in survival" and you get another 100 subs
nah nobody really browses /r/spaceengineers
really impressive things on there consistently get like 60 upvotes
lame
maybe there's just tons of lurkers
they did just reach 10k subs today though
i'm a total lurker
that's not bad
I posted how to fix the unable to save map glitch yesterday
it got like 8 upvotes
lol
lol
"hmm yes very interesting but boring and i don't have this problem... bye"
actually just about every server had the problem
so this week i've gone from "yeah i should be abl to get space engineers with this next paycheck" to "holy crap where did my money go?"
"hmm yes very interesting I wanted a fix for that... bye"
:Z
i know how you feel
my radiator cracked on my way home from work today T__T
$140
ouchhhh
yeah
wheeeee
my nissan had that happen a while ago
just crack an egg in it
i saw it on mythbusters
lol
ewww
no more eggs
for my 21st i did a sake bomb with quail egg and oyster
*gags*
the quail egg got stuck on the back of my tongue
that sounds disgusting
*vomits*
gagged to the point of almost vomiting
ALMOST
then i spit out the egg
i would have though
and ate the oyster
no questions
the oyster was good
as was the sake and hot sauce
oyster is gross >.<
that's disgusting
the egg was sooooo bad
lol
you guys just LOVE imagining it, don't deny
ugh my stomach is churning just at the thought of taking that shot
I love imagining you gagging on the egg
lol
i was sad nobody was takinga  video of it
haha
i ended up chugging two japanese beers after that just to try and forget the egg in my throat
there is SO much welding to be done on this ship
im sad that i wasn't recording my epic scared-the-pants-off-of-me freakout playing borderlands yesterday :(
I only have like 1/6 of the frame lad out so far too
lol
you should just frame it all while someone welds for you
really we need a full team of people to build a mother ship
if i had the funds i would get it and weld for you but meh
deco is out of town and gremlin is away
ouch
soon
the minimum wage in CA just went up this past tuesday :)
that's the general design idea
gonna change up the front though
i'd gift it to you if it was still on sale, got a bunch of steam cash for my b-day
it was on sale yesterday in the humble store
33% off
dunno if it still is
awh
saw that, like the star wars hangar idea
but we do need more hangar space
see, I was thinking
and
we need to make a legit Independence Day ship
really anything larger than those yellow life boats doesnt make sense to dock in a ship
complete with derp lazor
I also don't trust docking legs to hold ships in other ships to begin with
true
@m31 that would be cool
derp lasers are tough since there are no lasers
I'd rather have a bunch of fighters/drop ships than like... big ships docked
really really fast firing gun?
there are gatling guns, missile launchers, and turrets of those
that's it
also warhead mine/bombs
hmm
not much in the way of weaponry yet
ok, we build a death star
no lazer
but full surface array of weaponry
dont forget to leave a hole heading straight to the power core
^
lol
I'm gonna get this middle section done so we have access to all that storage
that'll make building the rest of the ship easier
you should make reactive regen armor and just have the ship weld itself
this ship is far too large for that
lol
you know what that sounds like to me?
quitter talk
are you a quitter?
NO
rational talk*
am I rational?
sometimes
You know what quitters do?
is that possible though?
they QUIT
yes
it is
but i'm not quitting
im building
you're quitting your train of innovation
that isnt innovative though
the train has been derailed and ran into the mini-mall off the side of the tracks
people have done it
you know what is innovative?
giant ship cutting scissors
lolol
saw those
that's where the future lies
been done
damn
uhhh
lol
build optimus prime
the future lies in....
that dude you linked earlier with the grappler
he made one
oh
well then
lol
he beat me to it
but uhhh
it lies in....
death star
giant space nets
that..
yes
you probably saw the link in your periferal and got the idea incepted that way
nah
i realized ships have a TON of torque
I was turning my ship
it sliced right through the armor of another
like a sword
using gyros only
no engine
sounds about right
yeah
lol
nets like this with the weighted balls on corners though https://www.animal-care.com/inc/cart/Assets/product_full/throw-net.jpg
net launcher ship
people have made giant ships shaped like swords and used them accordingly, and they worked with minimal repair needs
lol
m31, could be done
see? that's innovative
mass blocks on the outside, forward facing landing legs, and an ejection system
space pirate
be one
the connectors on the interior would be interlinking landing leg/rotor combos
someone made a working harpoon right after they added landing leg locking
lol
breaks through hull, pops open, locks landing legs while pulling
worked about 80% of the time
but with nets like that be like "hey, i'm taking your ship hostage!" then net them until they pay you
only failed if it didnt pen enough or if the interior wasnt open enough on the inside
lol
k, bed
night
'night
night
probably be on tomorrow btw
I expect an innovative idea from you tomorrow
does the idea have to involve a ship or just a piece of weaponry?
anything
is it possible to drop a gyro that begins to spin up and once it reaches x radial velocity to release a bunch of shrapnel on the plane it's spinning in?
not yet
aww
they're going to eventually add programmable computers
with C# style syntax
but something like that would be possible with the ship itself im assuming?
not as effective though
beyblade ship (lol)
lol
i want them to add remote control drone cockpit things
remote drones?
so that I can make a remote control cruise missile
or autopiloted attack ships
*wink wink*
lol
a carrier with a bunch of drone ships would be pretty cool
apparently having camers on drones is illegal
but
fireworks
hah
lol would have been so funny if that drone got taken out by a blast
innovative idea of the day: with multiple people those spinning shrapnel thingies m31 is talking about are possible
actually they're probably possible just using rotors
if you have connectors with a low shearing force hooked up to a spinning rotor setup on each side of a launched capsule, the rotors would hit a high enough speed to send out the shrapnel
be jelly
i am
is that a huge mp server or something?
no idea
i imagine creative
a guy made that in 2 hours
just to make the background
jesus
he said you get like 1 fps there
XD
that whole back paty is copy/pasted
it's just a thin slice repeated
it would be fun to build the Spirit of Fire
it would be
it's probably already up
no hits on Steam Workship for it
nvm
it helps if you spell it correctly
someone did it using a 3d model importer
oh wow
UHHH
WHOOPS
I uhh
just...
ground up deco's build ship
I thought it was one of those mining ships we stole for parts....
O.O
XD
it was bound to happen
oooooooh that's amazing
that's what you get from painting it YELLOW
like the REST OF THE SHIPS
"why does this mining ship have welders?"
"there was a lot of stuff in that cargo hold o.O"
welp
go brandon
"óh shit"
how the hell did I get a ' over that o on accident?
apparently ctrl + ' followed by a letter puts a ' over it
áéó
lol
lól
ll
only 4 u
did you do ctrl ' and then release all keys and THEN push a button?
lól
oh
ñ
works for ctrl shift ~ as well
ã
that's useful
jalapeño
appears to be a skype thing rather than a windows thing
yeah i tried it on notepad
lol
same
lol
moar progress: http://steamcommunity.com/id/Naosyth/screenshots
er
with a person for scale
nice
. . .
wonder when he'll find out
probably when he gets on and tries to build something
welp
lemme know how that goes
maybe if we dont say anything he wont notice
he'll notice
his ships are his babies
he can't stop talking about 'em
he'll notice
ASAP
this just gets worse and worse
i tried to dock it because it was drifting away
physics bugged out
it is now flying away SUPER fast
well shit
i caught it
nut im too far out to see beacons
but*
what have you done
and with what
shit
my ship exited mission area
restarted... but I just realized that wont help me
the ship still has velocity
only deco's is lost completely
found and reset the other
:F
hopefully
lol
we'll see
yes hopefully
saved both :D
lol you saved both?
Nao for the win
i saved the wreckage of his and my ship
dont get me wrong, his is still toast
tim howard didn't save that one :(
I have an old backup with his ship still though
so I could paste it in
lol
awww
wat
waaaaaaaaaaaaaat
oh hiiiii
hiii deco
I come back from vacation to waaaaaaaaaat
we got lots of missiles decooooo
missiles!
be happy!
....
What did you people do to my ship?
so
your construction ship
it may be a little scratched
but
the good news is
oh
i can reload it from a backup
Is the destructor okay?
yeah
that's the one I was worried about
lol
The construction ship is not a number 1 worry
lol
we should play war thunder
lol not the reaction I was expecting, but I should have
Should have what?
expected
Expected me not to care?
lol
expected you to to suggest War Thunder
Although I did forget what that philosophy field was called
not skepticism
pacifism?
Something where you remove yourself from the problem.
Communism.
Yes, Communism.
"Was it the red ship?" "No." "K."
no
Nihilism
is what you are looking for
yeah that
That's still not evidence that you're NOT a Communist.
How about me selling worthless junk for thousands
That's pretty good evidence I'm a Capitalist
lol
sounds communist to me, a capitalist would market the useless junk first so he had a long term investment rather than a short term gain for the good of the commune
but an American capitalist would sell without marketing because he believes it's a good idea.
I sold it for myself to make money
yup
progress pics needed: on my phone and want to SE but cant because super tired and getting up early :F
not much progress since you last saw it
been eating/doing summer school stuff
now I'm mining iron
to make metal grid
turns out a LOT of the ramps have neither metal grid nor steel rods
they get to 50% and then look completge but are not
so I'm just gonna make a few assemblers and get a ton of iron
Gotcha. That sucks lol good to know though. We should set up a few cargo containers specifically to hold each item and mass produce them all. Would make it easier to fill the welding ships with everything we need
We could do one assembler per item
FTL
fun as hell
First time?
yeah
ermagerd
addicting
STOICISM
that was it
the next large survival ship will definitely have FAR fewer ramps
progress update: http://cloud-4.steampowered.com/ugc/791540008/809D304E98DBD0D6652A50C5DC509AE5F19592C7/
nice, more framing :P
I can definitely say i'm not looking forward to furnishing the inside
"so lets see... we need 60000 lightbulbs..."
DAMN SON
ignore those caps
I choose to not ignore those caps
i chose to
wow
gremlin did a lot of mining last night
lol did he?
we have just under 700k iron ingots
XD
wow
that's really impressive and useful lol
lol
hahah Grem says he had to repair the destructor a few times
lol
oh apparently
he hijacked a freighter
While he was grinding it down it spun into the Destructor and took out the rear refinery and floated off into space
so he repaired it and called it a night
poor Deco ships
"like gluing back together the broken vase before mom got home"
hahaha
<.<
FTL is depressing D:
won yet?
no
Farthest I got was to the flagship zone
never faced flagship
did one jump and got obliterated
hahaha yeah that happens 80% of the time
That game is bananas
Usually I try to explore the sectors as much as I can
beautifully made
but bananas
good idea
fuel isn't my friend though :<
yeah
Unlocked any ships?
Engi vessle is nice though it's mostly defensive. You'll ragequit a bit before you get anywhere
lol I think so
That's the drone one right?
I THINK that's the one
yeah with the ion weapons
yeah
there's a few strategies you can do....shame you can't build your own out of the gate
yeah, though there are a few mods
I just need to get those achievements D:
yeah :P
It's so depressing!!!
hahaha
FTL is the best on a tablet
100% cool
lol i believe that
totally feel like a ship's engineer when messing with power
i feel like there should be a co-op mod for FTL that adds a bit to the universe like maybe pvp in groups where each person has a job on their tablet, like one person does weapons, one does power, one does crew movement, and the captain decided locations to go to and tells the crew what to do
found an interesting bug i guess
if you die with your chat window open and hit enter after the respawn screen comes up, your chat won't come up anymore
so quiet today
shhh
no speaking in the library
i speaka yo langageg
no one's on SE today?
FTL it is!
wait
on SE
just not mumbz
lol
guys i can finally dark souls for good amounts of area without totally getting owned by the weakest of things!
lol
lol woo!
i've beaten a few of the tougher enemies on my first try as well
which is cool
just got to the second big boss and almost beat it but ran out of fireballs (i'm a pyromancer)
he then proceeded to breathe fire onto my body. that does not do good things for your hp
anywho, time for bed. i get to be a substitute janitor tomorrow from 6:30 to 2:30 :F
(am to pm)
g'night
nite
good luck
i got 44/50 lol
i got 40/50 when I did that
ok after this I'm not working for this guy
"2 landing pages 2 banners and 2 tiny banners per campaign" "ok cool"
"actually all that per app. This campaign has 2 apps" "...ok"
"Here are 2 hi rez logos" "you sent nothing"
"here are 2 hi rez logos" "...he googled those"
this company would have potential if he weren't such a twit
"your making up the copy"
cries. WHY
o_O
seriously
lolol
"has thin eyes. possibly asian"
lol saw that

oooookay then
yeah, cuz the internet is down
clearly
so I discovered why my third monitor is more blue
>_>
que?
despite being the exact same model, it is different than the other two
different refresh rates, screen technology, etc
lol oh wow
so, the colors are different on it compared to the other two
and it is just naturally more warm from being used heavily for 2 years
lol Hh
ahah*
"stupid people are some of my favorite people as long as I don't have to interact with them much" - my boss

wat s?
nexus 5
as in a galaxy nexus 5?
no
a nexus 5
O.o
my tablet is a nexus 7
nexus is google's official hardware
not associated with samsung galaxy
ah
byw nexus no longer looks like a word
morning, doctors
morning sir
got the frame of the behemoth grinder done last night
just need about a bajillion construction catalysts now >.<
oh my god x_x
my research professor just emailed me
an article about why it is impossible to get good distance measurement using wifi/radio strength
I sent him like 12 articles saying just that and he ignored them!
>_<
lolol
you mean construction components?
those
yes
we have quite a few
not anymore?
i think
did you check the big ship's storage? It should have a few thousand I think
oh no
lol brandon
You know I sent him those articles! and explained to him why it is impossible to get good results!
so i now have a hand splint and it is freaking impossible to move my thumb XD (though that's kinda the point)
why? did you break your hand?
dislocated thumb
ouch
only partially
jeeeeeeze dude
but enough that it kept pinching a nerve in my hand and sending pain all the way up my arm
which thumb is it?
so after 3 months of that, i can take the inability to move thumb or hold a mouse
right
and of course i am a righty :(
lol yeah
well i can hold a mouse, i juse have to hold my arm at a funny angle :P
So, I had an idea
?
It would be cool to make a giant asteroid somehow, with a sphere of gravity generatos in its core
so that we can walk/drive on the surface
yes
much yes
lol
Making the sphere of gravity generators would be difficult but not impossible
then, I can use SEToolBox tomove it inside the asteroid
oh and im working on a prototype uberdrill
but I'm not sure how to actually generate a large asteroid
ooh cool, SEToolbox can import a 3d model as an asteroid
idjits
all of them
idjits
"lol I don't get it" "spell it out loud" "OH lol"
people can't read
lmao
so, I just got off a call for that independent project
I'll be working with another intern, he'll handle most of the android side and I'll get the web side
that actually sounds fun
It's a lot of work - we need a working demo by mid august lol
all it has to do is track battery usage and plot it over time though
for the demo
wasn't that part of your personal project?
this is that
why is it so hard to remember my partner's name x_x
I was talking with Alex and I was like "my partner, whose name I forgot because I am bad at names..."
lol
hmmm I need to come up with a name for this app
what's it do exactly?
collect and format/display phone metrics
what would a movie call it?
something edgy where they drop a vowel or something
or where they add an 'i' in front
but lets not add an i
call it "The Stats"
want info? Just look at The Stats"
lol
possible
easy for someone to find it if they look for it
might not work well for google queries
everything this collects is plotted against time
so
if it was a movie
it'd be chrono something
because time is ALWAYS chrono
lol yeah
or maybe temporal
Watch Watch?
watch things over time?
hmm no, sounds like it'd be used for those new android watch things
I dont need a name right away at least
for now the sketch just says "NAME HERE"
"histogram"
i like that
it could also be something like "histograf"
or histograph
lol
Histographone
kidding
haha
Histograph sounds nice and corporate
you could call it MEtrics
i like histograph
nothing with that name pops up from a quick play store search
ooh
nao I may need to borrow a top hat of yours
Mentrics?
btw Brasil 0 - 6 Germany
so far, humiliation
lol the game was on while we were at lunch
we stopped watching it while we discussed app stuff for like 20 minutes then looked back up and it was 0-5
lol wow
7-0
this has to be a joke
bahahahah
german
Ubermensch
I think they're just messing around now
Like they're taking it nice and slow, no real rush
Annnd brazil is cheering the Germans
tumblr would say they are 200% done
ze germans are doing it again!... murica halp!
lol
Oh God it's hosted in Brazil too, isn't it?
yeah
Good luck to the germans leaving the country... xD
Heh,  if you think Brazil was rioting before...
haha
That's one of those "Brazil should just go home" things
or maybe the team is heavily affected by the riots and morale is low
yeah
all that compounded pressure...man
1-7
lol
"The Germans are furious"
I think "Mildly Upset" is more apt
although a lightly disgrunted German looks furious
oh XD
commenter
lol
"Oscar....scores the most pointless of World Cup Goals."
that's fucking harsh
reddit, of course, has crashed
nope wait
that poor phone
lol
*Sees a guy get owned and rekt by 4 people
*that poor phone
well maybe he owed them money or killed their sister, you never know
I hadn't noticed the phone before :P
but that phone was surely innocent
it was probably a nokia
lol
^just my thoughts
dropped it without a though
lol I would have aimed for a chair or something
how the heck does this fill up without stretching...
working on wobsite again
My mind is going everywhere, plz clarify
lol
oh it must be java or something
finally found the base element
javascript
everytime i resize it it auto-sets the the margin
yeah that
javascript
found it
yay
oh this is gonna get weird
so fast
is having empty divs a crime?
like <div></div> ?
yeah...
you should remove it if you can
:/
why do you need an empty div?
to get it what I want it to do, I need a container, which will set the background image
the way slick.css works (plugin) is it uses divs to change out images
so i'll have to set empty divs with "background images" in order for them to fil lup the page cleanly AND transition
so it isn't really an empty div then, is it?
if it is displaying an image
stylistically no, structurally yes
there's nothing really wrong with that, if it serves a purpose
ok cool
I wanted to make sure I wasn't committing crimes against webbery
lol
wobbery
dotcommery
so, after much discussion with people here, I have determined that I can drastically simplify this app idea
but my partner is MIA
but basically instead of storing collected data on the web, just keep it all on the phone
and graph it all on the phone
and ditch the web app idea
but make it a hybrid app (made with html/css/js)
so that in the future it can easily be scaled up to a web app with a web database/api
that way we can get a prototype together much faster, but still expand it easily
dude
and it almost becomes stupidly simple to build
yuss
hopefully the beauracracy won't get in the way
well, I only have to convince my partner
and that'll be easy
because this is easier to do
lol
"want to do less work but look like a boss?"
but still expandable to the original idea
I was also trying to think of other future features we could add
and I came up with data plotted against position
like, a heatmap of your locations around town
or a map of cellphone coverage based on what you've observed with your phone around town
that'd be a version 2.0 thing though
still awesome
how'd you get paired up with someone on your own project?
lol
everyone is working in groups
ahah
i guess just because of the short time frame
lol did you get to choose yours?
not really
so like school but with competent people
that must be so nice
the guy in charge of this told me to talk to him (my partner)
((Whose name I forgot AGAIN))
(I was gonn ask)
PHILIP DAVIS
there
I remembered
without looking
anyways
he was planning on working with Android
that's why Daniel told me to talk to him
about teaming up
nice
Philip Davis
sounds like Lou Diamond Philips
PD
Partner Dude
lol
XD yes
guys
today is jaden smith's birthday
so i've seen
his 16th
but how can days be real?
if the sun isn't real?
also, dat hurr
if the son isnt real
lol
it is quite stormy outside
is it stormy in our end of the valley, tony?
no
it's overcast
no wind
no rain
awww
still hot
it's SUPER windy here
it's just insulation over here :<
super windy, no rain yet
very dark and gloomy outside
it's wonderful
lol
it does look quite nice today
i wish it'd rain
now that i'm HOME
it rained a little bit on my way to work today
heh
...hm
slider doesn't work when the divs are background images
bummer
saaaaaadness
summatime sadnessss
lol
got dat summa time sadnesssss
lol dat cloudburst
The sudden violent winds just shook the old building I work in so bad
lol
lol
i went to the bathroom and when I came back one of the doors to the outside was open
it was like walking to to a wind tunnel
Cloudburst are cool
and only can occur in some parts of the Earth
california is one of those places
wikipedia leads me to believe this is not a cloudburst
Why is that?
because they involve rain, first of all
and there doesnt appear to be much rain
It is pouring on my side of town
arent you near me?
I am all the way south
Like 20 blocks south of the Airport
well, wikipedia also has a list of recorded cloudbursts which only lists one for the US
though it probably isnt an exhaustive list
"Record cloudbursts"
Record
as in
most rain
oh
indeed
We get cloudbursts here every year
just not record ones
3.97 inches per hour is a lot of rain though
lol
Well, we get about 1.5 in 10 minutes
From wikipedia:
"They can also occur when hot water vapor mingles into the cold resulting in sudden condensation."
That is what happens to us
Hot ground + Humidity + Cold clouds = Rapid condensation
wikipedia makes them sound so disasterous though
and our storms are nothing compared to most of the world
We get up to 2 inches in 10 minutes
We just have flood control
Have you ever been outside of Vegas during a storm like this?
lol
The ground turns into a lake out by Boulder City
lol
Down by that solar power plant
I remember that one storm a few years ago
the road my culdesac extends off of was a river
and my backyard became a pool
That's typical cloudburst results
lol
Were you here in 1998?
yes
We had one that year that washed out some of the street-over-wash bridges
In 15 minutes
dude that one
my elementary school flooded bad
^
Mine too
there were STAIRS covered
They evacuated us
tbh I don't even remember that one, though I was here during it
that was such a cool storm
lol no evacuation
i remember seeing recycling bins floating down the street
My class room had 2 inches of water xD
jeeeze
lol
The school was at the bottom of a hill though
One time my school held us late because it was raining
That's why
not even flooding or anything
just raining
dumb
dumb
dumb
You need at least water inside the building
lol
whenever it rains, water leaks on to my bathroom floor from the air vent
and if it gets super bad, it leaks from the stove's vent too
wut
How old is your house?
built early 's
idk exactly
lol
this new phone's screen is SO much better than my old one
You guys see Brazil lost 7-1 against Germany?
yes
lol
yaaaaah
lol
Go home Brazil
Wait
they are home!
buh bum tis
seriously though imagine that pressure
I guess germans are just the superior race
Ubermensch
Ja
Goalecaus has already been making it's rounds on facebook
I am glad I'm not flying in this wind. lol
yyyeeeeehhh...
thank god we're driving to chicago
windy city
Chicago?
san francisco?
DERP
yes that
san fran
sorry
lol
I think San fran is San Diego and San Fran is also Chicago
never San Fran
lol
i get diego/fran mixed up
also... there's the thunder
jeeze
BOOOOOOOOOOooOOOOoOOoooOOOOOOOOOOOOOM
really though
that like echoed off of the walls in here
I guess I should probably head home before the 5pm rush and before the rain starts here
bbl
I left too due to that
Which is why I am on
no thunder
why is everyone getting married
well nevermind I know why
but g'damn
I attempted to generate 50 large asteroids on a blank map
it is taking a while
lol
now it generated but loading the map in the game is taking forever
and that's with an SSD
damn meister
that's a lot of grinders
lol
overkill
is
underrated
uhh
margin-left: auto;
does nothing
margin-left: 50%; does
wat
auto is probably doing exactly what it should be doing
probably
-_-
having an image with a background image makes for weird alignment
lol
god
I don't mean to but I make weird faces when I refresh and nothing happens
nao why am i unable to join you in SE?
well I'm on a SP creative world right now
ah
but is the server having issues?
how do i join it?
:F
server list
"Naosyth's Server"
gotcha
gonna work on the eater of ships some more
I'm redesigning major portions of my large ship lol
mumble?
watching etho :F
ah k
those symmetry planes in creative mode totally kill my game
i wish you could sort servers by name >=0
apparently there's a steam game browser or something
and you can join by ip and stuff
but uh
you can
sort by name
so i see
then their font is just hell to read
yeah not seeing it
uhhh
i can restart the server
sec
weird
it shut itself down and stopped responding
ah
that would do it
should be back up in a minute
sweet jesus the npc ships
so many
like 20 of them
i know right? what the hell
there's never more than 2 at once
so uh
small steel tubes
are important
how do we aquire more?
assembler
production tab at the main station
so im just gonna make an assload of those
gonna take a break from SE for a bit. gotta decide if I want to actually redo the middle of that ship or not >_<
lol
i only need 4000 small steel tubes :x
lol
just make them all at the assembler
we have a lot of iron
i set it to go, and it's working
but i guarantee we dont have enough XD
enough iron?
to make 4k?
at least not enough ingots
we have like 500k ingots
I've told it to make 10k metal frames and 10k interior plates before when we only had like 100k iron ingots
we'll have enough
oh i see, the extras were in refineries
we good we good
if the internet ever finds your shame
it will put it on display for it's entertainment
like those ladies stealing on the beach
lol YUP
so sad
such lose
cannot into futball
can you make a custom 404 page using just 404.html ?
i believe you can direct the 404 page to any html file you want
...how
.htaccess I think
...huh
...if i wanted to, though, would 404.html work?
or do I have to go through htaccess and change things?
if that's what htaccess is set to redirect to
idk if that's the default or what
oh that's simple
ok
well that was frightening
browsing through pics on FB
"People you may know"
it's...
Hitler?
i jumped
...
oh i know him
What kind of friends do you have?
lol
lol weird ones but that surprised me
wait a minute I actually do know this guy
that's not his picture
wtf
...
. . .
yeah i know him but the pic I dunno
you here tony?
yes
can you set owner to none on the stuff you added on the raccoon?
thought i did, one sec
let me know if it didn't work
anyone want to try and take down a Blockade Runner in Spess Engineers with fighter ships?
So I found a way to remember that it's JavaScript and not JAva
kind of like how I remember your Partner Dude is Philip Davis
lol
how?
I've never once touched a .j file
they're always .js
(java doesnt use .j)
(I've CLEARLY never touched a java file)
lol
java is .class or.. something else, I forget
...dumb
depending on if it is compiled or not
it isnt dumb
lol
.class
is right
I think
lol
they are compiled class files
^
That
javascript doesn't get compiled to begin with
hence "script" in its name
why are they called java?!
because programmers like coffee i guess
fair enough
i mean
there's also coffeescript
they are fuckign with me now
all of them
which is a layer added on top of javascript
they're laughing at me
to make the syntax better looking
I'm going to make a language
called darkroast
lol
I could totally see that being a thing
^
somewhat related:
See
a few weeks ago at our all-hands meeting
Alex was talking about some work he got done at his house
replacing baseboards, using his nailgun, etc
but
the guy next to me thought those were all computer things
XD
hahahaha
wooooow
baseboard language, nailgun package, etc
lol
lololololol
in the middle of it he goes "OH! YOU AREN'T TALKING ABOUT TECHNOLOGY"
ahhh that's great
lol
...but jquery isnt js...
it is
then what in the hell
it's a library that makes manipulating the DOM easier through js
ok so if i popped jquery code between script tags, it should work?
yeah
assuming you are including jquery
with a script url= tag
pointing to jquery, of course
......dang parallax
i wonder if I can get away with just scrolling
doesn't make for a good ux though...
implementing parallax is pretty easy
o.O
got links or suggestions?
Well, doing it in pure js is pretty easy
hah ahah...
I uhh...hm
with a mix of js and css animation, you could get a nice smooth effect
T_T
js alone might be a bit choppy
anyways
you just get the scroll position
and then multiply it by some factor for each background layer
as the y position
ah
farther back = larger factor to divide by
there's almost certaintly some scroll event you can hook in to
i've seen multiple examples
codepens, tutsplus, etc.
:/ none of them allow me to keep everything I want though
like what?
at least not that I know of
my masonry grid
heck it'd be beast if I could find a way to do this with slick still functioning but I had to chop that off
well, each section is in a div with a background image set
so you just do like I said for those divs
and everything inside them will parallax correctly
hm...
although there are multiple types of parallax effect
so perhaps you should clarify what look you are going for
well i THINK i found something
I don't know how ot explain it beyond parallax
i want close thigns to scroll slow and far things to scroll a smidge faster
since that seems to be trending
that's the look you want?
except vertical scrolling
this just seems oto be the easiest plug and play
well, this isnt really scrolling anything faster than anything else, is it?
this is shifting backgrounds up or down as you scroll
it's subtle
unless I'm looking at it wrong
but the text comes up to meet the whitespace between seasons
the text isnt moving relative to the parent div though
that does it, right?
that one is more complex than the seasons one
lol
seasons was uber simplified
same thing, just one's the home vs. demo page
so seasons was probably using 8 pairs of 2 layer parallax
whereas that home screen is probably using a ton of layers
lol
should work though, right?
probably
you know what would be cool? An app that lets you prototype app designs
like click/drag different UI elements around the screen
pen and paper work
like no joke if there's loads of scrap paper it's a great way to lay things out roughhand
although ifyou wanted...
guh i can't find it :/
wtf it puts it off-center
that's a terrible kind of infuriating
Y U DO DIS
lol
i'm using pencil/paper
derp found it
^is best way
I'll have to translate it to photoshop once I have a good idea of what I want, but yeah
it's a good way to get to there
sketching's always been the best way after I learned to get off the computer
I just don't have a ruler with me so this isnt the same size/ratio as a mobile screen
but it's close enough
heh
i just got the death's harp bow unique in POE with a perfect roll \o/
._.
here we go
Go nederlander.
well wait
Holland
derp
sorry D:
sorry sorry
sorry
nederlander works too (is dutch)
lo siento
theeeeen it's not inappropriate?
*is nervous... why? who knows
yeah it is appropriate
lol ok
One of my good friends at faire is from Holland
we call him "The Dutchie"
and steal his shoes
D:
One of the most positive gents I've ever met.
Lol it's all in good fun. He's a good entertainer.
lol duchie
yeeaaaaah sorry >_<
yeah
wait Duchie was correct?
no
tbh I have no clue what qualifies as the netherlands and what doesnt
there was a diagram once
i saw it
that I followed into madness
dont remember it
lol
clarification: nederlander = dutch for dutch person
it was too complex
oh ok
Holla for Holland
lmao you are full of puns today
erryday
yeah, every day
always
lol
...I like how to the right of this stream is a link to "Hot World Cup Girls"
lol
<<< also german for dutch person
oh hey
well then
Go Nederlander!
how do you cheer in Dutch...
so is sweden part of the netherlands?
don't they say hollander
no wait ugh
*slap
lol
because it makes a hell of a lot more sense to say nederlander than dutch for someone from a country called netherlands
niederlander* I think yeah
silly english pigs
XD
Dutchland
hahah
Deutschland
<-- not a real name
is germany
and Nederlander
is for Dutch
who live in Holland
words, man
words
xD
better stream imo :)
yeah my parents are watching espn on the island
lol yes
I just couldn't find it
i thought ESPN had to oh this one's a few seconds behind
dutch players is also commentating I think
player*
i swear if van persie is offsides so much again this game im going to rage
lol these commenters are...ok
xD
robben is the actor
^
so good
The game feels more relaxed than y'da
day*
than germany's roflstomp of brazil? lmao
i think they're both measuring each other
oh bs
waiting to activate beastmode
lol yeah
yeah that was just horrible
xD
... they always like to get a foul right infront of the goal
. . .
this is why they're lax
is there a limit on free kicks?
lol nice
lol *shoomp* "Deal with it."
I don't think there is xD
dang
well I like how Holland just got right back up
no fucks given
I think Holland's going to take this one just because they're not really stressing.
yeah but they get very defensive when the other team makes a goal
the commentator almost gave me a heartattack
lol
lol like that physics machine
ok that was weak
and in typical fashion, vp is offsides
wheeeeee
also, is it me, or does the dutch coach look like donald trump? lol
lol
Without the superiority complex
xD
lol
lol was he even clutching the correct wrist?
ugh, I swear if this is a foul-off...
there's a south american team in this match, it's going to be a foul-off
they all fake it at some point
they tend to flop a lot more than other regions though
I don't remember doing any of these fakeries during school soccer
lol
during school soccer i just ran towards whatever end of the field had more people and avoided the ball
hey, if i roll on the ground longer than the other guy, he gets fouled, right?
lol yup
soccer I ran towards the ball ish... I was more defense
yup
WOO I BEAT FTL
on easy
DON'T CARE
gratz
lol
lol his hand went up
HEY REF LOOK
so tony, the thing I'll be working on soon uses both java and javascript at the same time
there's a difference?!?!?
it's funny, because you keep switching the two up
lol
there
using both at once would probably be 10x more confusing :p
so how many times are players gonna go down this match?
lol yeah
hmm
place your bets
I think the winner of this match iiiiis gravity
lool
dingdingdingding
it's raining
people are gonna fall more
lol
mixed with the tears of a heartbroken nation
daaaaaamn
oh my god lol
shots were fired
dafuq was that? D:
yeaaaah he's become a target
dammit dutch you're better than this
does anyone watch their arms?
it's fucking hilarious
penalties is such a bs way to end the game
:/
yeah
yup
it's like a whole other game
lol the fans are more fun to watch
at least if netherlands brings out that monster goalie again, we have a chance
that guy is huge
seriously
lol
lol offside persie
FINALLY
WAIT
NOOOOOO
W T F
offside
xD
lol jeeze
xD
gawd
welp
saw that coming
+30mins extension
robben so gud tho
He's fit this time around
oh crap
I don't wanna watch
so i forgot to turn my oxygen back on and 80% of my crew died
lolol
i hate that so much
xD
shit
...
well
crap
welp
Go Germany
^
that keeper has never blocked any penalties ever
EVER
xD
i know van persie didnt do shit but they should have subbed in their other goalie
yup :/
meh.. the world hasn't ended
next brazil
apparently tomorrow's SE update brings "real cars"
hm
TIL my laptop can't boot if I have headphones plugged in to it
lol
this is cool: http://nexus5accessories.com/pressy-android-smart-button/
huh
neat
and
my radiatior is shot
on my car
I made it home
o.o
oh wow
but I had to keep the RPM's under 1500
water temp was maxed out
Guess I am seeing a mechanic tomorrow
"my radiatior is shot" welcome to the club :D
You too?
yup
well, not anymore... but my head gasket is still blown so i run the risk of overheating
wheeee

ok now z-indexes are messing with me on this parallax thing
I hope Germany kicks Argentina like small puppies like they did Brazil
I don't want to see Argentina win
yeah
that was a lot of foulage
I like to see the ground baby countries get their butts kicked by countries that play legitimately
(Ground babies: Mexico, Argentina, Spain, Italy)
Sneeze near them and they go flying
apparently this is the mansion the originate attack is at: http://vegasestate.com/
(warning: autoplay music)
it sleeps 28 people. we'll have 150
wat
i fucking hate that song
of all the songs
haha you know it?
Isn't that house in Spanish Trails?
it's near the airport
they play it at my work, they've played it for diamond stores, and they played it for a high-quality soap dispenser
er
dish detergent
lol
So
uhhhh
if its the house I'm thinking of I know the neighbors
Ohhh
no
Don't know their neighbors
They are like a block away
I had to call a French store today, I dont speak french.

We'll just be criminals
I like to see the ground baby countries get their butts kicked by countries that play legitimately
(Ground babies: Mexico, Argentina, Spain, Italy)
<<< lost it lmao that is my new term for said countries
there's like nobody at work today
only 2 programmers, including myself
lol
colors are hard
need help nao?
Possibly
I drew up some designs on paper and need to translate it to photoshop
and come up with a color scheme
Is it possible for me to make a bar that is like 48dp in thickness with photoshop?
idk how dp works
dp?
don't know why they call it DP, it's a pixel
so 48 dp = 48px etc.
hmm
wait yeah dpi it immediately translates into px
48 seems really tiny on a 1080x1920 display
I am bad at typing today
keep in mind mobiles are about 600
and tablets are over 600
Earlier I said "I will be WTF for the rest of the day - available by hipchat/email"
when I left work
lol
great
and people were like "you okay? why you wtf?"
lol
600?
that's what the site says
like 600 pixels?
yeah
that can't be right
"handset"
my screen is 1080x1920
it's what it says on the site you linked
I dont think that translates straight to pixels
well maybe not
buuut it did translate perfectly at ooooooooh
it's 48px at 72ppi
that might help
apparently the nexus 5 is 445 ppi / xxhdpi
because i don't see any conversion table
jeeeeeeebuuuus
lol too high for that calculator
yeh
dp
Density-independent Pixels - an abstract unit that is based on the physical density of the screen. These units are relative to a 160 dpi screen, so one dp is one pixel on a 160 dpi screen. The ratio of dp-to-pixel will change with the screen density, but not necessarily in direct proportion. Note: The compiler accepts both "dip" and "dp", though "dp" is more consistent with "sp".
aha
so since the nexus 5 has a 480 dpi screen, 1 dp = 3 px
ahah thank you
i need to come up with a logo
pen and paper still recommended
initially yeah
is this your personal project?
At some point early next week I need a digital copy
it's the HistoGraph thing
I can do a quick freebie with no revisions if you want
sure
ok what do you want
I have no clue
lol
$5
lol
I'm not sure how to turn this in to an icon/logo
lol all I'm thinking is a histogram over a graph that's colored or something
oh my lol
Well, it should be simple, and work as both a logo and app icon with only minor adjustment
recognize the logo I'm thinking about?
haha
the app doesnt use histograms though
it uses line charts
lol we can make that look like a histogram
?
make a line chart look like a histogram?
yeah you just fill in the bottom
histograms aren't always bars
but then it doesn't relate to the app
histograms are category/quantity maps
so what d you want the logo icon to look like
whereas a line graph is usually a time/quantity
It should be simple, and maybe have 1-2 letters
like HG
although that makes me think of HGTV
which is bad
maybe a graph angled to the left a bit
with a line on it
here if you can give me a simple "this is what I want" description thing, I'll do it
I'll think about it after I get these page layouts done
k
Well
my radiator is fixed
woo
all you need to do is crack an egg in it! mythbusters proved this ages ago!
I needed a new radiator
lol
not a 3 hour patch job
m31
wat is robocraft?
oh btw, the SE server should be updated to the latest release
woo
Design: going from "I want this!" to "I want what I like!"
more like this for me: "I want this!" to "I no longer want that but now I do not know what I want"
^
"I want a cutting edge design that shows robust circuitry and a connection to humanity."
"I like puppies. Make it a puppy."
this might be a cool logo/icon: an angled smartphone with 1's and 0's entering it from the left and a graph exiting it on the right
might be too much though
guise
robocraft
play it now
wat is it
looks fun
that would be cool
would it have enough fidelity to display clear on a phone?
that's what I'm wondering
you know on android gmail the little mail icon in the top left next to the 3 vertical bars that open the side menu?
that's where this icon will be
square?
yes, 144x144 px
where 3x3 = 1 px
so basically 48x48 scaled up 3x
may be too complex
probably
the phone could just be a vertical line and not a phone i guess
or the 1's and 0's could be eliminated
ideally it should have a strong left edge
so that it kind of lies on the 3 bars
you know it might not be limited to 48x48 scaled up
you might be able to use the whole 144x144
idk
@_@
u pay me now
lol
you take jamaican dollars?
yus
well too bad, my jamaican money has sentimental value
lol
that's what I have so far
icons are just what I could find online
suggestions if I may?
gopher it
distance walked: either a speedometer or footprints
yeah, they didnt have those icons
lol
lol
footprints would be ideal
well damn isn't that amazing
I am.
I come to you for programming, you come to me for graphic stuff.
ANY graphic stuff
lol
I have a ridonk amount of resources.
does screen usage track your eye movement?
actually data usage you could use the speedometer
screen usage is when your screen is on
which actually doesn't make much sense from a graphing point of view
you could just have a glass panel
screen usage would be better as a histogram, but I wasn't planning on implementing any more than line graphs for this demo
I'll leave it in this image though. Multiple graph types is possible as a future thing
k, changed those two
woo
that analytics icon isn't bad
I'd cut the monitor stand off the bottom
use the site man
they have things somewhere
the logo icon could use some color i think
dig it
Also I kind of the "GraphIt" as an app name
lol
use it
simple and bitesized
yeah
anyways
I am trying to stick to the native android look, but it seems too simple
not enough color variation
too empty in the top right, too
Guys
Nobille is under the watch of Beelzebub
she is summoned by the lord of the flies
at least she isn't summoned by the lard of the fries
Fair enough
Is it poutine or just fries? Cause if its poutine I would rather be summoned there
just fries

Where are the swastikas?
it's still a WIP
Oh okay
I can forgive that then
DUUUUDE
wtf
wut
What happened
shrike and some other guy built that in T2
Krash and Shane*
krashan
i knew he had an sh in his name
yeah, shrike didn't play t2 con
shocking considering the name
he did play t2
just not construction
how to play sims
apparently
I would
lol you would
That's what I said
so I just watched Stranded
it was remarkably bad
what is stranded?
a movie
and it is terrible
why did you watch it
i was looking for a movie on netflix
you poor soul
watch Kill la Kill
wait it's anime
you'd hate it intrinsically
nevermind
It was terrible but I figured I'd watch it to see how it ends
spoiler: it doesnt end
let me guess
it just leaves everything hanging
he gets stranded :O
nope
what misfortunes happen upon our hero?
an alien impregnated the woman, came out, killed people, escaped to earth
wut
didnt kill all the people
two of them got rescued last minute by a shuttle
Watch Lawrence of Arabia
the goal was to watch a good scifi or horror movie
lol
are the real cars amazing
?
dunno, havent tried them
I did come up with a new design for the large ship though
i got lazy painting it
anyways off to bed
night
night
discovered skyrim
guess I won't see you guys in 2 years
good luck on your journey, Dovahkiin
woo I got hello world working on android :D
woo
i just realized I was going to eat ice cream last night and then I forgot to :(
this is a tragedy
lol only if you thawed it, is it a tragedy
no, it didn't all melt. I just didnt eat any
refrozen ice cream is actually pretty good though
OH GOOD FUCKING GOD
-_-
I need to learn to save more in Skyrim
seriously
lol
i hat eme
I just foudn the stones that grant 20% faster level up
vgca http://i.imgur.com/ef31wsj.jpg
lol
so since the asteroid field idea didn't work out, I think when we move to a new map I'll just generate a large single asteroid for us to build a base in
why don't we just do creatives?
like racing on tracks
fighting custom ships
maybe one large vs few small
a few reasons
in creative, you have no drive to innovate and make new machines that server a direct purpose to survival
and creative doesn't force you to cooperate towards a single larger goal
We kinda already "beat" survival. Repeating it doesn't seem like too much fun.
the lack of a goal or any real sort of obstacle makes it get dry very fast
^ by that logic, creative wont last long
and with creative there's no reason to have a persistent server
True.
any of us can host it and others can just paste in vehicles
We could each host games
yeah
no need for a server
i view creative as more of an instance based thing
Yeah.
you throw it up, have some fun, and then it's done
Yeahhhhh...
(on the new survival map we'll have easier modifiers btw)
lol I'm not disagreeing with you on any of these points
I'm worried that'll make us "beat" it faster.
It will also let us get more done. less grinding
Refineries/assemblers will likely be at 3x speed, inventory at 5x size, and welding at 2 or 3x speed
lol
less grinding
same as what I've stated
always with the grinding
I'm worried that we'll beat it faster
well, it's not about beating
it's about setting a goal and reaching it, then moving on to a new goal
meanwhile more features get added to the game
At it's current state, Survival has lost my interest. We kinda blew through everything we needed in a week or so.
"finishing" an asteroid base isnt a small task really
we only even explored a small part of survival though
there are multiple ways we could play it
I'll think of some more instances we could do; those I'd liek to pursue.
we could limit ourselves to only use small ships, for example
I still want to figure out an Ender's Game scenario.
or, make an asteroid base, or enable meteors, or disallow raiding of ships so we have to become miners
or maybe a "bossfight"
or we could have a team pvp thing where we can't use actual weapons
so we have to design our own projectiles
(which would be just as fun in creative)
^
I was gonna say, that interests me in creative
yeah
on a survival server it'd be a function of time more than anything else
yeah
maybe a ship racecourse...
in that case since the end state is just destroying everything, maybe not so great for survival
lol
it's a lot like our old mc servers though
creative servers never lasted long
it'd be better if combat wasn't so broken lol
creative died I think because of griefers
and whiners
and everyone building what they wanted after 2 days
¿Todos nosotros los Americanos hablan Española, correcto?
¿Alguien?
¿Hola?
ihola!
still on the survival server?
I want to do ship battle :<
almost 100 hours nao well done
lol
I just switched to my crative server for a sec
marking alternate blocks of the ship with different colors so i can actually count length in my reference screenshots
so I downloaded and installed Roboto (the font) and now anything which uses that font on chrome looks terrible
D: scybreak uses roboto slab
i didn't realize until yesterday that roboto is the official android font
and today I see it is used like everywhere due to it not rendering properly now
lol
pretty good progress for today
got rid of the old middle section and got part of the new middle done
Just so everyone knows: I shut down the dedicated server for the night. Nobody really uses the server from 2am through 5pm, so I'll just start the server when I get up and take it down when I go to bed, so my laptop can rest
sounds good
and that is making sweet progress
why is everyone in Skyrim saying I look ill
is it because I'm a wood elf
racists
vvn you may have some ailment or disease
o.o I didn't know that could happen
yeah there are a few diseases.
a cure all should probably fix that
oh wow lol brain rot
hahaha
where did you see it?
wait temples have cure-all idols?
wow
in magic "active effects"
hmm I'm not sure I think the temple should have a healer
kek skyrim also doesn't like alt tabbing
yeah apparently any temple has a cure all
or maybe a blessing
yeah...
Temple fixes all problems
Disease?
Fixed
Wounded?
Fixed
lol it did
Need a buff?
Fixed
Netherlands won 3rd place 3-0 vs brazil
lol
lol
Netherlands should have been playing tomorrow
I'd think so, but they should have played like they played today against argentinia
True
o well life goes on xD
I want to see a like 12 - 0 German victory tomorrow
haha
lol
oh neder went against brazil?
laaaaawwwwl
like a massive floor mopping
yeah 3-0 too
laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaawwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwl
if ever there was a time to say rekt
it is now
Brazil doesn't do well anymore because they can't hack in that game
lol
buncha hacks apparently
well maybe they should clean up that dirty water in the bay...
Nah
no eco friendlyness
just
Factories
fill the bay with so much plastic that you'll be able to walk from one side to the other
"What's that? the billions of dollars we poured into hosting the world cup instead of using it on our infrastructure was all for naught?" "I see no negative consequences to this."
lol
They should just pull a dubai and turn their trash into islands
lol
Time for the riots to recommence
hi
so, I just got back from gun shopping
decided on the Smith and Wesson M&P Pro 9mm
Wasn't that similar to the one I suggested?
i forget what you suggested
It was an old s&w version that my dad got as his service pistol for the chp but they no longer sold them and I think the m&p was the new version. His was a compact 40 though
I liked how this one felt in my hand, very comfortable handle
and it looked cool
Can I get a tl;dr on the last few days? Also yeah that's what I liked about his compact 40. It has a lot of vert kick because of the nature of a compact but with the pro 9mm you shouldn't have any problems with that
yeah, 40 is a lot more kick than 9 mm
1 sec brb
Lol k
Yeah and compacts just go crazy because they have no barrel whatsoever practically
k back
so, past few days.... hmm
Totally wanted to do back flips when Alex tried shooting my dad's 40
Well, I decided to remodel my big ship on space engineers
That sounds expensive lol
Did you finish the hull?
that's where it is at as of last night
Very pretty
How is the interior?
this is the finished hull design in creative: http://cloud-4.steampowered.com/ugc/7917943306266/F922A93438CCD34BB801EB7826DA0C67/
erm
those links are wrong
Lol yeah I get the gist though
That's the current progress?
there fixed
yeah
Very nice
puting in the new front then i'll go back and tweak the back such as the bridge area
more consistent style this way
Yeah it seems nicer
I miss my computer :(
lol
Still in Chicago for another week
It's nice and decently fun but meh
so
are we going shooting?
I'm going shooting with my bro/parents tomorrow
How much did you gun cost you?
uhhh
$600 i think
Not bad
yeah
came with night sights
progress: http://cloud-4.steampowered.com/ugc/7913060076635/112E2CF91D238F7D1E7FFFB90816CAB7AFB71454/
noice
about the gun imean
lol and the ship
FUR DEUTSCHLAND!!!!!!!!!!!
BLAAAAAHAHAHAAHAHA
LOL
JAAAAA
EAT THAT SOUTH AMERICA
Die nationalmannschaft!
lol first win in south america or a european country
for*
That's right south america
u smell
of drugs
and poverty
and corruption
oh shit is it over?!?
yes
lol 1 and 0
yeah
How do you guys live in this heat?! I'm dying up here
it was like 109 *f here today
Just checking my phone for celcius
cause farenheit is stupid
so you were ten degrees hotter
HOW
DO
YOU
LIVE
we stay in the shade mostly
and avoid going outside
my inside is warmer than it is outside :(
Which of you has the canadian girlfriend? I wish to ask my comrade how she has adapted.
that would be andrew
Could you pass along my question if I miss him?
sure
I dont trust Ian he'll just call the whambulance
she spends most of the year in reno though, where it isnt so hot
Whambulance
oh xD
she went to highschool in vegas though
It gets hot like this here normally, but we are lacking the strong winds that normally accompany the heat
I am moments away from finishing the outer hull of my ship :D
Hull finished :D
gotta add some gyros and a reactor, then it will be flyable
I want to make a dragonian master sihp
whazzat
I didn't know Alex was Canadian
A large ship
made to look like a dragon
is it like an actual thing somewhere or just generally large ships that look like dragons?
I've been playing skyrim a lot
I want a dragon shaped ship
I am sick :(
not an actual thing
why are you sick deco
Dunno
I caught my sisters cold
its no bueno
lol
my ship is almost done :D
well.... the entire interior needs to be made
haha
but the outside is done!
I want to build a fancy high tech space station
I plan on doing a new map after this ship with just one large asteroid
and making an asteroid base
with 10x inventory and 3-5x weld speed
haha
That would make things faster
to work on big things
this ship has taught me: aint nobody got time for welding thousands of steel plates
and why not many asteroids?
and sure as hell nobody got time to weld hundres of ramps
more asteroids = takes longer to join the map
I tried to generate a map with 50 asteroids
didn't look particularly impressive and took AGES to join
just do like? 20?
that's what we have now
o
It'd be better ot have one extra large one I think
(like the size of 20 all smushed in to one giant one)
one extra large one with a prettier skybox
yeah
super high tech asteroid base
the handheld drills will actually be useful then :p
Any stargate mods yet? :P
maybe, modding is still a WIP though
just custom blocks at this point
ah
Seen it, would buy if I could run it
lol
it's pretty fun
still needs a lot more work but it's at a point where it is enjoyable
how does it compare to gmod, propwise? stable?
well, my gmod experience can be divided in to two sections:
lol
1. I build a flying machine out of balloons on single player
2. I join a multiplayer server and see nothing but big red flashing error messages
yeah that pretty much sums it up
lol
SE has a few physics/multiplayer bugs
like... trying to tow another ship using landing gear locks is a bad idea
that's how I managed to obliterate deco's build ship
haha oops
lol
suddenly we spin at like 9000 RPM and the hold breaks, and his ship goes flying off at 70 m/s towards the map border
(without any power to stop itself if I even managed to get in the cockpit)
Lol
so yeah 10/10
Looks like a great game, well much more potential to be creative
it's pretty fun, lots of creative ideas in the community about how to make cool devices
using rotors as pistons for big blast doors and such
you need a computer that can play it so you can join us!
Yeah I need to get something to hold me over for the next 10 years
I can barely (not really) run skyrim on potato mode
lol
Recently had to replace the cooling fan in the laptop
No smoke yet so I must have done something right :p
haha
lol
I noticed my laptop, which was hosting the SE server, was blowing out super hot air
even with a cooling pad under it
yeah right now with these summer temperatures i've got a cooling pad and a fan blowing on it
these things are reallybuild for airconditioned roms
rooms*
well, luckily I don't really use my laptop much any more so I can let it rest in peace
This laptop is from  I think, cooling has gotten better but it's still not optimal
Yeah the best would be an actual pc
you can get good specs pretty cheap
I was suprised how reasonable it was for the specs I wanted
Yeah my parents did that
Granted in that humid, tropical ocean air, they've had 5 motherboards in 3 years so far
maybe less lol
x_x
lol
but more than you'd think reasonable
nothing to fancy, just basic mobo
I've only had to replace a mobo once, and that was because I was shipped a dead one from the start
Fan cooled?
yeah
ah
I posted a pic on /r/buildapc and everyone was freaking out since I have the stock intel CPU cooler lol
lol
rather than one of those giant brick heat sinks or water cooling
it works fine though
Water cooling scares me
there are nice cpu water cooling kits that are really easy to set up
and it's usually some non-conductive fluid rather than actual water
so if it leaks it isn't usually catastrophic unless it gets in the HDD
ah that would make sense
I think i'll look into it
so, my desk is almost finished now :D
*command center
2 more edge pieces to glue on for the desk top, then two panels for the bottoms of the legs, and it'll be ready to stain
*battle station :p
custom desk?
yeah
Nice
my dad's doing most of it cuz he's good at that
I'm just helping with gluing it all and such
ah :P
it's nice and big
32 inches deep, 6 feet 6 inches wide
something like 36 inches tall i think
pretty good size
yeah
Dual screen?
triple :p
D:
Well it's becomming more the norm
having triple 1080p screens at home makes this single <1080p laptop screen difficult to use at work
haha, lack of space
I could go dual but I use the other screen as my tv
saves the videocard from overheating
lol
common occurance :P
If I were to hire you/your dad to make a custom desk how much would that cost me? Lol my desk is pitiful :/
you could buy my old desk
lol
Your old desk was really nice
i doubt my parents want to haul it back to vegas
Well I'm driving down to Vegas maybe I can get it back up in my parents car or something. How much?
Oh right it's still in reno
lol
Lol nvm on the car part
idk how much, I'd have to ask my parents
Gotcha. Well bbl again lol much busy in Chicagoland
wait
wait
courtney asked me to ask you to ask alex how she managed to adapt from canada temperatures to vegas temperatures
curses! I was too slow!
I have failed you, Courtney
Now I must commit sudoku
lol
g'night gotta sleep
night
Sudoku
yup
puzzling
the ship now has gyros, storage, full thrusters, refineries, assemblers, and power
though I still need to add more storage and a conveyor system to link everything
ooo
So
I am playing KSP
I somehow got a jet powered thing
into space
I lost control of it
and it kept going
then the engines cut out
and it had enough momentum to reach orbit
wat
it flies!
but i just saw dark smoke clouds so maybe it doesn't fly much
oh shit i just tried flying it with a construction vehicle still sitting undocked inside of it
dat ms paint
(is still way better than I can do using any other software)
wut
wut
Turkey with pidgeon feathers?
clearly it's an aligator with velociraptor feathers
Ah yes
Dinosaur feathers
recently discovered
so, I built a tiny little build ship just now to assist with welding stuff inside my ship
How tiny?
it's pretty much a cockpit, large cargo container, and a welder
in small ship form
Large cargo?
+ engines and stuff to make it work
That's pretty big
nah
it is able to fly around the inside of my ship pretty easily
"The Arm"
Now you need
"The Legs"
i named it "Mike Rowe"
haha
it kinda accidentally has a swastika
Heil
Swastikas, geometrically speaking, are very useful
I just had the best lunch ever in a town that describes itself as "lesbian friendly"
andrew andrew andrew
courtney asked me to ask you to ask alex how she managed to adapt to vegas temperatures from canada temperatures
Oh yeah I saw that yesterday but forgot to reply. Alex said it was so traumatic that she doesn't remember. (Not really, she left in the summer and it was actually better in Vegas because less humid)
oh also
my parents said they would sell my old desk for $50
woo
KSP update is supposed to come out soon
why does it take 3 people to tell me if the art is good
what in the hell
what's KSPs update?
and has anyone tried the "realistic" cars yet?
in spess?
no
lol
Also
Does that work?
Oh, and the KSP update has contracts and reputation
i've seen videos about the new wheels, they seem cool but i dont have any need for wheeled vehicles
and other stuff
so i haven't used them myself
I am entirely unable to focus on work right now... so I think i may play more space engineers..... >_>
SPACEEEEEE
big ship is up to 12 large containers and 2 refineries now
lol I want to make a racetrack
You want to have.....
a Space Race?
Oh yeah
and the KSP update
contains 64-bit support
lol yes yes i do
i also want that dogfight
lol I've been listeing to that and the one that came out today
word crimes
i'll have to see that one
oh my god
word crimes
i sthe best
lol
still 6 more new ones coming up
can I rant?
I need to rant
first of all
someone actually sent me all the logos in word
I shit you not
that happened
second
all the photos in their ftp are of sportsbooks
they said photos of casino games would work
i asked if they had any stock photos
so they sent me the same ftp
done
sorry
I know
#designerproblems
...now to be the dragonborn or to make a dragon ship...
Dragon born is cool. Dragon ship sounds cooler. Like the wyvern I made on that creative deal we did
I would definitely buy that desk for 50 bucks if I can get it to fit somewhere. And if I can't get it to fit somewhere we could probably use it as a TV stand
guacamole
sounds good
so i have a bunch of room inside my ship, but idk what to put in it
i need a medical thing for respawning and thats about it
get tired of browsing reddit on my left screen... better start browsing reddit on my right screen
>_<
kek
yup
first interior room is starting to take shape: http://cloud-4.steampowered.com/ugc/75750817171130754/3674714C87F08F2D19937726CACE8654906D7708/
it's one of the bunk areas
the lack of interior items makes decorating hard
THAT'S ACTUALLY COMING ALONG NICELY
lol ignore the caps
dammit
well i'm gonna leave it
I'm glad you're so excited about the ship, tony
lol
i think saying polite comments in all caps should be a thing
lol
YOU HAVE A LOVELY HAT
YOUR FLOWERS ARE COMING IN NICELY
THOSE CURTAINS TIE THE ROOM TOGETHER
I just read all of those with a "DAYUMM" in front
lol
Where's the fire? I hear people screaming about flowers and hats
lol
lol you guys see the new weird al video today?
not yet
he's picking some good songs to go off
yeah, tacky/happy has been stuck in my head :(
lol yeah
in fact I am listening to it right now
i love how he has cameos in his videos
was that guy in Tacky Jack Black?
yup
and that female was a comedian
in the elevator
the director in Foil with the clipboard was ... I forget his name but he's a comedian and voiced Remi in Ratatoiulle
oh and the two guys who took him away in Foil were teh cops from Reno 911
I have my android app running on my phone :D
it doesn't do anything yet, but it looks nice
lol
<my website
I found a theme for jQueryMobile called NativeDroid
it basically does all of the formatting for me
and adds cool stuff like cards
just realized something
I've always wanted to design a web app / mobile app but I didn'
t know how to go through the process
cordova/phonegap (let's you make android/ios/wp/blackberry/etc apps with html/css/js) is nice
it has a few limitations
but it is easy
it's all pretty easy assuming you don't need to make an api for database usage and stuff
lol
(that's why I redesigned my app to not use a web api)
(aintnobodygottimeforthat.gif)
did your app still need a designer?
it basically designs itself with this theme
lol ok
using the light/blue theme
dude no joke
so now the question is...
cordova or phonegap lol
same thing
lol
phonegap is powered by cordova
is there any programming possible?
what do you mean?
I am starving but I have a meeting in 28 minutes :<
oooh food truck tacos today
afk
lol
i mean does it only display splash pages etc.
it is literally just a bare bones web browser with access to phone hardware apis
so, anything you could do with html/css/js
ahah...
What I was getting at a few lines up is that I'd like to design something so I could use it for my portfolio.
And say "I've designed for mobile applications"
well, phonegap is pretty easy
it's quite different than native android/ios development though
these tacos are good
kinda plain but good
lol
aaaaaaaaaaaaand look what I found https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yis7GzlXNM
lol
i dont know why my partner's name is so hard to remember
I just refered to him as "him" in my meeting
lol
PD or something wasn't it?
he wasn't there
philip uhhh
Partner Dude
something
DAvis
yes
there you go
lol
so this theme is nice but it has some bugs
and is very big
it would probably be easier to just make this in pure java
so I just launched a virtual android device using Android L on accident...
Android L is weird
does the L stand for weird?
apparently
ok so amnesia night
does starting at 9 seem reasonable?
we'd likely be up pretty late if we want to finish it in one go
yeah...
ok the last one to join is ok with missing it for the first 3 hours
she can only be there at nine
kosher?
sure
ok
bbl, heading home
k
hilarious
?
you go there to appeal a console ban
and the cold robotic responses of the support staff make me giggle
"Gamertag xXFuckDaPoliceXx was banned I don't know why please help."
"*laundry list of reasons why you dun' fucked up*"
lots of "my brother used this account and now it's banned"
funny. i'd expecct cousin to be most common
lol
hah wait are we speaking from actual experience?
not really
there have been a few times while admining T2 and MC where people blamed the cousin
seems to be far more common that brother
cousin seems oh so plausible
because if they had a brother they'd clearly mention it
i've heard both dad and step-dad too
or it'd be the brother they never mentioned which would be suspicious
lol
"my dad was the one who called him a faggit not me"
lol
oyyyyyyyyyy
"my dad said he had sex with his mom, not me!"
lol
ok that one has plausible deniability
so, the med lab is now done and an office room is also almost done
is there a science room?
not yet, but that's a good idea
also maybe a "reactor room"
ships ....I had a list somewhere
Med Bay
Science Lab
Mess Hall / Eatery
Sleeping Area
Hangar
Cockpit / Bridge
Teleportation Deck
Armory
Comm Room
I have most of those planned
Probably won't have a teleport deck just because I couldn't make that actually do anything teleporty
science lab could have a cool rotory contraption of some sort
lol
immediately thought of that
lol
there's a "hidden" feature of rotors
you can do some really hacky derp job on it and then it will let you attach small ship blocks to a large ship rotor
....hmmm
hit tiny ships with other tiny ships
it's bulletproof
SCIENCE TRIUMPHS AGAIN!
HAS SCIENCE GONE TOO FAR
FIND OUT NEX TIME ON ANOTHER EXCITING EPISODE OF SPACE ENGINEERS ZED
lol zed
man building the interior is a pain
400l of inv space is tiny
skyrim bugs
why
Because you don't have the skyrim bug patch mods installed
are those actual things?
handy I'm not a fan of
Yeah they're real. Easy to use and install and stuff with a quick tutorial too
Just use the nexus mod manager and go to skyrim nexus for the mods
what do you think about Elder Scrolls online?
meh
I'd love to play with friends but it seems like a watered down version of the game
skyrim, oblivion, morrowind
yeah :<
usual MMO shenanigans
usually when I play MMOs there's one pro player who just helps the other newblets get up in the levels lol
lol yeah
or like Thal that has you trailing behind without being able to enjoy the game
who*
lol yeaaaaah
thal: HURRY NO TIME
so tony
a few guys here play LoL, if you're still looking for more people to play with
are they super picky about rank/elo/etc? because I'm not even level 30 yet
one of them is pretty new
annnd do they need a support or adc?
the other guy seems like he's probably good
idk
lol
SE update today
added battery blocks and some tweaks
solar panels are also cheaper and better
woo ksp update
mainly good cause now its 64 bit
Does it run significantly better now?
nao^
i made a similar thing a while ago to help me design minecraft mob farms on a grid lol
lol
ooh, pistons are apparently confirmed for the next SE update
I can't stop listening to Foil.
But don't mind that.
I'm protected 'cus I made this hat
OF ALUMINUM FOOOOOIIII-ULLLL
lol
. . .
so my friend just got engaged at an In N Out
it's her favorite restaurant but my god
*forever alone :(
you're classier than that
Just need to find the right one
I think I'll try t pick up wood carving this summer
lol everyone knows that feeling man
"Hear is there mock up"
I AM 500-FUCKING% DONE WITH THIS
lol
I'm half tempted to link him to Word Crimes by Weird Al
You lost me
oh there's a song called Word Crimes done by an artist named Weird Al Yancovic
he parodies hit songs
Word Crimes is about proper grammar
Which my correspondent just violated with a pitchfork
ah haha
Me... started up my page maybe a year ago
115 likes
Friend... started up his page 2 days ago
153 likes
Yup the world is as such
uh oh
screen is "out of range"
lol nevermind
lol
I never liked wireless
that's the weird thing, it's wired
i just turned it off and on
weird error
hmm odd
oh my god
"stick with are dimensions
he better be using voice-to-chat
Damn it's hot here
How'd I ever live in the tropics
lol
what time is it there?
in the netherlands 23:33
Is that where you're at currently?

well nevermind that makes sense
I thought it was morning still -_-
haha
Now it's morning
1:40 am :P
lol
I haz new mic
so
hopefully no more monster
woo!
or maybe doing that just offended the monster and made it angry
Bom Diddy Bom di rangatang tikitiki Billy Billy Billy da bomb bomb the boogy
bah ra da ba da 'rangutan tiki tiki billy billy billy da bom bom da boogie
Lol

i commend you for trying that all out on mobile
so guys
today I spent 9 hours in one big meeting
it was boring
o.o
Thank you :) lol I miss my computer
9 hours?
Wow
9 hours
this weekend was the Originate Attack
ooohhhh
What is that
mansion/partying last night, then a big meeting today from 10 to 6
Aha
Sounds fun
And then boring
then more mansion/partying tonight but I opted out of that
what
mansion/partying
what what what
what
yeah man
we're like practically rock stars
didn't you know
Parties are
Gross
honestly
lol
People are boors
I didn't stay there over night
and completely uncivilized
to be honest
it wasn't bad
work party, so I got to meet a lot of people i've been working with through the internet
I go to parties only if they have a black tie dress code
ahhh
+ i got better at the fooz
the mansion's main attraction is a super nice pool
so no black ties there
dude
dood
that's beast networking
also uber jelly
lol
metal grids y u so massive
i met a guy at the mansion who plays minecraft
he was quite impressed by my 400 subs
xD
lol
does he want to be a doctor?
also is it actually a mansion
oh hey it's your peeps' anniversary
tell 'em I said grats
it is actually a mansion
the neighborhood looks like crap though
lol
doesn't matter, I still am super jelly
I had to drive 3 people from the NY and Israel offices there
they were like "you arent actually going to kill us right?"
lol
because it was just this shitty neighborhood with bare desert blandness everywhere
lol
GUH
I WANT A FUN JOB GOD DAMMIT
one where people aren't tards
-_-
I HAVE THE SPEEEED
whatthefuck
wat
bro, do you even terabyte?
lol
so I guess I'm going to be my bro's best man at his wedding
saw that coming
lol
also DAMN SON
...what's his wedding even going to be like?!
i dunno
i imagine non-traditional
I'd imagine so
gonna be a big party lol
is there a date?
some time in april  i think
what should I build in spess :<
build an array of small battery powered work ships
and a charging station
do batteries just need to be charged and that's it?
no uranium?
correct
solar panels can charge them
lol useful now
yeah, solar panels are more effective and cheaper now
I just washed my keyboard
In water
those are the best :D logitech
Yup!
You have one as well?
i've still never actually washed mine
lol
lol i do
sat it overnight
it was weird but then i was like "oh sonice"
I just washed mine with plain ol' soap and water
worked 100%
with the dishes
i don't think you're actually supposed to use soap lol
lol
you're not >_>
I used dawn
and clearly
In russia we wash mother board with soap and water... is like new
my keyboard still works
I only got soap on the key sufaces though
not on the actual black part
if that makes a difference
interior walls of my ship are all done :D
just gotta do the inside of a few rooms
why not just build it in creative and import it?
because that would kind of defeat the purpose of building a survival ship?
but
it takes so long
it's much more rewarding when you make progress though
that counts as science right?
yes
"science"
it simulates.....
...
zero gees
... in space
lol
in this environment of artificial gravity
first spinny chair I've ever seen
It simulates... spinning really fast
well there is a large battery in front of it
maybe spinning by a large battery can polarize your anti protons
if you could just.... counteract the resonant frequency of the energy waves
Ah
But what if the anti-graviton flux modulator polarizes protons and not anti protons?
The spinny chair would be all for naught.
then we'll have one hell of a problem on our hands
lol
I see you all read Pseudosceince monthly
Pseudoscience Quasitronly
If we act quick enough we could just reverse the spin on the chair's rotational frequency
actually I'm just rewatching star trek voyager
Only if the biometric reversal switch responds to our thermal signatures.
If it doesn't we can access the maintenance hatches and do it manually
we'll just need to bypass the tricouplic bindings
Find a guy in a red shirt, he'll get it done right.
phew, I'm in a black suit
so, only major thing left is the bridge
then everything will be done
just needs a nice coat of paint after that
brandosis
tell yer mum to answer her phone
actually better yet
I have a friend who wants to rent a place out and I know she may ahve something available so do I have permission to pass along her number?
my mom is napping
this freaking spinny chair
it is the nearest recharge point to where i am building
and it is nauseating
i guess it's the nauSEAT
call it the U-seat
In a U-seat
N a U-seat
so hooking all of these conveyor tubes up for the turret system is a pain
gotta do it all by hand in cramped crawl spaces
have you listened to Jackson Park Express by Weird Al yet?
lol no
there isnt a music video for it yet (if it's getting one at all)
it's very strange
the song
o.o
I'll have to check it out
in the style of Cat Stevens apparently
oh my lord 55 hours on skyrim
most played game ever D:
i feel useless
i've got 142 hours on SE lol
lol you can say you're creating things
you can say you're exploring a story
Skyrim is like a book you can play in
and go on murderous rampages in
>w<
gotta build 12 turrets and then the ship will be functionally finished
So for 2 quests, 2 separate people need a mammoth tusk
give to one
get prize
pickpocket mammoth tusk
give to second one
get prize
pickpocket mammoth tusk
sell mammoth tusk to quest giver
life is great
> get quest giver to attack you
> guards kill quest giver
> take mammoth tusk
lol
that happened with another quest
apparently I would've had to have killed him later
lol
his corpse is still on his doorway
i accidentally crashed the big grind ship into the fork
>_<
D:
took out all of its storage, reverse thrusters, and cockpit
big grinder got a dent in its armor and was otherwise unharmed
>stick a fork in it
>it's done
so, the ship is done now
i'll probably still make little aesthetic tweaks to the interior, but it done
woo
so you guys
ovens
you know how you can hear the flames woosh on for the heat?
Mai and I were baking cookies
Package said 8 minutes. We timed it for 7 because we can always cook for longer.
7 hits, I open up the oven and take them out. Mai says to put 'em back in.
So I do and give a sympathetic, "Sorry Jews!" and they go back in
Close the door, turn around, and say, "It's okay, I can say that. I have an oven."
Then we hear the flames ignite.
the oven was aiding your joke?
lol
"Good Guy Oven" ?
sounds about right
i am finally back in sactown
be back in reno on the 21st too
woo
woo
what's sactown
welcome back?
OH Sacramento
yes
sacramento
lol
i call it sactown
y it so quite in hurr?
shh! no talking in the library!
my ship is mostly done, andrew
orly
very cool
just gotta paint it now
that'll be fun lol
i'm halfway through dark souls finally
just beat Qualaag
hi
Hi Brandon
Hello Ian
holy hell
i duplicated our survival world as a creative world to have some fun in
then my ship's turrets started going to town on anything that didnt have me set as the owner
lol
lol
meow
woof
oink
i have to pack
again
:F
impressive
thanks
that is a beauty
interior looks great as well
only took about 100 hours to build, too!
lol
time well spent!
lol
did you see frankie's destiny video?
i did
i want that game
:F
i wish destiny was coming out for pc
me three
good news is that one tom clancy game that looks awesome IS coming out for pc
yeah
the district?
whatsitcalled
sounds right
is that it?
i can never remember
something like that
lol
The Division
yep
that's the one
lol
can someone tl,dr me The Division?
coop plus team based pvp
tom clancy, looks good
high tech weapons
open world ish
what's the hook?
awesome multiplayer experience
i'll youtube it
go for their e3 reveals
good video and it's real gameplay
E3 gameplay demo
thats the one
oh that's right city got taken over and it's rebels and stuff
basically splinter cell but newer and not shitty ubisoft
and less stealth
unless you swing that way
it cant be splinter cell without NVGs
i bet it has them
is that live?!
yep
like as in other people are playing or that's just exquisite dialogue?
not sure
probably exquisite dialogue because E3 people are usually campy
but wow omg
dude not bad
lol " 
Nobody speaks like this online...﻿"
yeeaaaaaaaaah
nice
not randoms, but if you have a group of friends semi-role playing, they do
lol yeah
yeah if you were getting paid to do that, or wanted to promote the role-playing capability of the game that is exactly how you'd sound
either that or they'd sound like peter dinklage
lol
i want apple pie
I want...
lots of stuff
I would like some key lime pie
and a lemonade
i want an apple pie and a snapple pie
a snapple pie?
oh my god snapple pie
Whats a snapple pie?
a discontinued seasonal snapple flavor
it tasted amazing
just like apple pie
crust and everything
but it was a drink
wut
"Lame Claim to Fame" is interesting
the video is insane
also
it was a liquid
that tasted
like apple pie to the dot
it was glorious
what
anyways
is imgur over capacity for anyone else
i forgot what that linked to
yes
lol
but yeah it was apple with cinammon and the crust just... gah
someone asked weird al on an AMA why he doesn't have an album called Weird Album
now I am kinda disappointed that he doesn't
XD
saw that
it's like the Susan Album Party
sus anal bum party
my desk is almost done :D
just needs stained
woo
so I just hedge-trimmed my extension cord
like you used hedge trimmers on your extension cord?
yeah
was it plugged in?
yeah
did it do anything cool?
or did it just cut?
made my hedge-trimmer stop working
no big spark or fire or anything?
nope
well that's kinda disappointing
just VRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRk~
yeah
if you're gonna destroy an extension cord you might as well create giant sparks in the process
I didn't know that destruction was part of the plan to be honest
lol
got in touch with the ad app peeps finally
turns out the guys who contracted THEM haven't gotten in touch with THEM yet
ok Mission Statement is hilarioius
eh I didn't really like it
more of a satire than a parody
just because I've dealt with people who could verbatim pull from that song and believe it's brilliant
yeah I know a few people like that
whelp, back in reno with the pc set up again
:F
welcome back
woo
danka
so since I'm waiting on people waiting on people...
what do
Bring them their orders... they're waiting too
*I can do puns me :D
hardy har
so good maybe you can give me tips
*ba dum tsh*
terrible
just terrible
er
what was that key combo to get the ` on top of a letter?
ctrl shift
or something
i dont think it works on linux
so i cant test
ùmm
ctrl shift ` followed by letter iirc
aha
that was weird
my chat was centered
lol
do ctrl+tilda+e
it centers your chat
not on linux
unless you're weird and on linux or something
lol
you still at work?
yeah
damn
working late?
working on android stuff
lol
no
lol
its only 4
hmm
so it is
feels much later
lol
i just ate dinner
i usually stay here till 5-5:30
righto
whatcha doing on android?
phone metrics tracking/graphing
oh right
your project
I'm working on the metrics list right now
and the toggle buttons for each
nice
but this stupid android debugger wont initialize
so I can't test
>_<
you forgot to hit "initialize"
either that or the world is ending
so i'm hoping there's an initialize button
there's a command line option to initialize
but it isnt fixing it
i gave up and just restarted android studio
well, it's been nice knowing you all
(insert apocolypse here)
hmm
app crashed on load
i dont remember what i was doing before adb crashed
YESS i got the list highlighting working \o/
that only took like... 2 hours
woo
WOOOO I got saving of preferences working :D
just in time to head home
very nice
so what's everyone up to?
im home
and watching utoob
aha
you should come tour my space ship
whatcha watchin?
laststandgamers space engineers
aha
yeah
they're not bad
spetzy is much more inventive
better than guude/others
I'm wondering what to do
I swear the mindcrackers are TERRIBLE at this game
debating hopping on steam or skyrim
TERRRRIBLE
they are
lol
get dark souls and play with me! :D
Guude needed to make a beacon to help milbee find his way back
so he gets on a ship with a beacon on it to build a beacon
instead of just boosting the range of that beacon
lol...wow
lemme guess: episode titled "rescue mission"
dunno
but he nearly finished building his beacon
and realized he put the reactor on wrong
so instead of just rotating it he destroyed the whole thing
i can't say i'm surprised
luckily milbee is at least not 100% stupid and managed to find his way back
...yeesh
that is not a statement most people use when describing milbee
Andrew we can do risk of rain
we COULD
but Dark Souls!
I am debating trying out CS:GO
that game seems interesting
and probably too competitive for me
lol
I bought it during the summer sale
yeah that's the main thing holding me back
lol try it and review it for us?
oh boy
I dont want to deal with SUPER competative teammates
ubisoft IS making the division
:F
is it Ubi Montreal?
i don't think so
then there may be hope still
lol
yeah all the articles i see point to it not being montreal
i also bought a batman game
arkham origins
you know what you didnt buy?
I could try it
ummm
i didnt buy....
half life 3?
dark soulsssssssssss
lol
it really is good
i promise
lol
i prefer dank souls
there are 12 s's in that
4 original doctors
12/4=3
I can do math.
12 s's
1 + 2 = 3
you can also do math
Andrew hasn't responded for 3 minutes.
I just wrote 3 sentences.
Three word sentence
andrew is dark soulsing
<<< Half Life 3 confirmed
"Our shields just dropped to 0. Each of those little ships is emitting an "interferometric pulse.
"interferometric"
lol
a pulse that can be measured in interferences
oh my god
wow
very impressive
So
Thal
was showing my how he wanted to change his website
and he asked me for advice
on design
guess what I did
swastikas?
Yes
haha
Like the smiley hitler-sun?
yeah
>requests mobile app screenshots
>get sent iPad app screenshots
I suppose iPad IS mobile technically but oy
what's wrong with that?
they want me to fit 2 devices with screenshots
in thsi ad
the examples they sent me were mobile phones
(of what they wanted)
whatever
who knows
maybe I'm being a whiny little brat expecting to have things handed to me
I'm just used to the luxury of specificity
And used to people telling me they want 12 apples and then  saying 12 green apples
i attempted space engineers with 10x and 3x inventory size
it was too weird
i had to go back to 1x
i felt like there was no reason to use weld ships with 10x inventory size
there probably isnt other than speed
i want to play war thunder
i want german jets so i can have the spaceplane when they release it
WAR THUNDER?
Have you updated?
nope
i'm also playing dark souls
oh
maybe tomorrow though :P
What do you have in the way of Germans?
i have t3/4 with a dora and some form of heavy fighter that i can't recall at the moment
my t3's include the fw190-a5 though
Ah
yeah
quite the grind left
I assume the Ho 229 will be after the t4 Me 410 B6
Been confirmed that next update Japan gets the Kikka and J7W1
Also I've really taken to Arma
I suck at infantry combat though
lol
I love helicopters, planes, tanks, and anti-machine weapons though
I'm good at all that
I can snipe too
Just
not firefight
in close quarters
0/10 cannot fight up close
I like infantry :D
do you haz arma?
BF3 and 4
arma is quite different
you have to deal with a terrible engine!
makes it much more challenging when people arent where they appear to be and you randomly break your legs on twigs
Arma's ballistics are fantastic though
Arma III is really quite good
lol
so I'm running out of stuff to do on SE now
I've basically built my ideal build/grind ships and my big ship is done
Play a differnet game for a while?
Well, thursday will hopefully add pistons
that should be fun
For 2-3 hours
nah, it'll let me make much better utility ships
I need a game I can play while watching netflix
other than SE
hmm
dark souls
i play while watching youtube
once you get the hang of it (which took probably 20 hours of play) it's actually not that hard
you still die, sure
but that's literally in the title of the expansion
"prepare to die edition"
planet explorers is 40% off
15 bucks
same as when it first came to open alpha :F
i made tiny weld/grind ships
i think that's about as small as I can get it with a large container
so, Originate offered me the ability to keep working for them remotely while in Reno
Awesome man :D
yeah, I will probably do that mostly and maybe work for Sushil like 2 days a week or something
Sushil is a bit... eccentric at times, but he's still a valuable person to have as a resource
anyways, I'm gonna head to bed
'night
nite
so ap, the ZiggyD RNG is real. During the last hour of his stream, i found two 6link chestpieces and the Mjolnir unique hammer
greetings doctors
you guys see the new mc snapshot?
nope
massive performance increases
like people are all going from 20 fps to 70+
with higher settings
it's pretty impressive
o.o
threaded chunk loading, no dark spots, and the culling code from pcoket edition
pocket*
so, it renders 40-60% fewer surfaces
that's impressive
also you can get mob heads in survival and you can make banners with customized designs
.....hmmmmm
wow, impressive drops m31
also getting mob heads is super hard
needs charged creeper to explode on mobs
charged creeper farm!
lol
#1 random mob farm with no guaranteed results!
but when it works... heads for days!
lol
getting a charged creeper in the nether would be cool
i imagine someone will make a crazy wither skeleton skull farm
then easy wither skulls
lol
yep
i can already imagine one
by someone I of course mean panda
we could be the first!
lol
before panda!
well it's just a wither skele farm that pushes them through a portal and then drop a charged creeper on them
just need to clear out a nether fortress, get them to aggro follow you into a hole, and use portals
so basically he just has to stick a creeper in the sky and a nether portal at the bottom of his skele farm
right
lol
zipkrowd already has their nether perimeter too
they probably already have one in the works
like
90% done
lol
what if you use portals into the end?
ender heads?
that too
as in end portals?
but i was thinking push wither skeles into the end with a charged creeper
why in the end?
that way no mob lag till you actually go in there
wither skele farming is manual anyway
so it wouldnt be super laggy
i wonder if mobs still run on the main thread?
they probably do
oh yeah and ap, mjolnir is like a 20+ exalt item
so HA
lol
damn
but you're gonna keep it and make a THOR character, right?
damn right
lol
i was drawing up the specs last night
those builds are so friggin expensive you might have to sell your mjolnir to use your mjolnir
nope
i can get almost all of my strength and int from the tree
templar?
yup
templar and marauder are really the only viable options for mjolnir builds from what i've seen
plus one of the corrupted 6-links is alredy the right sockets
wow
nice
the only problem with the build is going to be levelling it
because i wont be able to take all the good stuff till level 60+
to level stuff, you grind. like if you had an uneven surface, you would grind it down so it is level
mind blown
lol
i think i'm going to do the boring old flameblast+searing bond nonsense
because OP
lol yeah
they still havent fixed that combo
it really is TOO good
the only problem with my 6link though is that it's corrupted
what does corruption do?
so I can't reroll the stats on it
or the socket colors
it's basically mirrored
is there an upside to corruption?
yse
you get 6links
lol
ah
lol
well that's probably worth it
you can get white sockets
better implicits
or take uniques and make them rares
so you might not need to reroll it at all then?
or one sockets
or brick jewelry
it applies a random effect, sometimes good, sometimes bad
and when it's bad, you basically get a brick
lol
gotcha
lol
care to join me in levelling a new char?
i'd have to update and stuff lol
i havent played in like 4 months
:/
they're doing a 1 month race atm
quite fun
it's taking all the old hardcore and softcore league things and smashing them together, with a different combination every few days
nice
races were fun
atm it's nemesis and ambush
but really hard
it's more a league than a race tbh
isnt nemesis basically just part of the game now?
kinda
rares have a chance to have nemesis mods
but right now al of them have nemesis mods
but nemesis being on means they all do
gotcha
and some of them are "inner treasue" meaning they always drop a unique
oh wow
that'd be nice
fought 2 of those and got crappy uniques out of it lol
well, one isn't too bad
low level (as in no level) staff that gives a level 8 trap support to socketed gems
wow
quite good
that sounds really good for leveling
my uniques tab is almost full :D
item rarity on my arc trap ftw
which is how i got mjolnir... and ziggy was actively trying to chance orb gavels to get it yesterday
lol
that's funny
the funnier part is he had a higher chance to get it probably
maybe
just because you had so many more rng's it could be
his is just a flat chance
it's one of the shavronnes class of uniques, meaning you have a better chance to get struck by lightning than getting it
like .002% or something retarded
lol since ball lightning is going to be a thing, you might not be able to use that analogy now :P
ball lightning for the most part is actually kinda crappy
now that they balanced it yeah
but the accidental release version... dear god
lol
hehehehee <3
and i now have my two endgame skills
lightning strike and molten strike
i never could get into those melee based skills
dunno why
this kinda has to be melee
lol
well yeah
lol
i'm just more of a witch/spellcasting templar
k, dark souls time. only 1/4 the game til i get to play ds2 :F
122 leaving work today
?
122 degrees F
In Henderson
Its 116 at my house
D:
so hot
such melt
at least I haz airconditioning
Andrew:
War Thunder?
<.<
>_>
spess
<_>
>_<
<.<
I'm trying to design a cool multi purpose small ship
i started out as a warship
buuuuuut it's soooo weak
but it looks cool
so there
my large ship takes out the npc ships pretty easily
but if it went against a player built war ship it'd probably get creamed
lol
yeah...
so I've discovered that hybrid ships made of both large and small ship parts are in general a pain in the ass
THE BORG! Woo
i'm at the good part of Voyager now :D
lol
I just learned the point of inv windows
see through on both sides?
lol see through one side vs not seeing through
?
one face is clear, one's opaque, inv switches sides
oh, inverted
i could use that on my ship....
but i dont want to touch that with another welder or grinder ever
merging large and small ships is too much work
lol
so yeah the game is not designed to build a ship like this
i wish landing gear was less buggy and that having a ship latched to another via landing gear didn't make it fly all lopsided
yeah :<
assuming pistons really do come out tomorrow, I want to make a cool mining ship that latches to the surface of an asteroid and feeds a long mining tube down the length of it
nice
...general purpose ship or combat ship
big or small?
large
hmmmmmm combat
cool :3
you using the new pistons and stuff?
pistons are out?
nope
yeah, and blast door blocks
wat
update came out like an hour or two ago
cool
auto-thrusters without cockpits
we can now create lance ships i think
missiles
lol saw that
trying to think of use for blast door
oh my god I love contracts
"Hey here's stuff for an accident attorney"
More stopping power than hammertime
why can I not add multiple blocks to a block group
it doesnt append
the group will hold whatever was selected when you add it to the group
ahah thank you
sup
hi
I almost have my sqlite database hooked up for my app :D
woot
my client's in Canada
has been for the past week
hence zero communication :D
ah yissss pistons
lol
huh
tops out at 104.5
that is the speed limit
for ships
suits can go slightly faster so that ships don't become uncatchable
aww
lol ok
here I was thinking I needed more jets
did anyone want to try and shoot it down? en masse?
i could pitch my ship against it :D
i'm down
yours will probably take me from sheer firepower lol
mumble?
mine just looks cool
sure
blarg

Does anyone else HATE buzz words?
I think they produce a nice synergy
>.>
have you seen that weird al vid?
I hate that one
and "cloud-computing"
cloud computing is actually a think at least
synergy is just pure BS
And "[some noun]-solution"
and using ecosystem to refer to a workplace
[9:27:20 PM] Anthony Humphreys: have you seen that weird al vid?
Which vid?
The I hate that was to the word synergy
not your statement
the last of the 8 videos
Forward thinking consumer-centric solutions will formulate a synergistic economical greenery initiative.
i forget the title
[9:30:16 PM] Anthony Humphreys: Forward thinking consumer-centric solutions will formulate a synergistic economical greenery initiative.
Lets just create a motivation firm
We'll say whatever BS makes us the most money
We'll even make an excel file to help us find which words bring the most profit
lol
i always imagined Shriker to be a buzz word lover
he seems like that kind of guy
whenever I think of shriker I'm thinking of someone else
someone and shane
Where has andrew been all day
krash
krashane y eah
krash?
wat?
i have been hanging with the gf and playing dark souls
:F
i only have three major bosses til i beat the game and can finally play the game i payed 60 bucks for (dlc included)
woo
oh
nvm on the krash thing
lol
got that
but yeah
been busyish
once i beat dark souls i will have time to WT
^ @ian
anywho
time for bed
'night
nite
KSP
With realistic WWI engines mod
the engines suck
lol
If only I had a few million http://www.propstore.com/movie/stargate-sg-1/
no joke...
ugh. I'm testing something that is triggered by my phone's battery level changing. So i have to sit here waiting for it to drain
lol
ask around maybe?
"who's battery is dead" ?
run everything
all the apps
flashlight app on
i ran youtube/camera/internet/flashlight
lol
managed to drain pretty fast
make a power-sucker app
my goal is to suck as little power as possible though D:
ahhh
so this place has a secret item apparently - the "chick-a-waff-a-dopolis". I don't know if it is real or not and I'd feel like a 'tard ordering that if it isnt real
o.o
do it
brando
stuff
braaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaandon
hi
things?
Did you still want to hang out?
ᵖᵒˢˢᶦᵇᶫʸ, ᵈᵘᶰᶰᵒ ʷʰᵃᵗ ʷᵉ'ᵈ ᵈᵒ ᵗʰᵒᵘᵍʰ ﹕ᵖ
how did
?
nothing
i dunno what we'd do
either
but I still want to hang out
but it has to be at your house, yes?
ᴾʳᵉᶠᵉʳᵃᵇᶫʸ, ʸᵉᵃʰ
you're doing that thing
?
you know what
ᶦ ᵈᵒᶰᵗ ᵏᶰᵒʷ ʷʰᵃᵗ ʸᵒᵘ ᵃʳᵉ ᵗᵃᶫᵏᶦᶰᵍ ᵃᵇᵒᵘᵗ
lol shh
Good news guys!
Winter is back!
I'm only going to get one sunburn this year!
lol
(shit dude what do we do
fire pit?)
dunno, i am kinda tired already lol
so no go?
lol ok let me know if/when
your app work?
well, you see
I got the database all working and then decided to change how data polling works
in an attempt to reduce battery and storage usage
and make the app simpler overall
but
?
oh theres no more to it than that?
I had it at a point where it was very close to working and then went backwards
that's what that was supposed to say
ah
the tradeoff with this is, it isn't able to track as much stuff
only things that broadcast actions
like battery level
or screen on/off
better with more batt though, yeah?
?
the app
probably better with a longer battery life I assume since that's the option you went with?
well, i'm making an assumption that it'll be better
the previous method had a recurring background service that ran briefly every minute
now, it is a constantly running background service that just acts as a platform for hooking in to event broadcasts
so, it doesn't do anything unless it gets a broadcast, but it is always running
may or may not be better
but this way I only get meaningful data points
instead of a snapshot of possibly repeated data points every minute
for something like battery life, that means that the data set should be thin enough to retain a few years worth of data before needing to delete anything
the main reason for this change is that, reducing data points
the logic for compressing old data points to a smaller data set was killing my brain
particularly how to handle time zones and stuff
ahah
is Courtney still alive with her one sunburn?
lol yes
lol everyone's anonymous
"winter is back" ?
Yes its only been 10 degrees celcius today
all day
with a northern wind
oh my jeeze
o.o
you go out in that?
10c is only 50f
COLD
50 isnt that cold lol
60 I'm comfy at
rain is still water at that temperature!
50 makes me shiver
lol
It's averaged 47C this week Courtney
baaaaaaaaaad
i have so many tabs open that they dont even show icons or titles :(
lol still rain
but cold
lots of hail
I go out in -30 xD
o.o
-40, and 30 degrees, and im not comfortable or happy
too cold and too hot
30 is like a nice day for us
why the heck is this laptop so hot o_O
hey brandog
hi
hilo
howdy
how do you feel about us moving your stuff?
like
to the living room
if you want to
lol
lol
jared's lease is up already and he's gonna start moving stuff over so we want to try and fit things as nicely as possible
yeah
when is our lease up? august something?
i believe so
gotcha
theres something I have to sign in person though
to get removed from the resident list or whatever
yeah the new lease/removing you from the current lease
especially since you're the primary occupant at the moment
lol
when are you heading back up?
aug 17 give or take a day
gotcha, when does your new lease start?
aug 17
iirc
aha
makes sense
lol
yeah
lol
so guys, i only have two major bosses left in dark souls
then i get to (finally) play number 2
lol
which is nice considering the first dlc already came out
woo
well that was fun
i just redesigned a huge chunk of my app only to realize android won't let me do what I wanted to do
so then I had to revert all my changes
and now several hours later I am back where I started!
THATS EXACTLY HOW I FEEL
I just finished dark souls
and new game plus started
and i was like
wow, back where i started
this is kinda depressing
lol
but i am much excite
the last boss fight was tough as hell
died probably 20+ times
but yeah
now i get to ds2!
woo
but now i bed
goodnight
night
oh also good luck on that app :P
lol
lol
dude...yikes
also nao, awake?
i yam
you yam
mai and I are gonna run errands, the latter include lunch and China Town, didja wanna go?
nah, I have to do summer class work
JoAnn's and/or Walmart
ok
China town?
wat you getting there?
pig blood
wut
BLOOD OF THE PIG
Doing pagan rituals?
yes
oh
That makes sense then
yeah
can't do pagan rituals without pig blood
Yes you can
I use goat blood
doesn't that clog up your pagan vortex?
No, it just requires extra candles to keep the heat up
hmm good to know
Yeah, the goats blood is a little thicker, so its worth using
Newegg has the best returns I have ever seen for a website
I've discovered the trick to this women's study class
We have to have discussions every week and do at least two posts but you need to do more to get full credit
Its total bs?
so, I said that I don't identify as a feminist
and now everyone is commenting on it
and I just reply to them
Oh wow
lol
you should copy pasta it for us
lolol
I said I believe in equal rights, I just don't identify as a feminist
it isnt that entertaining to read, just lots of people saying that I am a feminist and I just don't know it
lol
lol that's what they all say
and then I say "but i dont hold women's rights above any other group's"
and bam, like 6 messages down
Huros you need to finish your skysrcaper on wtfcraft
lol
yeah
i like how you were typing for like a solid 50 seconds and then just said "lol" :p
Everytime I look at that thing I'm like I dunno what do
lol.. I was going to say something about feminism
lol
and equal rights. Often they do want the rights but they want the princess treatment aswell. Could be wrong
lol yeah
Some are more equal then others, komrade
Indeed
Been rewatching SGA lately
Wonderful show :p
I'm rewatching Voyager
I've been not watching TV :D
I just got to where 7 of 9 joins the show :p
Me neither, been using my tv monitor for the laptop
TNG and voyager are still too fresh in my mind
lol
I'm considering watching all of SG1, since I've never watched it end to end in order
and I know there are some episodes I missed
but it is SOOO long lol
There really isn't any show i've come across that gives the sg1/sga and star trek feeling. End of an era :(
yeah it's sad :(
lol yeah
that's why I keep rewatching them
lol
so many unanswered questions
Yup
It was lunch + cake
i've been watching house m.d. from the start
it is just as good the second time as the first
guys
i think i've fallen in love with mjolnir
mjolnir?
the armor or the hammer?
unique hammer in PoE
has a 50% chance to cast socketed lightning spells per enemy hit with attacks
lol ooh
lol uhh
lol poor wall-e
using lightning strike with chain and greater multiple projectiles and multistrike, so it hits about 24x3 times
jeeeeeeze
and i have a unique ring that lets me get power charges when i don't crit, and never crit due to one of the passives i took, and socketed discharge in mjolnir
things go kafrickinboom
it is glorious
granted, my single target damage is nonexistent
but still
lol
the masses flee
no, the masses disappear in a pillar of explosions :D
with a crater in the ground
lol
nice
i didn't know you had a moon base, deco
that was supposed to be a good movie
space nazis
#1
No one is supposed to know
#2
how did you all find pix?
#3
no one will believe you
well, i found the picture of your moon base on google
so you might want to make your secret base more secret
A fair plan
see this?
I wanna do that with this stencil:
inspired by m31
that would be cool
lmao @ pop
"pitbull"
lol
ap, i have decided to go for broke with this mjolnir character
because such fun
im going to run righteous fire on top of it
because im right next to all the life regen nodes anyway
god I'm excited
Guten morgen Arztin
NOPE
NOPE NOPE NOPE
Guten Morgen Ärzte.
that's it
Da
today is a war thunder day i think
my guess is the blocks he placed just completed the power connection
huh
oh nvm, it works without those
well then
jfhjashfdjasjfkljalksdf toaster stroodle y u still so cold inside yet so hot outside?!
it's the breakfast of hot pockets
that is the coolest build ship
how do people get those kind of angles?
that's cool
rotors + connectors
it's held by the magnetic lock of the connectors
gotcha
m31 did you see what you inspired me to do?
guten tag
hi
Hi everyone
Hey In
Ian*
greetings
How goes everyone?
I just had a good lunch
not too bad
What has everyone been up to?
Lately not much, just enjoying the weekend
You?
About the same
just trying to relax
Ah. Yesterday I wasn't sure if it was Friday or Saturday
It was Saturday for sure
I wasn't at work
xD
so this just came up while discussing stuff at the office: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year__problem
it's like Y2k only it's real!
Better make everything 128-bit by then!
or 256
Lets hope for 256
128 would probably last long enough
it'll be interesting to see what software breaks when that happens though
So quiet
lol
technically, we could witness that right now
just set your computer's time to january 18, 
true
that wont break web stuff though
indeed
or at least not most web stuff
I'm storing time like that in my android app's database
although i represent it as a long so it's just sqlite that will break
good advice
this nearly made me lol while in a bathroom stall next to two random people today
all of the kung pow quotes in the comments are awesome
XD
the tears from laughing https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnKR1vcxyK0
so good
lol
phew, first time legit drunk near my computer and password entry has never been so difficult on a locked computer. lol
bedtime
:F
lol
oh my god
that is ridiculous
that moment when you make a change to your code, it breaks, then you roll back and make the same exact change again, and it works
I have no clue why it works now but I'll take it
magic vs. more magic
sounds like a personal problem
have I ever mentioned I hate java error messages?
They make C++ error messages look amazing
lol
I dont' even know D:
i reverted another change and now the old thing that used to work is no longer working
<_>
or when you derp up one nested paren and you get 5 error messages pointing to a different line
fun stuff
lol
Android Studio makes parentheses pretty easy to track
so do most text editors lol
man wtf with this null pointer exception
i'm guessing you have a pointer that you're trying to use, but its value is null when you try to use it
just my guess though
well, java doesn't have pointers that you can use as a programmer
well then
lol
lol
it's a variable that is failing to get anything set to it, but it shouldn't fail
sounds like something weird with a function
it's data getting passed between two different contexts
i put it in, then when it gets to its destination it is gone
woo fixed
hoo rah
So I just got home from work,
And my brother was outside mowing the lawn, so I get a nice tall glass of lemonade and sat on the rocker on the porch.
He saw me and I said:
"Boy, ya'll bedda be doin' a good job now, ya here?"
and his reply was:
"Yeas boss"
lol
lol
awesome family
why nav and logo don't display inline
what do
display: inline;
it not work
display: inline !important;
sudo make me a sandwich
bah
lol
hmmm 30 minutes till i leave, too much time to just sit around, too little time to make meaningful progress on this
nnnnope
is this html/css/whatever visible online?
wait nevermind
got it
derp
what was it?
had to find the right element to make important
lol
had ul block display
but nav inline
lol
well, my app collects data, removes old unimportant data, and displays dummy data on a graph
just gotta make it display the real data instead
neat
what the hell
why would anyone pay that much?
lol maybe people had
I don't think I've ever had so much grief with building a header
lol a bunch of us here have the same notification ringtone
so whenever one goes off we all check our stuff
lol
and sometimes we all get a group email and they all go off within a few seconds
what is it?
just the google notification sound
ahah
make it all penguins or something
so the office quacks when someone gets a mail
wow
well
That was unexpected
lol
suddenly: Jaeger
is she smiling?
I can't tell if she's smiling.
I think she *wants* to smiling.
but can't smiling.
i think the cheeks just make it look like that, but she isnt
lol
the eyes kinda say smiling, the mouth says go away
lol
actual graphed data :D
still need to make it show time for the domain along the bottom, but it is almost working!
cant view that because permission derp
oh hmmmm
google says so :P
it's on google drive, never tried sharing screenshots with it before
try that
yep, that worked
spiffy
ok skyrim bugs are fine every now and then but during storytime it gets annoying
"We'll see soon enough. Alduin approaches!" *10 minutes later*
*still nothing*
did you install those bug fix mods?
At that point you should load a save
i did not
are they only one nexus?
tesnexus usually the place to go
whew that was close
mom says ticket comps were from "gloria"
so I go to the gloria I'm thinking of and begin writing a heartfelt letter
which is Brandon's grandma
(heartfelt letter = Facebook message)
then I pause because mom said "gloria" is friends with Penn and Teller
wrong gloria lol
lol
I know, not the most exciting story but whew
this zoomable plot code is horrible
soooo unreadable
I don't even know wha tI'm looking at
lol
that's the java class in a library that lets me make a graph of data with pinch zoom/pan
but the code is terribly bad and unable to do something I want it to do
is that the only code for that available?
there are probably other android graphing libraries
but this library is otherwise good
I may just rewrite that class so that it doesn't suck
Debating returning to PoE
You mean war thunder?
naaaah
POE
FOR DAYYYYS
lol
I just remember that I never actually beat it because everyone beasted ahead of me lol
however in the midst of playing terraria and league atm
lol
i'll be more than happy to level a char with you
i have a new build i want to run
D:
I still need to beat the damn thing to get the mid thing
maybe
although league intrigues me more lol
Paging Mr. . Mr . Please answer if you are here.
He's always dead
has anyone else seen the "Turn down for what" boat video
wat
where the guy's driving a speedboat and he eats it and his glasses bounce around the boat
no
you can see the fear in their eyes
well
in their expressions
10/10 would not let that guy drive my speed boat
lol
lol I've seen the gif
He looks like he's trying to be so cool
*Must...not...swing arms...or show fear...*
What gets me is the ladies glasses are gone instantly but the dude's glasses manage to stay in the boat.
Oh wait that's rear-guy's glasses.
they are totally on an exit trajectory and then they just fly straight back in too
You can see what I think is the mother's fear before the first few jumps.
... i'm not sure how to start a text message with someone on my new phone
i only know how to reply
lol
lightning
or message people who already messaged me
dat thunder
crack
i must say the phone/message apps on the nexus 5 are remarkably bad in my opinion
Brandon
That is the creepiest text
I have ever
received
ever
good
just so you know
Its now copy paste material though
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) < (Isn't that great Brandon?)
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) < (Why yes, Ian. It is great!)
why can't I just select a contact and send them a text?! Or just type their number in?! Why is this so difficult?!
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)<(There is no need to be upset.)
^ 10/10 comment
that comment is 3 good 5 me
well i think I managed to send andrew a text
lol
also
have you tried turning it on and off again
ok what is the term for preps now?
#BasicBitch or whatever?
I think my sister is that lol
Love her to death but oooooooooyyyyyyyyyy
She gets so offended at nothing
nevermind
lol
justified
I'm just confused
Stalin Hitler 666?
lol naaaah
so, I ate Schnitzel for the first time today
it was quite good
It is
Did you have spaetzil too?
no, I wasn't sure if I'd like it or not lol
Spaetzil is great
I make it at home
Its basically super delishious
i tried a bit of Spezi someone else got
Where did you go
Cafe Berlin
Where is that?
we have a german guy visiting our office
uhhh
Oh its by ricardos
kinda
kinda
I really really really really like spaetzle
spezi is the coke version of this drink, but there's a pepsi version
and it has a funny name
and I'm trying to find that funny name
Gulasch and Spaetzle is one of my favourite dishes
Schwip Schwap!
someone mentioned it and the German guy instantly said "OOH SCHWIP SCHWAP?! DO ZEY HAVE DAT HERE?!"
he got sooo excited
Hahahaha
lol wow
what is that?
more schnitzel?
OH MAN
THEY HAVE CURRYWURST THERE
-_-
I AM GOING NOW
lol
lol new Ricardo's?
how was the service there?
Just the wurst I imagine.
scurries back to FarCry3
oh god
wow
lol
Gulasch und Spaetzle that I made
did no one look at mine picture? :(
it looked delicious :3
nomnomnom
All homemade the hard way
mein spaetzle is not so pretty because I don't have a spaetzle maker
no, schwip schwap isn't schnitzel, it's a soft drink
it's like orange coke
is it Fanta
no
it's usually made with Fanta though
hm
I just know that Fanta is Germany's attempt at Coke after the formula embargo during the war.
soooooo
Schwip Schwap is something like 5 parts cola to 1 part orange fanta
curious....
oh my god these people are sketch as fuck
I gave the guys I've been working with/for this past month a call. The ads guys.
"Hey this is Anthony."
"Who?"
"An-tho-ny?"
"...Who?!"
"Anthony Humphreys the designer you've been working with."
"OH hey yeah."
"Do we have any feedback on the ad? I haven't heard any approval, disapproval, anything..." (Contract is up in about 12 hours).
"Let me get back to you."
End of conversation.
SKEEEEEEEEEEEEETCH
wait well
maybe it's not sketch
quick Brandon what's your partner's name
that seemed pretty sketch
lol
philip
davis
are they actually paying you? because if they are then its much less sketch
but if they havent payed you yet then very very sketch
woo my battery graph is almost 100% done :D
nice
I just need to make sure it looks nice on all types of screens and figure out why it prematurely collapses old data
lol they haven't paid me myet
you should probably make them pay up front or at least pay partially
or have a legally binding contract
or know where they sleep at night
that too
I have a legally binding contract.
And I know their uber-boss, who probably knows where they sleep at night.
But yeah contract always
aaaaaaalways
motherfucker
ok so in FarCry3 you can craft things from animal hides, but only CERTAIN animal hides
i needed a goat
foudn a goat
somehow managed to shoot him right off a cliff
better start climbing down
nope
ok tried climbing
fell to death
hate goat
maybe he saw it coming so he goat out of there
. . .
bravo
lol
more developing
found 3 goats
managed to take out 2 in one shot and kill the other
whilst harvesting goats
get attacked and killed by tiger
hahaha
This game does not want me to have goats.
YES! I got zooming and panning working correctly!!!!! :DDDD
now I just need to figure out why math is broken!
or maybe time is broken
WAHOO
I could go for a nice refreshing schwip schwap right now
I'd still ike to know what that is
5 parts coke to 1 part orange fanta and it's apparently the best thing ever
must try
I honestly only want it so I can offer schwip schwap to people
and be like "yeah, i'm not doin much.. just drinking a cup of schwip schwap"
"schwip schwap?" "yeah, it's like spetzi"
lol
ok derp
I thought shooting a caged animal would shoot the animal
not the cage
this frees the animal
bears aren't nice
hahaha
i didn't get hurt
but i did free him after i cleared the outpost
you gave him his freedom and how does he repay you?!
which means my buddies arrived
the bear mauled my buddies
he chases me and mauled my buddies :<
poor payment
i just imagine you to be a comically bad poacher
I'm running terraria on my tablet to drain my battery so I can test this app. lol
lol
also i beleive that
My bad poacher name should be Barely Grills
oh wow
block control via cockpit
yeah
it should be pretty great
i think we can have fighting robots now
we can have a lot of things now
people on reddit are talking about programming macros to controls robots and printers and stuff
lol wow
have an auto welder build a giant block of armor, then use an auto driller (using a thruster as the drill bit) cut out the hull shape
alternating between the welder and cutter and placing the block frames manually
cut out hull shape?
yeah like a 3d printer kinda
make a flat plane of armor then cut out any of the open space
oh my god space police lol
OH SNAP
wow ok
actually what I just described was possible before
so
well not exactly but the end result was
well not exactly but close enough
lol
tl;dr: I only looked at the pictures on reddit so I am missing details
oh my god tailgunners can be a thing
lol someone said you can make like a swiss army ship
flip out grinder
flip out welder
flip out drill
yeah now that you can toggle them without opening the terminal they will be a lot better
See when programming blocks are out that's when I think I'll fall behind :<
Depends on how they implement it
I very much expect them to have a drag/drop mode
Even then, it'll probably be simple
events you can hook in to, a few calls to do stuff
like getObjectByName("button1").onToggle(doTheThing());
and doTheThing() { getObjectByName("rotor1").reverse(); }
then bam, that button now reverses a rotor
you probadbly won't be doing stuff like programming sorting algorithms or web APIs or complex data structures, etc.
whoa you can group things to a toggle
OY
just hooking up events and actions
so much potential
yeah
I don't have inspiration to make a cool ship right now though
lol
yeah....
after my dinghy got ripped to shreds
lol
we can make transformers now...
we can make QWOP
lol god
sooo question
If a website isn't responsive, would that stop you from publishing it?
responsive as in to viewport size?
yeah
you should try to make it responsive just as a general rule of modern web design
I'm so tired of my old site
but it's responsive
my new design is not
but it has more stuff
so if it's responsive, but dated vs. not-fully responsive but updated, what would you do?
which one do you like more?
non-responsive updated
then use it
alright
soooooooooooooooo
philip
he put up a pull request with the code for screen usage tracking
I thought he tested it
he didn't
he made sure it compiled but not that it actually ran on the phone
<_>
derp lol
it had a bunch of useless code, non-functional code, and a straight up syntax error in the sql create query
poor form Partner Dude, poor form
lol
he named one of the database columns a reserved SQL keyword
so it was throwing errors when making the table
(but not visible errors)
((so it took forever to track down))
oooh
it'd be cool to play and limit yourself to no connector/ejector/collector blocks
so you actually have to have a cargo system like that
lol that's nuts
Andrew
when are you in Vegas?
Also I have taken to robocraft
10/10
no
11/10
it's like that time you sold trash and became rich
Its exactly like that
I
should do that
in real life
i may or may not come to vegas now
alex just had an interview
where at?
and if she gets the job then that limits our ability
forever 21
5evur 14
more accurate
I got a book in the mail today
From Amazon
I ordered it "new"
I got an ebook from amazon
Its printing date is 1966
My "new" book was printed in 1966
however
it was in perfect conditioned and delivered faster than I could turn on my tablet
the book is clearly un used
and is actually new
so I have a new book, from 1966
fun
oh my god I'm so fucking out of my element...
?
designer i met last night
blows me out of the water hardcore
I just breathe "freshman" I know it
I mean I know I have a long way to go but ooooh my goooood
level 12 is hard
nvm got it
lol
lol 12 was easy for jme
Seriously though I hate those little reality-checks where my talent seems insignificant. Like holy hell.
objectivity is weird
So my coworker is reassembling a printer. The conversation just went like this "So it must have been pretty broken right?" "It had a paper jam" (The printer is completely disassembled down to the circuit boards)
lol awww
they changed the artist thumbnails on google music. It took me a while to realize why I couldn't find any of my artists >_<
this kinda disturbs me that people would think about selling this
really? that seems pretty expectable to me
lol Andrew how many sushi places have you been to?
lots
sushi is very different
lol
sushi is a secluded environment
You've never seen like "Sex on the Beach" or "Screaming orgasm" or "My girlfriend is hairy" ?
this is talking about a roving truck
lol
(Alternatively, "Your girlfriend is hairy")
kids could walk up like "ooh ice cream" and be like "mommy whats a quick fuck?"
lol
lol
shame they don't have Chocolate Wasted
we have (or at least had) trucks that drive around with pole dancers in a cage in the back, in vegas
so
it's pretty normal for here
lol
god that would be a terrible car accident
lol
lol ok apparently Spencer is a done with me as I am with him
no response for a week
so on a whim I send him an invoice with Paypal
paid not an hour after I get a sent confirmation
lol
lol
WOO screen on/off logging on my app works now :D
and you can refresh graphs without leaving/reloading the page
correction: you can refresh the battery graph and you can crash the screen graph
lol
lol anyone else see Assassin's Creed Unity tags?
Walking Simulator
Pixel Graphics
Don't Preorder
Uplay Warning
remember watchdogs
So
Andrew
you in town this weekend
?
Also everyone already here: Ricardos?
I'm so down.
I mean
who can refuse great mexican food?
Ricardos sounds good to me
I'm unavailable on the 8th but otherwise good
anyone want to join on some The Ship in like 30 minutes?
yeah I'm down
oquay anyone else?
(i still have a giftable copy)
alex got the job today so unless she doesnt start training for a while i'm probably not coming
WOO at the job
we'll just hire a stand-in for you
And-new
maybe we'll eat with Poncho in your place
a person named Poncho or the clothing article
por que no los dos?
Poncho in a poncho.
Bueno.
Divinity Original Sin looks like an interesting RPG
Thal says its good
the guy who sits beside me at work is in love with it
lol you should get it and give me an in depth opinion
I've started playing robocraft
its pretty
fun
I've heard my coworker give his super incredibly more indepth than anyone asked for or cares about opinion on it a few times
alex's dad has been trying to get me to play divinity for weeks
he even offered to buy me a copy
lol
but i dont want
:F
it looks good, but i have dark souls and like 100000 other games first
but isnt the point of games only to make your library look full?
nobody actually plays games anymore
^
only works
buying the game is the game
so, I washed my keyboard
the keys feel stiff now
did either of you have that happen, deco/mez?
no
did you let it dry over night?
hmm
yeah
no?
Mine seem fine
and I used soap
like a bad man
these keys are definitely more resistant now
did you dry it keys-up or keys-down?
I have this exact same keyboard at work and this one feels totally different now
keys down and flipped it after a few hours
may have been it
I dry keys-up
dirt could have trickled into the keys
are you supposed to dry it a certain way?
and dried
I just have it keys-up because of the vents on teh bottom
rewash and dry keys-up ?
keys down makes more sense by that logic
how so?
keys up dirt would trickle away from the keys
the rubber switches would be up, and dirt/water would drain away from them
keys up allows it to sit on the rubber dimple and dry
that was my logic for drying it face down at least
I don't know how the key switches are positioned
little rubber dimples recessed below the keys
the keys have a little rod that pushes the dimple when you push the key down
and I assume some sort of water proofing mechanism
I just wouldn't risk keys-down because I'd be worried they would jam.
it's mostly the c key
that's the only one that ever resists enough to not register
welp, The Ship sets sail in 3 minutes
I'm gonna hop on mumble and launch it
join us mezzz
i WOULD, but i dont have a copy :F
lol
want one?
is it fun?
yes
yeah
suer
bursts of fun
wtf
just what you needed?
lololololol
anyways
What the hell
That looks like exactly what google's spam filter should catch
that was the spam folder
lol
they really wanted you to get that message nao
lol
So as I biking down the road someone tried to cut me off. Had to bite my lip because a thought had entered my mind. "Shol'va you will suffer for this imputence!"
lol
up to season 4 so far
lol Chaos Heroes Online
one of these things is not like the other...
lol
Jeeze I wish contact forms were easier.
import contactform;
.js
can't even do it through js
?
contaCT FORMS
-_-
i thought it worked already?
?? nope
it sent emails and stuff though
what was it's issue...OH spam protection that's right
one sec
actually debating skipping spam pro
that'd be a bad idea
wouldn't google filter it?
maybe, maybe not
spamming email from your domain is bad
though anything short of an actual captcha won't really prevent spam
if someone were to send tons of emails via the contact form, it could get your send email ability revoked
oh great
maybe I'll just put my email up...
lol
shame mailto: thing doesn't work really
jeeze that took some time
thoughts?
BAH WHY U NO PRELOAD
yeah, stuff isn't positioned correctly until the window gets resized
...how do you initialize that
two options come to mind
nvm one of those options wont work
so
with javascript you can do something when the page fully loads
whatever you're using for that grid may have a function you can call to make it arrange itself when the page is fully loaded
try again? :D
someone who hasn't yet? :D
scybreak.com/new
derp
still seems to be doing it
wait what
dammit
"Uncaught ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined "
OH holdup
how about now?
same
gr
round 3
that appears to have worked
YAAAAy
yep
looks good
buuut i hit refresh and it broke
^
POR QUEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
what in the hell
how does that
what
WHY DOES THIS REFRESH HORRIBLY
WHY
refreshing breaks
clicking "enter" in the url doesn't
it's weird how the first 1% of battery life takes forever to drain
huh
and after that it drops like a rock
phone has been sitting idle all day
you should add tags for when certain apps open or the phone is plugged in (though it probably wouldnt be noticably different)
well you can tell if the phone is plugged in because the battery level goes up
you can't easily detect when other apps open though
couldnt you hook into the task manager?
it has all the open apps running, even in the background
sec, scrambling to do an assignment for this women's study class i forgot about till just now. lol
lol
afk :F
ok
so, you can get a list of running apps, but that isn't actually very useful in relation to mapping battery life
apps don't do anything unless they are in the foreground actively being used
so, no battery drain
services are more relevant to battery drain
but services usually launch on device startup and never shut down
so, not worth storing the additional data to display that in relation to battery status
gotcha
makes sense
kinda cool what you learn doing a project like this
lol
lol
I have 1 week left to finish quite a bit of stuff on it
gotta add another metric to track, add share button, add delete data after <time> setting, and then spend any additional time testing for bugs and adding small features like next/previous day buttons to graphs
that is a lot
well when you need testing i could probably figure out how to use it on my phone
as long as nothing will destroy everything
that would be bad
lol
lol
anywho
tim = bed
android prevents stuff like that from being possible
that's very nice of them
I had a dream I was a mix between Batman and Cyborg, and Andrew was there too. He was a mix between The Flash and something else
we were really OP
we were fighting against other people from GamerHaus and their leader was Janeway from Voyager
we were kicking their butts so they became sore losers
and then at the end of it I saw a wifi-enabled backpack that queried an online database of skeletal types to find the best strap settings for the best fit on whoever was wearing it
lol
what

yeah, and you posted a pic on reddit and reached the #40 spot on /r/all
you might have even been wolverine considering the super hero theme of my dreams last night
lol
so .js doesn't load on mobile

every modern website uses js
and every modern mobile browser supports js
oh then it's just hte preload issue again
although
:/
hm
lightbox didn't load either
i assume you're viewing it via android or ios yeah?

i haven't seen it yet

i could go earlier
well you see
my mom is also going to see a different movie, a chick flick
and thats the only time the two align apparently
D: oh dear
im gonna go see it on tuesday
it looks amazing
it does...
and got really good reviews
I wanna goooooooo
you could be fashionably late to the party
*spongebob narrator voice* "THREE HOURS LATER"
three is a fashionable number
lol ehhh
but i'm afraid of the numbers above two
r u Gabe
i'm ernest
señor hemingway
I have all of Hemingway's novels
i have read a few of them
all of them were for school
junior year of high school
my honors english teacher was obsessed with hemingway
lol 3 hours late
I read "The Old Man and the Sea" at least once every summer
that is one of the ones i've read
it was alright
Are you a reader?
lol
someone in my 10th grade english class read the old man and the sea
and hated it
i try to read
but i dont read nearly as much as i did in high school
i used to read multiple books per week
now its like one per two months
very slowly
not that it takes me long to read
just that I don't take the time to do it
lol
Are you currently reading something
I am reading game of thrones
ah
Darn, I was hoping it was something more up my ally
I read Freakonomics.
that was strange
i made a ship just now
and it pulled its two arms in, which caused it to spin super fast
and then that caused the arms to get sucked towards the center
so the pistons couldnt push them back out
and it just kinda spiraled out of control
lol
lol
game of thrones is good
well written and stuff
with lots of cool backstory that the show cant give you
I read...
Late 19th century and early 20th century German realist novels
right now that is what I am in to
sounds boring
Its interesting
its all very philosophical
I want fallout 4
lol
ya gotta love fallout
fallout is nice
maybe when he was a wee young lad he had a pet cow, and now that is all that remains of it
coming to watch GotG with ya
woo i'll tell my people
ok
so i think we'll see GotG and my mom/dad will watch the one my mom wanted to see
your dad's a trooper
lol
what's the flick?
no clue
welp that's it
that's the end
i no longer need to leave the house for anything in existence
you've never used dolphin before?
nope
just heard of it
I've been using dolphin 5evur
Do you have a wired xbox controller?
I use that as the gamepad
Its honestly pretty great
I only have the chargeable wireless ones T_T
Buy a wired one, they are cheap
i just had a thought
Wut
Super Smash Bros?
hell yes
but actually
I'm charging my wire-chargeable wireless controller via phone charger
see if that works
i know the computer doesn't output current but chargers do
so we'll see how that goes...
Science*!
*As performed by someone who is not actually a scientist.
computers output current
dem amps
ehhh
not enough to charge + connect a controller apparently
yeah the wire doesn't even have an indicator light that works
so if this fails
maybe i'll hunt craigslist
you can probably connect a wiimote via a bluetooth dongle
you can
lol I read that int eh reviews
you can get a wireless receiver for xbox360 controllers for $20
mine isn't the battery pack controller it's the wire-charge wireless
just buy a wired controller used then
that doesnt matter
if it's a wireless controller then it'll transmit to it
I was just saying that if I'm going to be using a controller I prefer wired.
oh
This one's a last-ditch effort to use something that's free lol
the charge cable doesn't send controller input over usb
if you want to just plug it in to a usb port and use it, it has to be non-wireless
bummer
OHHHH
OH IT GOT A READ
lol nope no controller input
ok wired it is lol
yeah, I've gone through this exact process before lol
gotta be a true wired one if you want wired pc input
i find the wire to be super annoying if you're sitting near the monitor
sitting on a couch or something farther away isn't bad but then the image is far away
lol I just don't want to have to worry about batteries, etc.
well you have a rechargable controller
so you could charge and use a wireless thing and it'd be $10 cheaper than getting a new wired one
not a bad idea
shame it does bluetooth and not wifi
it does radio actually
huh
apparently xbone controllers work on pc
via micro usb
i want maple sausage
you are canadian now?
i've been watching tv shows with a lot of canadian actors
maybe it's rubbing off
lol
so a bluetooth dongle will work with the wireless?
no
I need a radio transmitter.
receiver
lol
eh?
reviews said it works but you have to manually install the drivers on win7 apparently
which is easy enough to do
...are controllers needed?
probably not strictly needed, but it's hard to immitate two joysticks via mouse/keyboard
don't you already have a game cube and wii?
hokay
tony
so
are you hungry?
i have a gc and wii yes
also yeah
okay
so
we'll pick you up then and we'll eat at the food court there
now, imma get ready and stuff
afk
cool ok
heading over
what shall we do?
i dunno
or you can come over
pool
netflix
chess
projectfree tv
work on your app with visual stuff
do nothing and hang out?
Ok, I also have a paper to write but it isn't due at any specific time
so
perhaps we can just find stuff to do
netflix and such and I can also write a bit of that
lol
lol sure
let me pump up my tire and i'll be on the way
k
watch in the AM it's gonna be all muggy and gross
yup
...may revert back to scroll-website
it's just the trend nowadays :<
indeed
there are some good reasons for its popularity too
works very well on mobile
why the hell is background image not working
nevermind
i'm derp
nope
it's derp
I see those vertical screens on the Originate home video
yeah, it seems like portrait monitors would be really handy
i forgot to bring my usb cable D:
I'm sure someone in this office has a micro usb cable
oh shit that's my fault isn't it D:
dammit sorry
nah
I already had the cable out of my backpack before I got it for you
lol
The real problem was, the electricity was out so my house was dark
and I didn't see it
oh
I also forgot my security card lol
yeah mine went out 1am
Mine went out at like 7:30ish
.....
AndroidPlot's documentation site is literally down every other day
that is unfortunate
and would make it really hard to develop something
lol
I'm using a cached version of the page but it loads suuuuuper slow
cached versions usually are
this is one hell of a bug
it just makes the screen go black and no controls respond any more
lol
oooh
it crashes because I am generating a plot that has a range of a few billion points
and it is drawing grid lines for that entire range
every 5 minutes someone's phone starts giving an emergency flood warning here
lol
oh Nao, any news on Originate positions?
the current positions Originate is hiring for: Sr. Engineers (Scala, RoR, Front-End, iOS, Android), Project Managers, VP’s of Design and Engineering, QA Lead/Mgr
>w< right, will try other places
lol
I don't suppose working at Originate you'd know of other companies off the top of your head?
not really
h'okay
I hate how it's 10* hotter in the computer room than elsewhere
lol
wat is filmot
Klearly Glorious Komrade website for the host of piktures
filmot is the actual server for imgur
anytime imgur is down for me
which is a lot
i use filmot
replace any filmot with imgur and it's the same
it points to the same exact content though, so if imgur is actually down then so will be filmot
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
if it's "actually" down, most likely
but usually I get a redirect to some shopify front
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) <(Hello Ian)
if that's the case: filmot
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) <(Hello, Brandon, we must Ricardos one last time before your departure)
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) <(Yes Ian, I agree)
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) <(I am sure Anthony would join us)
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) <(Join us Anthony)
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) <(What is the date of your departure?)
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) <(Saturday the 16th)
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) <(We had best go this weekend then)
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) <(We're doing Amnesia night Saturday evening. Perhaps Saturday afternoon or Sunday?)
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) <(We could go after work Friday)
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) <(Possibly. I have a test to take at 4 that day, but it shouldn't take that long)
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) <(Not sure if I can take the test at work or if I'll have to come home to do it)
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) <(I have no problem with a late dinner, if either of you do)
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) <(What does Anthony think?)
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) <(Yes Anthony, please opine)
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) <(Oh right, I forgot he doesn't communicate with telepathy)
Hey Tony, thoughts on Ricardos?
?
what he said
4.5 out of 6 pages written
I'm definitely down
let me know a definite day
Friday maybe
Maybe lunch saturday
something like that
I'd like Friday if Brandon is up for it after his test
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) <(Brandon, are you up for it?)
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) <(I think I can make it work)
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) <(Very well then)
So Friday then
7:00 or 8:00 ish?
Assuming I take my test at work, I could make 5:45-6:00
7:00 is cooler tempeture wise
lol
But I'm fine with whenever
uhhhh
was there an alternative day or is Friday it?
Saturday
lol Friday it is then
woo paper is done
I hope whoever in the CSE department reads it is capable of taking criticism
lol
so I tried to look at my Womens Studies study guide
I dont think I made it 10 words before thinking "this is BS" and stopping to watch netflix instead
Unturned looks fun
ugh wedding in Aruba...plz send ticket

I imagine Aruba smells like licorice

weirdly specivid
I imagine clean salt
I would assume it simply smells like the sea
^clean salt
The sea doesn't smell like clean salt to me
lol

( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
yeah
lol hm
weird
Well in the text field it's spread out
until I type next to it
it physically scrunches up
welp, I am about 1/3 done refactoring all of this database code
the good news is, it works
the bad news is, I still have 2/3 to go
so I found this song https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9cP3OqK6Y8 and really liked it. I looked up the band, and it is the only song they made
and they have been totally inactive for two years
D:
Nice little collab
... does the video look photoshopped to you?
it looks edited
they look airbrushed lol
well they probably all had makeup done for the shoot
now listening to amaranthe
amaranthe is pretty good
there's a highly noticable blur (to me)
their edges look off
also oof
i assumed oof just meant out of focus
i'm guessing the DOF is edited in
and makes the rest looks blurry too
lol
out of focus works
wow
I just made like a 500-600 line change to this, ran it, and it just worked
lol awesome
yeah, unfortunately I just finished what I gave PD to work on yesterday
so now he really won't have contributed anything
lol
but he took to long and failed to respond to me on chat
group projects ver. 2
248 lines added, 372 lines removed
sounds like a good refactor to me
oh
wow
Amaranthe is going to play the WT show too
the one we're going to
lol oh nice
lol licorice? I'd imagine it'd be more like pineapple and coconuts
lol
so tony
myes nao
if you feel like making an icon this is the style guide
You just need the launcher icon, yes?
launcher and google play icons
which will both be the same just GP is 512x512
did you have an idea of what you wanted it to look like?
Something simple
that shows a graph
I've stuck pretty close to Google's design standards
so maybe look at some google app launcher icons
i hate this dp thing
lol
Launcher icons actually say to be 512px
?
under the gmail launcher example
for Google play
It should be multiples of 48x48 pixels
but I'm wondering if I scale up or down for MDPI, HDPI, etc.
512 isnt a multiple of 48
so
I think what you should do is:
but you see where it says that, yes?
no, where is it?
3rd row of pictures on the page you linked me to
under Launcher Icons
there's a cluster of colored Gmail icons on the left
below that
oh
that's a special case
@_@
ok so
2 versions lol
on Google Play (the app store's picture) it is 512
that's easy
app store doesn't care about dp
that's where I was getting confused
but yeah, we need to support up to XXXHDPI
which would be....
192x192 px
o.o that's 640dp?
no clue
lol
thats what my math said
but
lol
my math has been wrong before
is dp relative to the device?
dp is based on the device's screen
dp provides a consistent look regardless of device
I'm just trying to figure out an easy way to calculate this
yeah i am pretty sure 192x192 is XXXHDPI
so if you make an icon at that size we can scale it down to all of the lower DPI icons
righto..... how do people arrive at that number though? is the conversion different per device?
nah
look at the set of pencil icons on that page
1 DP is 1 PX at 160 DPI
so at MDPI (160 DPI) 1 dp = 1 px
at 320 DPI, 1 DP = 2 PX
OOOOh
oy
so weird
lol
well not weird but man
it's useful
they don't really ease you into that
lol
it makes more sense once you juyst wing it and everything fails
lol fair enough
the 'ol aperture method
then your like "ohhhh... that's what they meant... stars ABOVE..."
er i mean
lolwhat?
you know, chosimbaone
oh lol
i get it
lol
>_>
<_<
>_<
<_>
^_^
v_v
the cycle is complete
not yet
^_v
v_^
<_^
oh god
lol
no i'm done
lol
hahaha
so, I made a bunch of the changes we discussed before the movie the other day
I think the settings actually make sense now
awesome :3
lol ok i have an idea now
and I'm expecting you to at least smirk at the familiarity
let me whip it up real quack
whip it good
ok wait
72dpi?
density?
?
or should it be 300?
192x192 pixels at 640 DPI
see this is why it threw me I realize
ok web usually says "72 dpi end of story"
one sec
yeah illustrator maxes at 300
one sec
lol
does it matter? isnt 192x192 like... it?
it's just a 2d grid of pixels
lol
dpi is dots per inch
300 is for print 72 is for web 150 is for newspapers
yeah but i dont see why that matters for this?
so dp bing pixel density...
i dont think it matters
just do whatever dpi
I'm just wondering if I need to set it for higher than 300 or if 192 at 72dpi is still XXXDP
should still be
ok science time
I'm gonna do it at 512 first so it's easer to scale donw to 192
I really should have kept all of my old android devices
That would have been really useful for testing the app on old screens/android versions
lol
ooh
beautiful
also, do you get what I was laughing at?
lol yeah
Can you send it to me in the various sizes zipped up together?
yup
i dont have access to photoshop here
oh also i don't have a rar program so when you zip it just do .zip or something
lolk
woo thanks!
Now, I have no clue how to actually import these to my app so I'll figure that out
lol
it's so colorful
I should add color to the app
totally didn't realize you were sending those in a 1-1 chat lol. Silly linux skype
lol
still, glad you liek it
huh...ok so how to showcase this
?
I want to show in my gallery that I made the icon, but I don't want people to think I made the app
lol
why is it so freaking hard to change the action bar's color
so i wanted to change the action bar color to red, just as a test...
it changed EVERYTHING except the action bar
kek
shiny
lol
I sent that last image to the guy in charge of the intern EIR projects, he said it looks great :D
sweeeeeeeeeeeeeeet
EIR?
what do you think would be a better color for the action bar? I want to change it away from the default black just so it feels more finished
entrepreneur in residence
noice
actually black and green is a nice tech color (think the matrix)
if you want to add some color you can add icons to your lists
that may be a good idea
icons!
all in black because I hate Gimp
lol
was there a reason you didn't use the ones from the resource list?
or are these?
?
you made all of these in gimp?
no
i just didn't want to use gimp to recolor
oh lol
they from here?
yeah
nifteh
I'M USEFUL!
Can I post about that app Brandon?
or is it "Originate" property?
you can
it is my property
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ... {Mmmmm Ricardos}
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ... {I am so hungry}
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) <(I already had dinner, I had muslim food)
wat
i just got a text from some random number
it's a picture of a guy with rabbit ears edited on to his head
oooooooooooo
k
tony
i just got ganked in pvp by a guy that was named solid snake, he used chameleon which is a spell that turns you into a piece of furnature, then he came up, stabbed me in the back (which killed me) and ran and hid behind a wall
woo thank you
tony
ttttoooonnnnyyyy
returrrrrrrn the slaaaaaab
nah curse plz
hi
so
for amnesia night
we can do it at my place
o.o oh?
my parents said they dont care
lol
._. awful generous
ok lol
we should still try to be quiet for their sake, but they said it's fine if we make noise
lol ok
so for the next month im going to be working at a temp job with my uncle :)
nice!
what kind of job?
Shiny. A job you enjoy?
$15 an hour and overtime every day? yesplz
mostly paperwork
but idc, better than the theater
lol
lol
yeah
awesome
especially since i need $1000 ish to fix my car
just go find a car on the side of the street
people leave them sitting there all the time
thats how I got mine
gonna buy an engine from japan
they have to change theirs after 50k miles anyway
i want a Scion FR-S
and my engine has 300k
my tablet's battery is so good that it is making it hard to test my app :(
i can leave it sitting there with the screen on for like an hour straight and it wont drop below 100%
damn what car?
?
has 300k miles on it
that car has driven to the moon and 1/5 of the way back
lol
an accord
because hondas are awesome like that
and to be precise, it has 00 miles on it :P
so almost the 300k mark
lol
Hondas last a long time
sadly, my head gasket cracked, and instead of paying a few hunderd to fix that on an old engine, my dad and i decided it was probably better to just get a whole new engine
ooooh
you could just use duct tape
so my gas milage dropped from around 30 to around 20 :(
EEEeeeeeeeee :[]
don't you hate when code has a bug that only occurs when you aren't monitoring it and is otherwise totally unreproducable?
but my milage would be better if i didn't live in a shittty state LIKE CALIFORNIA.... where they put crap in our gass to drop gas milage and lower emissions
like my mom's car gets around 22 mpg, but when we got gas in oregon it went up to 35
no lie
lol yeah nao
o.o holy hell
That's....saddening...
at least cali has a lot of tesla charging stations
meh
>Implying I have a Tesla
no one drives those though
Theres a lot of them near my work
i think i've seen 4
I see one like every day
(I work down the street from the dealership)
lol
my neighbor across the street has one
Lol I saw a few when I went to Holsum
they're really not a bad looking car
they are just super cool
those door handles
super expensive
but it'll pay for itself!!!
eventually
in like
a lifetime
but still!
exactly
they are more computer than car!
ill take my itty bitty car any day :)
they're apparently making a tesla motorcycle
besides, i got it for cheap from family
Saw that. I think Harley's making it.
yeah
o.O
but
no harley sound
lol
lol
yeah that'd be strage... a silent motorcycle
That's the gripe a lot of people ahve actually.
you'll never hear it coming
just stick a loud speaker with it on loop
lol
or tape a card to the spokes
you know its a harley when you can her the friggin thing from a mile away
LOOOL
omg
haha
i can just imagine that
I could totally see a tesla cycle rolling down the street with a card held by a clothes pin on the spokes
PBPBPBPBPBPBPBPPBBBPBPBPBPBPB
lol
lol
tony
we need to do that room escape thing
lol when?
You're practically out of town.
I'll be leaving next saturday
I can take tuesday, wednesday, or thursday off
sunday this weekend i am also free
lol ok
here
already there
lol
hahah
have a room preference?
and did you want to invite anyone else?
we can have up to 10 people
well if we have 4+ people someone can get $20 off
so we should probably do 4+ if we can
any room is fine with me
I know someone who may be interested
well
I know 2 other
maaaaaaaaaaaaaybe Mai
I'd say we could ask my brother but he has the craziest most unpredictable schedule I've ever seen
lol
well
my friends wanted me to join them
but at the same time they didn't want it to be solved TOO fast
This is interestin
yeah
lol
I don't think it'll be solved too fast
it's hard to say how quickly we'll be able to solve it
yeah
I know literally *nothing* about these rooms.
same
i like to think we're pretty smart people
so
i assume we'll be able to figure it out lol but who knows
ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
"If you would like to make a team with your friends and do not want other players to join you, please purchase all the tickets of a certain session time, which is 10 tickets. If you cannot purchase all 10 tickets, it means someone has already purchased 1 or more tickets at that time slot."
I guess regardless they have 10 people
oh
if people buy tickets for it
yeah
although it's apparent that they're not always 10/10
yeah
hmmmmmmmmmmm
so my app is ready to publish to Google Play
but first I need to test it on screens other than Nexus5/7
gl/hf
hgl
send it to me
mine is weird
lol
hgl = have good lunch
I'm not sure how to send it, but I know it is possible to send via email somehow
^
hglym
lol
still miss that guy
i had an italian soda from a Villa here
it wasn't as good
there was no love in it
is sir ian back from (assuming) work yet?
lol the Syrian
well i will play dark souls until sir ian can play war thunder
man, it's lovely not having a job'
too bad the money is horrible :F
lol
guys, if I ever forget the password remind me that the password is "GraphitPassword"
k
What's the Graphit Password? >_>
<_<
wait is it Graphit or GraphIt
GraphitPassword
GraphIt
but
oklol
the password isnt
the password is GraphitPassword
i sent it to you andrew
before you do anything check the install from unknown sources option in your settings
then open the email with gmail on your phone and it should display an install button
alrighty, installed and running all three modules
it didn't crash? :D
hasnt generated a graph for any yet, and nope
wooo
lol
battery graph may take a while depending on your battery status
its charging from about 30%
screen will require the screen to be on and off to get 2 data points first
so it shouldnt take too long i'd guess
network should show up soon
if you turn the screen off for 1-2 minutes then all 3 should work i'd imagine
screen is off currently
excited to see results
the interface is really neat
the only thing I think may possible display incorrectly is the graph formatting
since it doesn't default to DP, it uses PX
ah
we'll see
I think I overwrote everything important to use DP but i may have missed something
i'll take some screenies of the graphs and send them your way to confirm
ok :D
had to zoom in super far to see the points for battery, but that seems normal since it was only 3 points
yeah
some clipping issues on two of the displayed numbers for the points at max zoom
when you pull up the graph it displays the current day midnight to midnight
yeah, those numbers are iffy
this graphing library doesn't let you format them
i may just remove them lol
ah
the color for the screen graph points is absolutely horrid
i can't see it
lol
lol what would be a better color?
anything that isnt super light blue
it was supposed to be yellow but clearly that didn't happen
lol
i've got a screenshot of it
maybe you can find the point :P
i already used green and blue
and red is harsh
orange might be a good middle ground
yeah
also network usage hasnt popped a graph yet
but i'm on wifi
wifi would show up
aha
try googling something
well
yeah
was gonna say that lol
changed to orange
much easier to see now
o
there's a bug i forgot about
tiny bug
the default values for some options dont work
so you should go through the settings and set them
i think it's just the number of days before collapsing setting
that's weird
the zoomed out battery pic
yeah
i think its because i zoomed out like a few months and it's a constantly rising graph
yeah
i just tried on mine that has more data
it gradually fades out
default data compression delay should be fixed now too
nice
i like it
now you just need to add a free version and add ads to it, and you're a real android developer!
lol
I'm just going to release this as is for free without ads
I plan on making another app after this of some sort that may have a paid version
lol
you should add the ability to view these graphs laid on top of each other
to see the correlation between network usage and battery, etc without having to switch between modules
^^^^
like
like like ilike that
how would a user go about selecting two or more graphs to view layered together?
you could have a " something" button
then the on/off switches turn into select/deselect switches
or checkboxes
the on/off switches are important though
ok so make a button you click
highlight the ones you want
keep in the dark the ones you don't want
I think it would only make sense to display at most two graphs at once
also have a "select all" or "unselect all"
since you need to see range values on the side for it to make any sense
so, graph 1 range on the left graph 2 range on the right
you can have different colors/shades represent that... I think
no
because
network usage is measured in gb
battery is in percentage
two two are different units
you need to be able to see that
network usage doesn't always start from 0 too
so
not possible to offse tthe bars?
a small change can look the same as a big change without having a scale there
(also network display changed since you last saw it)
Not in a very readable manner
hrm
screen space is limited
Also a human won't really be able to make sense of three complex data sets all on top of each other
* data sets with different scales and units
lol you should graph the amount of time people spend using the app
i added colorization to the icons on the main page
color matches the graph color
So I think the most intuitive way to view two graphs together is to add a new page specifically for that
it would have an option that brings up a list of all possible graphs
and you can choose them that way
so like click the graph 1 list and choose something
then click the graph 2 list and choose another
binary/qualitative/etc?
just don't name them that lol
?
there would be two selection lists at the top of the activity
I imagine those are the lists you can do...
ooooh ok
both lists would contain "battery" "screen" and "network"
I was thinking "overlay" menu and "choose 2"
nope
to maximize screen space the two lists could actually be in the action tray
(the kind that pops out from the left side of the screen. not currently used in my app)
I am here
wat
woah
when did it become so late
lol
Andrew asked if I was
here
I am now
no you are just a figment
am I?
yes
Oh
well
Is Andrew here?
And are we still ony for Ricardos tomorrow?
yup
7:00?
earlier would be nice
like around 5:30
lol
in time for Brando not to drive back
lol
let's think of this now: do we want to do something AFTER?
well I wouldnt drive back and then to and back again
also nao I'd drive you back lol
I'd end up just hanging out here
or that
you forget I'm your neighbor
nah i dint forget
but thats a lot of driving back and forth
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)<(Your very close neighbor.)
i suppose its the same amount of driving
but
lol
lol well
it is more sitting and wiating for me
lol
5:30 is too early for me
i can do whatever
cause I may not be off yet then
so
i'm down for either
you know what
do 7
because then
also Ian remember to come INSIDE the restaurant
i can leave work at like 2
and take my test at home
so yeah
:7
:7> <(Seven)
7:00 it is
and okay
meeting in the lobby I guess
lol
okay well i am going to drive home now
ok
and where did Andrew go?
Dark Souls 2
curse him
lol
He asked for me
and then was like
Okay
I'll go now
lol
apparently i may be able to come to vegas from tuesday to friday
next week
but what does this mean for ricardos!?
lets go when i'm there! WEEEEEE
18k people watching a fish play pokemon
what are we doing with our society?
lets go
TWICE
Also Andrew wat you need of me
lol the fish died
or not?
nope, just asleep
hmm
i installed my app on a Nexus S and the action bar is derp
what does your app do?
records and graphs data about your phone
Oh that sounds cool
<.<
What info does it send to the dev
your social security number
oh
this version of android puts the menu button at the bottom with the other major buttons like home/back/search
I know androids can send tons of info to devs so
....
yeah
that is annoying
my app doesn't have permission to send data
also paranoia
oh even better
Is your app public?
I'm trying to test it on older devices before I publish it
I have an S III still
I've only tested it on API 19 so far
actually I think this Nexus S is API 18
most importantly, however, is testing it on shitty screens
it looks amazing on my beautiful nexus screens but low DPI screens might not work right
I may have a droid 2 sitting around
one sec
Its totally dead
lol
oh, this nexus S is API 16
I don't think this is tracking network data
on the nexus s
yeah doesn't seem to track network stuff on API 16
oh nevermind, it does
So, why isn't there a smartphone version of pokemon where you get pokemon by wandering around and then you can battle people in public places... etc...
^
there probably is
I mean like an official one
because nintendo is too weird to make something that makes sense like that
oh ian i was just saying we should play some war thunder
lol
but i cant now :F
nooooooooooooooooooooo
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
i knowwwwwww
um
lol
is the fish dead
the fish is dead
lol
no
sleeping
the fish is not dead
read the FAQ
it would be funny if it was dead
it would be
lol
if it goes belly up
lol
7pm tomorrow, yes folks?
yes
yes
yes
feel so far away
cause you are
n00b
The Doctors go to Canada sounds like a sitcom
more like Nao goes to Lone Mountain with his co-workers >_<
that was a freaking adventure and a half
o.o
how was that?
also
lol
how was the drive?!
?
lone mountain isnt much of a drive
I'd be ticked if I drove all the way to your work then to lone mountain
nah
from home to lone mountain
this morning
oh jeeze
im at home right now
just showered
that's awesome
so
got to the bench and threw up
lol
o.o
you did?
yeah
tasted like banana too
y u puke
I didn't hydrate at all before going
ahh...
i didnt know about it till yesterday evening
so I drank too much too fast
and then i threw it all up
THEN
that's the beginning of the adventure
then
we decide to go back down
and we get lost
we end up going to the wrong side of the mountain in relation to where our cars are
we decide to keep going instead of backtracking
we find a fence
we jump it
we find another fence
we jump it too (it was bigger this time)
then we look at GPS and realize we're incredibly far from our cars
so we walk
and find another fence with spikes on top!
so we jump that but it was derpy as hell
one guy got stabbed in the ribs by the top of the fence
and i got wedged inbetween the spikes
so we get past tjat
and find ANOTHER FENCE
so two of us are like eff that
two others jump it
and one guy splits off to just jog around to our cars
guy who got hit in the ribs and I just go over some rocks and then find our cars
it was an adventure
I'm just sad I didn't drink green (brown) drink before going. then my puke would have really disturbed them
lol
ok that is a sitcom
what if authorities caught you fence hopping?
well it wasn't for private property
"Don't worry we're programmers."
lol
it was fences around the two parks there
ahah
why'd your work go to lone mountain
no reason
???
we went for the sake of going
lol
so then you're headed to the office later?
you have such a chill workplace man
after i finish this green drink, yeah
gotta give a presentation today
I was planning on being in by 9am or shortly before...
Clearly that didn't happen
the LV Sun was gonna do interviews at originate today
specifically of unlv/unr people
but
oh snap
NOBODY that fits that criteria was there at 9 am
and still isnt there
lol
X_x
whups
they only told us about it yesterday at 6pm, to be fair
seems fun
D: a bit yeah
they added the ability to import skyboxes I think :D
yeah
via steam workshop
people also auto download mods when joining a server
saw that :D
every time i open chrome i instantly click the reddit button even if I had no intention of browsing reddit
>_<
i do that but with youtube
^Facebook
bacefook
T-1hr45m to Ricardos
woo
I have to leave town Monday
my grandpa has atrial fibrillation
I have to take him to a specialist in Salt Lake
oh wow
yup
good luck man that's sketchy
nao, i'm driving you, yes?
or are you departing from work?
im at home now
so yes
oh lol ok
when's a good time to flee?
I"ve been home since like 2:30
lol
uh
OH
._.
well then lol
i came home early to take my women's studies test
anywho
orite
like 6:20 or 6:30 i would guess
is that what we're calling it
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
ok
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) I like the way you think
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) Fightin' against the patriarchical norms of society bro.
I feel bad lol
?
I'm down for equality but I still want to refer to intercourse as women's studies
at least
lol
for the dude's side of hetero and for lesbians
so like 10 minutes in to my test it was like "TIMES UP YOU WANNA SAVE AND LEAVE?"
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Pardon
My manliness cannot hear your sissy statements
then it said I was like 580 hours over the time limit
I was like "uhh... soo.... should i keep working or what?"
noyes
._.
u w0t m8
sware on me mum
i'll blow yer fookin 'ead off m8
on ze way after shoes and socks brandon
look up ricardos location
wait it's on decatur
afk
btw, the MaM upgraded server is up
and has a good TPS
Don't tell me they are building another medival style city
atm, we're just kinda doing whatever
but yes i think we are
ugh
mountaintop castle type thing
They only build in one style
ever
we could use another town to form a nation :P
Zair al-Shadir anyone?
Issue is, we wouldn't be our own state
?
We'd be controlled by medival castle land
no
and Zair would be tough to build without sand gens
indeed
I miss Zair
For those who know: starting a slow-clap is next on my list
time to watch me sum frankie!
Unturned should happen in the future
agreed
I'm sure this man inspired me to spaz in voice
maybe only the first 5 minutes entertained me but I remember watching this thing years ago
the amount of people going on crusades over the Messenger app is mind blowing and so incredibly idiotic
lol
kinda under the radar for me
All of these people start talking about stuff they know absolutely nothing about as if they are experts on the subject
and it is sooo stupid
lol
meanwhile there are bombs being dropped on the other side of the world and these same people couldn't care less - they are too mad about having their FB messaging in a separate app
<_>
i have started a slow clap before
it was cool
but not THAT cool
lol
since it was kinda expected as a captain my sophomore year in football
or was it freshman
probably freshman, i was better then
lol
lol ok you win
so when wednesday/thursday are we going to ricardos!? :D
"I started a slow clap. It was ok. I mean, as CAPTAIN OF THE FOOTBALL TEAM."
._.
one of the three
lol
lol assume wednesday
wednesday would be nice
ok bed
nite
nao do you mind if i put your address in the even thingy?
sure
ok because i already did
lol
these mods on the SE workshop are really cool
i just subscribed to a bunch
lol
also does your mom want me to like...pick up anything?
food or drink wise?
nope
tell her she's awesome
She's too old for you mr.tony
hey tony
you here?
no
decosine
art thou available for thundering (for about an hour)?
We should play unturned together. Needs more content though
i still havent looked at unturned, someone said it looked cool though
Did someone say
war thunder
yes i am germany
lets goooo
okay
(for an hour()
give me ten minutes
)
k
lol
make it
i have to get off at 4
lol
okay
It's pretty fun for a few hours but is lacking new content. It's being actively developed though.
I am loading war thunder
so i just played unturned a little bit
i never found a backpack
and died like 10 times
lol
The items shouldn't despawn
You may have to restart the game to spawn new drops
i would enjoy playing unturned with someone later
just did the tutorial
it seems nice
bbl
it seems like it'd be much more fun with people
i just tried playing and died twice after finding some useless stuff
reminds me of dayz but blocky
and better ui
but still lots of death and depression
lol
yeah, definitely a game to be played with others
lets just say so far i'm glad i didnt have to pay for it
lol
okhai
hi
did you need help setting anything up?
tis all already set up
dude
D:
:Dude
lol well we have 5 confirmed
lol
5 including or excluding us?
including us
we had 1 drop
is Mr Cooney coming?
yus
so is future Mrs. Cooney
then I'll get to match a face to the voice :D
lol
same with him
I'm trying something new with the controls
Using my G13 rather than a full keyboard
??
huh ok
will other people be intimidated by that?
also a wireless mouse
nah
lol
if it doesn't work out we can just grab a keyboard
lol
I really should buy a wireless keyboard
it's pretty much going to be trying to make Sarah and Anthony play
lol
Wireless is so nice
I guess I should probably hook the good speakers up out there
much thanks
uploading to Google Play
woo
It's on Google Play :D
woot!
(it can take an hour or two to show up though)
ok headed over soon
oquay
safe journeys
oquay
erm
will let you know
when Mai is ready >w<
lol
i don't think it'd be awkward if you hosted Anthony and sarah lol
too awkward
lol ok headed over
safe journeys
fare well
brandoni
How to 3rd person in space engineers again?
nvm
welp
sorry if that didn't meet and/or exceed expectations
nah it was fun
lol
I've driven by that multiple times
o.o I've seen that
I didn't know it was right next to a graveyard though
whaaat
seriously
Apparently it's a graveyard full of gold rushers who died due to a plague
o.o
haunted uber
lol
has to be
"Clown Motel next to the graveyard of plagued miners is where we're staying."
nope
I also pass by the haunted goldfield hotel
It's amazing I aven't picked up a ghostly hitch-hiker yet
lol is that a future plan
lol Goldfield
war
thunderrrrrr
i have 8 hours or so (maybe six) to play premium war thunder
gogogo

Ian
customize a 3d printed bracelet

(Sorry Ment)
vgs
and it's bork lol
"Something broke. Not you. Us. Try again?" :<
hi
hi
androo
hilo
hi
so you will be in vegas when?
i will no longer be coming to vegas sadly
:F
o
well then
jurk
alex decided she would rather work
lame
who would rather work?!
not my choice obviously lol
i wanted ricardos
but yeah
lame
so this next week i'll have absolutely nothing to do at work :F
thats no fun
free money though
We still gonna attempt escape-the-room ?
yes
any days open on the room you want to try?
(because it gives me an excuse to take a day off and be less bored through the week)
lemme see
lol
It's things like this that will get you in a SAW-movie type situation
only if we do the SAW room
xD
trap room tuesday at noon could work
would it just be us, or would other people also go?
erm
ooh
let me ask
others wanted to do the saw room
saw room doesn't open till saturday
I get off work at 10:30 so that's possible
oh
we could wait and do it when I am back for a few days in october
might be better...
If we get 4+ people we get a better deal on the tickets
and october would likely have holloween specials
twoo
so are we going to play unturned any time soon?
we should
i need to go get a haircut but perhaps in a few hours we could play if other people want to join too
i want to
Graphic Design: You can tell me how to do my job as long as you pay me for it.
I need some pro nazi propaganda
on the cheap
can you do it?
anything going against my morals skyrockets the price
Aw come on
you can be a nazi
Doesn't it sound like fun?

1'll st0p

lol the skype notifications are going off the scale
Now I see why, I'll see who makes it back alive
no 1 will
lol
y0u totally missed that chance
1 didn't
i quit :3
why d0 you quit?
1 dunno why he quit
cus the numbers started to bore me more than boredom did
wow
"The Doctors" is already a group in Steam :<
yeah
so
i got my haircut
is it unturned time?
lol
yes
but we can't be in a group :<
at least not named
well we could make a group that isn't named The Doctors
what would that be?
lol NOS?
Rx?
Desert Suns?
Zair?
it was zair, right?
it was zair
we could always just do the goon haven group
twoo
ok
wat is twoo
true
oh
that makes more sense now
lol
well, I'll be in the dayminerustcraft channel on mumble
b17 is op
run in, get a base, make 10 grand a match
lol yup
I loves me a B-17
im researching the g
That's my 2nd favourite bomber in the game
g8n1?
Yes
yeah that thing is op :P
dear god
i just got 25k vehicle research from one match
blew up two bases and critted a fw190
lol
I had dinner
dafuq
did they really do an AMA and only answer one question?
with a 1 word answer
oh nvm all but one answer got hidden by massive downvoting
your tripmine just scared the crap out of me tony
hi
hi
So tony and I made some good progress with Unturned yesterday
Got backpacks, cars, a farm, and a house going
They need to make the map like 20x bigger and add a server browser though
indeed
It gets a bit repetative currently.
the crafting aspect is pretty fun
it's pretty easy to get a good farm going. Though I found out the hardway that zombies hate crops
lol
brb
I'm gonna move our farm to our roof once I gather more wood
back
lol yeah I was thinking of keeping it slightly more realistic. But I could see myself farming up on some building.
Possibly the lighthouse
rooftop gardens are pretty popular in some places :p
haha indeed they are
I found out the hard way last night that zombies attack player made stuff
and that zombies can be surrounding you the moment you spawn in
i loaded the world and saw a person standing in front of me
i was like "wat? that cant be tony..."
then I got jumped by 6 zombies lol
Could build a bridge out to that island near the town with the expensive bananas
haha
that's what we did :p
hahaha
we built the bridge by the S.S. Haven
to the central island
Seems like that's the common strategy
yeah, only thing I don't like is how it isn't very flat
I think I'd prefer to just build in a nice flat field in the future
Yeah. I'm sure things will get better once the guy adds more content
I imagine that usa is battling the goa'uld Isis in Iraq, makes reading/watching the news more bareable
lol
lol WBC did an ama years ago
so anyone watch House of Cards?
watched the first half of the first episode and decided i wasnt ready to get hooked on another show yet
I have returned!
unturned? :D
in a bit
gotta put groceries away and clean the kitchen real quack
i'm down
k server is up at 68.224.241.164
but when you join
you will lkely be surrounded by zombies
so i'll go clear out the boat first
lol ok
want to mumble?
boat's clear
yes
cool
my mic isnt feedbacking is it?
howdy y'all
howdy partner!
it's a right fine day here in the ol' province of reno, how is it round your parts?
It's miiiighty fine!
lol
You take a restin' day off work, mister?
I might, but I might also do a lil workin from home
But I can do that tonight
or whenever
lol
nice
alex is work til 4
so i r bore
we should do something about that
i was thinking b-17 spam in war thunder to get jets
lol
or unturned
or something else
i'd prefer unturned or something else
lol
NO
WAR THUNDER
NOW
lol
lol
apparently space engineers is going to xbone
but its not even a fully finished game
why they work on porting already
well it's made with microsoft technologies
so porting it is really easy
to other microsoft stuff
true
guess that makes sense then
but they have 2 teams
an xbone team and a pc team
orly
yeah
nice
unturned 3.0 looks promising
i'm pretty happy with what they've done so far, compared to their other space mining game thingy
what is in it?
lol miner wars
yeah that one
it can support 16x larger maps
wow
more weapons/items
tons of optimizations
unturned needs modding support
modding support
lol
lol
you can add items and stuff via steam workshop
nice
also a map editor
is there an item editor or do you have to code it in?
you make the model but then you can set what kind of item it is
like a fishing rod
then you can set properties about it
cool
like what bait it can use etc
this kid is impressing me
lol
friggin canadians
terraria, unturned, etho
stargate
such canada
wow
(good thing courtney cant see how we praise her country)
(yeah)
()0Oo
.
I want to ()pen the door
openDoor()
lol
so
my desk looks amazing
pics or it didnt happen
ok 1 sec
wow
nice
too much work to move it to my room here and move my computer stuff for just like a few days of use though
lol
although
i kinda want to do that
lol
but it wouldnt fit in here without some major movement of the stuff that's already in here
does that area under the drawer fit your tower?
yeah
thats awesome
i'll have my tower under the right drawer and printer/whatever under the left
i found a p90 on unturned last night
wow
nice
well, shall we play a game?
sure, lemme finish this b-17 round real quack
kkkkkkready
what shall we play?
i do not know
lol\
we could try to find a Timberwolf on unturned
wat is tha
sniper rifle
ooh
400m range 1 shot kill 20x scope
wow
yes please
lol ok
i'll start the server
k
i mumble now
68.224.241.164
p90 :O
sonuvabitch my email isn't getting sent to gmail
doesn't send to scybreak@Gmail.com
did you set it up to do so?
i did
I don't know if changing my website premissions will break it though
I remember I tinkered with a lot of stuff before I realized I could jsut root into ftp
....this is sketch
not even a "reset password" email
tony

orly
if sir ian is home, i am bearcatting the realistics
that's based on actual mic data :D
that's cool
loool i just got terror of the sky in a b-17
oh by the way
did you guys see that half life 3 was actually confirmed?
calling bs?
Source 2 had a soft launch last week
~last week
with it came a lot of updates and some hints to game files
L4D 3 is one
maybe even Team Fortress 3
and of course HL3
unless
of course
Valve is just mega trolling us
can you people reach reddit?
It hasn't been officially confirmed
Currently it looks like L4D3 is happening but until valve announces something directly, it's all rumor
BLAAAAAARGH
well
hl3_imported
confirmed
but that isn't from a 100% reliable confirmed source
@_@ it's so damn close though
this soundwave wallpaper is so mesmerizing
lol
it's also laughably unoptimized and hacked together right now
and running at 100 fps
lol
so it kills my battery
but the proof of concept is here :D
i can play a sine wave from my computer and it actually shows a sine wave :D
lol
nao question
mez answer
actually first of all did you realize you 4 wore similarly colored shirts?
no
lol my original question was who is pink
can't be a sister of Katie
katie's sister
._.
lol
ok vastly different bone structure
actually
yeah
it's like you took the sister's head and stretched it horizontally
brb photoshop
ok that becomes uber apparent
don't share that btw
bored
lol
i need an endless supply of these chocolate covered bananas
lol
tony: http://imgur.com/gallery/sAZzxac
lol
dude yes
I think we need to do something before you leave
tots
we should tp his house
I'm down
war thunder is having one of those events where if you complete the ahievements then you get ridonkulous amounts of lions and if you complete certain ones you get free premium vehicles
@_@
indeed
Can't pass up free lions!
lol
i knowwwww
Lol
What should we do before I leave?
noooooooooooo idea
@_@
food items perhaps?
nothing really comes to mind lol
lol
canes or In N Out works for me
both of those exist in reno
lol
go somewhere unique
like ricardos :(
Being in the presence of Mez is unique to Las Vegas
...there's Wet N' Wild
meh
lol
lol same XD
this sound wave wallpaper is so cool
lol
did you write it or just find it?
I wrote it
wow
nice
i heard that
whatever it was
?
i heard a skype DL noise
server up? :3
it can be
in a sec, lemme finish this episode of Voyager
Mike wants to play
either your server or his
either is fine with me
(doesn't have to be your server if ya can't be bothered)
righto
my episode will be over in 4 minutes
oquay
what's the plan
u host
we show him ropes
we kill zombies or build more?
k mumble?
68.224.241.164
k
mumble
I LEFT
YOU RIGHT
WE DOWN
so i guess i'm going for the 11:30 train
clearly missed my 9:30 attempt
mike found a chainsaw
o.o
WOO
you fellas still playing?
mike and I are
imma hop on
good, you have the 3rd generator :p
i'm researching a jet now :3
oh yeah
i forgot
lol
wakka wakka
my computer just told me my processor was at 73 degrees celcius
is that a lot?
its 163F
not sure if that's hot or not
thats a lot
weird
oh
safe is around 90c
yeah just saw that
not surprised, since the game warns you about turning all the graphics to max
lol
i turned to max and got a bit below 30 fps
so i turned it down a notch
i still got 34-37 somehow
removed sun rays and set something else down a bit
i'm only running two screens
so that could help
yeah
anyways, off to bed
the weird thing is i have no idea what gave me the temp warning
lol yeah that doesn't usually happen
like what program
yeah
i'd guess your mobo software
i know my mobo has temp regulation and warnings and stuff yeah, i just hadnt seen it til now
anywho, night :P
my cpu is at 42*c
how do you check?
i checked with AI suite
ah
mine is at 47* now
cooled pretty quick
yeah
okay 5 real now
bed
night
lol night
wow
so I just fixed that bug I spent 6 hours on yesterday in like 10 minutes
also last night I was googling this bug and found a StackOverflow question that described my problem exactly
I got all excited and scrolled down to see if there were any answers
then I realized I was the one who wrote the question 7 hours ago and it still had no replies
i freaking hate when that happens :/
lol
I'm just glad it works and it isn't an ugly solution
im glad i got to sleep in today... getting up at 4am every day isnt very fun
once i get to work, it isn't that bad, but still, 4am
ermagerd
off of work at 2:30
got in at 6:30 am
shit went down
202 cases of new shoes
room for maybe 100 ~ 150
napped
walker inspiration?
that thing is awesome
you could almost definitely make something like that in space engineers too, though it'd be a pain to set up
woah
new steam icon
lol they had a visual update
looks kinda cool
steam can also hide games in your library now
...huh
neat
in case you don't want anyone to see that embarassing copy of Just Dance: Belieber Edition?
or if you are tired of DOTA 2 test or Arma 2 Operation Arrowhead Beta (Outdated)
aaaah
So I just had some damn good salsa
made my Mexicans
Mexicans-from-Mexico
Habaneros
So I beat the main skyrim quest
do I play it to super completion or do I find a new game...
now you play mods
lol
but... other games
SE update has some cool new stuff
..it does
but what to make
an array of dissassembly drones that fly in a programmable cylindrical shape so that you can set them up to grind down any ship
that's actually very possible
but only of a certain size
in practice it probably wouldn't work
nvm, in practice it definitely wouldn't work
why not?
a number of things
you'd have to make them dock
docking has magnets
that would make them rotate in subtle but significant ways
make what dock?
the disassembly drones
aww why?
they need to drop off their stuff after grinding?
lol
I was just thinking of having a floating cylinder
ohhhhh fuck
right
anyways
physics is also not 100% predictable
two identical drones with identical settings won't behave identically
very slowly over time they will drift apart
whenever they move
if it ever gets nudged at all it will be destroyed
yeah
so basically physics won't allow it
aww
buttons now control actions
daaaaaamn
wireless control :D
antenna broadcast
oh my god
this game is getting impossibly complex
lol
like I have no idea how I'm going to use all these
gate control
DUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUDE
ok so now the game is less of "what can I make with these parts" and more of "I want to make this. The parts are probably there"
yeah until they fix the fact that the game runs like a parapalegic after just 10 minutes I think I'll wait on building more stuff >_>
lol
really I can't run the game for more than 10 minutes
look at his horrific mouth
he is the chosen one
Does anyone else cringe when they see someone wearing a Trench coat in public?
In Vegas?
my school mascot wore a trench coat
he was a "hacker"
he was a "maverick"
We knew what they meant
lol
I miss LoL
but I have no friends D:
I need to play with m31ster
sleep(value); push(value);
best sorting algorithm ever
what's everyone up to today?
workin on my wallpaper app
i discovered why the wave was so choppy
it's much nicer now
nice
Trying to gather resources to build on unturned, rather difficult
backpack + axe
^
alicepack and chainsaw
yeah
i want to play unturned
:F
Thought about going to see Lucy, any thoughts?
lucy looks cool
We can when you've got time :P
lucy looks really cool
andrew just has a crush on whatsherface
anything scar-jo i can get behind
lol
*zing*
Though very similar to Transcendence and Limitless
similar, yes
but they don't quite get telekenesis
I got free micro on github for 2 years
what's that?
private repositories
5 of them
normally costs $7/month
wow, nice
how'd you get that?
all you have to do is prove you're a student
lol
well then
lol
that's how i got free you need a budget
i just sent them a copy of my transcript since we don't have .edu emails
Most of our institutions have gmail accounts now :/
at least they have gmails
we have to supply our own!
Not such a bad idea, frees up some resources
yeah
still though a lot of places look for .edu emails
yeah
Originate offers @originate.com emails but they are directed through gmail
and the email client is via gmail
our school has an actual proof of enrollment feature on mynevada
o rly
yeah under academics or something
i've needed to provide proof of enrollment twice in the last month
would have been handy
Easy enough to get a the student admin
at*
Get it together murica
yeah it literally says verification of enrollment under the my academics tab lol
do we have a gh unturned server?
Well today I got a letter from my municipality. Apparently i've moved
lool wow brandon check your email
Nah we don't thal said he will not host any alpha games
our school just sent an email asking if we wanted an email for life service
i thought eolk had one set up, some of the guys were talking about getting him to update it
wow
so we're getting .edu emails? lol
possibly
yeah hopefully
thats amazing
lol
yep
lol
afk, exit interview time
ooh nice
good luck
lol
I wonder if this would work in an interview http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scopolamine
minecontrol drug. When in powdered form with make you highly suggestble to suggestion/commands
I don't think you could get any in such short notice
that email is an @nevada.unr.edu email through gmail
back
finally got an originate sweater
lol
lol nice
guys
why is math broken
because fish
damn fish
seriously though this math works on wolfram but not in my app
oh
i did 135/4096 instead of 135f/4096f
lol
lol
lol. the .edu signup page says it doesn't work and to come back after the formal announcement
but, it works
@_@
i has .edu email :D
woo
I now have 4 gmail accounts though >_<
lel
if I don't log in to them in the exact same order on every machine, then my bookmarks don't work correctly
that's a pain lol
...taht's horrible
whelp i started a single player unturned game, decided to set up shop at the beach :P
well you could help me if ya like :P
213.233.252.126
blew up 2 cars, got one stuck, a few others out of as lol
lol
perhaps later, gotta go pick up the gf from work in a sec
alrighty
update is looking mighty good
indeed
you see the base he linked a video to at the bottom
?
it's pretty epic
wow
doing something like that would be fun
kinda need trees to properly respawn though
yep
otherwise taking down the server every half hour would be a necessity (and a pain)
yeah
I really want to do a role play-ish server like that though
we should
we need a dedicated one though
where people have actual jobs
we could bug yolk to host
we could
he would
i could manage it if he doesn't want to
you should
yeah a lil update just came out a while ago
maybe it fixed trees lol
sucks you cant have other people administer medicine and stuff
could be actual doctors :P
lol
i don't think it did
a minor update
so my wallpaper works now but my phone can't maintain a stable framerate :(
turns out drawing 1080 lines at 24 fps is hard
lol
woo
900 miles
in one week
so fun
wow
I'll be driving around 450 miles tomorrow
woo
fun times in driving land
what time tomorrow you leaving?
probably early
blargh
did you want to do anything tonight @_@
i've no ideas
I'll probably just be packing stuff
WOO FUN
x_x
lol yeah ok
woo i'm back and alex is at rileys til like 7
lets play a game woo
woo
MEOW
i'm down
wat to play?
i say brandog should throw up dat unturned server :P
i can't
no idea
not at home
aw
y u no
at work
y u so
afk
that did not work
lol
lel?
it was a picture of my unturned character looking like a turtle :P
hah
does "Communication" count as skills?
for resume stuff?
. . .
CS:GO is 50% off...
yum
ice cream cake
that sounds delicious
it is
anyone know where to find a cane
walmart
why? lol
You mean a cool one?
a wooden curved one
bamboo preferable
A smoke shop
I'm going to be a barker at a theme wedding this weekend
or world market
Smoke shops always carry the best canes
huh
No really
I believe that actually.
Go try one near you, the bigger and the fancier the better. Most all smoke shops have them
so ian
Yes?
i'm researching the p80
lol
well
not yet
F7F is due out next patch
i have to buy the second p51 first
what's that?
2 bearcat engines
1 frame
wow that's pretty cool
Its the Navy F-82
Except good
like the lovechild of a panther and a bearcat
lol
no surprise it's called the tigercat
But yes, you have to get the F-82 Twin Mustang
oh i got that already
Oh
i need to buy the p51d30
Oh
lol
"I need to find <object>."
"Try eBay"
Thank you you useless waste of carbon.
yeah
lol
i ran out of lions after buying the f82 and the cannon bearcat
Do you haz B-17G?
yessir
that's how i researched all the t4s
lol
B-24?
halfway researched
Oh
B-24 > P-51 D30
spending my research points on that while trying to get moneys
well yeah
but its also way more expensive
lol
And faster
Its faster too
and a smaller target
>.>
<.<
it flies like less of a brick then the 17 as well
the b24?
oh
yes
i thought you were comparing it to the p51
lol
oh
when you said it was smaller i was like wuuut
I don't like the american manufactured moostangs
nor do i
but save money for jets i must
I have nearly 2.6 mill loins just waiting for this next update
wow
yeah i have 200k
I have to buy 7 new Japan planes
at least 3 of which are jets
and then the Ho 229
i still want the ho229 :F
i havent made any progress with germany though
although, the me410 b6 is almost done
Germany Tier IV is the hardest to fly
dem battleratings
they also rape things with their big guns
the 410 b6 rips b17's apart
I cry every FW
The 109 G series isn't too bad though
the 109 k4 keeps murdering me
lol
my bearcat gets rapeed
i try to climb but it no climb high nuf
K4 is easy to out turn
and if i climb high enough then by the time i get there everyone is dead or near the ground
Just make him drain his energy
lol
You only really have to watch out for Ki-84's and Tempest II's
those hurt as well
i'm just really not very good in realistic lol
You probably don't see too many K4's in realistic, up at that tier you see more Ta 152s
Which are quite dangerous
i saw a few of them
but
they were all dumb
they tailsat my b17
and i killed them and got tons of research
lol
wow
10/10 Ta pilots
lol
I normally worry about them coming from space to destroy me
but I guess not
i really have no idea how to use altitude to my advantage other than sweep down for one shot and hope you hit something
Altitute works as energy, your goal is smiply to keep it, after a sweep you need to use your speed to get out of your enemies' gun range or switch to a different type of tactic
i just usually get bored or overconfident and lose too much energy lol
Energy fight instead then?
Or be Japan
Just turn everything to death
yeah if i was japan it'd be better for my playstyle
lol
You'd probably do well as England too
yeah i thought that as well
Or be Russia and not really accel at anything
except arcade mode
lol
even then, Russians lose their edge at tier IV
true
hello fellow human beings
hullo haman boing
how doin?
good
just got back home
buen
so apparently I am an ambassador for Originate now
what does that entail?
He's the new intern bait.
lol
I'll be hanging out with them at the career fair, I can tell people about Originate and try to get them to apply there, etc
if I get people to apply and they get hired I get a bonus
oh nice
wow
nice
He's the *shiny* new intern bait.
I can also try to find people to listen in on Originate's tech talks
But that's awesome.
i'm gonna find it really funny when i end up at a career fair and you're there trying to preach originate :P
lol
lol
Come brothers. I will show you the crucible of creation where all things....
Originate.
*claps*
why must nice chairs cost so much?
because a team designed them so well
but $1200 for a chair?
it seems like they would make more sales and make more money if it cost less
The Aeron chair was expensive as hell when it first came out
That's the meshed back thing right?
yus
Those are so weird
tl,dr: Tesla Car drivetrain warranty increased to infinite miles
Applies retroactively
Still only an 8 year warrenty though
basically they're saying "drive the fuck out of it" :D
awww
my mom rated my app at 5 stars
lol
lol
how many ratings?
lol woo
i would rate it but i have super cool beta version
lol
still called graphit?
dude
yep
dood
graphit pops out among all the other icons
it's like YO HEY SUP
yeah
it's a nice icon
lol
so proud
a good icon sells the app
when i look for apps i judge them by their icon
yay i win
ok awesome your mom was actually competent in the review
not like I'M SO PROUD OF MY SON
although dat last name
still, beastly.
i still say monochrome those icons but the color coordination is good if you plan on displaying multiple
my audio wave wallpaper is coming along nicely
it's much less spaztic now
but i still don't understand how AudioRecord.read works
so i'm not actually sure how to make it display the last x seconds of audio
currently it displays the last 1.5ish seconds
well gentledoctors
i am going to shut down to pack up my computer
may the force be ever in your favor
WHY
WHY MUST I HAVE WINDOWS UPDATES
lol i so could have called that one
too bad i was asleeping :F
interesting
saw one of the mindcrackers play that
looked pretty cool
indeed
wow
yes I saw
Hi
Hi
Good Evening
hola
donde esta brandoni?
ohai
i miss anything?
barndoni has successfully landed in the renos
nothing other than that
yay
countdown to WT begins
oh that video i linked is war thunder cool destructable environment stuff
yesss
i'm pretty psyched
i've been trying to flex my sociable muscles recently so i'll probably actually enjoy the concert vibe once we get to it lol
lol
wait you're not sociable?
how do you unsocial people always fool me
lol
i'm usually good around peeps that i know for a fact enjoy the things i do
like you guys
woo
but when i go out just randomly then i'm a bit antisocial
lol
and when alex invites me to her friend's things i usually turn them down because meh, video games :P
recently i've been going though
and they're fun :D
lol
awesome
I'm trying to get Mai to actually come be social and get off her phone >_< buuuut
yeah.. :<
I feel terrible when I'm out having a good time talking with people and I see her alone in a corner staring at her phone :<
Lol. I am much excite for WT/Amaranthe
War Thunder?
i can haz thunder
ian-san
(three minutes since he messages and i missed him, impressive)
well, for any ians who in the future would like to war thunders, i am playing and in a random mumble channel :P
wat
the urls for gyfcat are terrible but it's a 4k reference
Yello
green
greenight :P
once you get your stuff set up we need to play some unturned, i'm craving some :F
vgh
agreed
handy crafting cheat sheet
you
vva
can't for the life of me figure out how to add a wall above the doorway
you need supports on the side dont you?
like posts or something?
or at least a foundation on top before you place the wall
it's a doorway with 2 posts on the side and above that 2 posts aswell
you have a foundation on that wall's level?
i'm pretty sure you have to place walls on top of foundation or platforms or whatever they're called
nope
it would be a double wall
an entryway with a higher ceiling
maybe I'm expecting too much :P
Been building a structure. Nothing as impressive as that compound but yeah
lol
i'm sure once you find out the mechanics behind it you're gonna make something crazy cool
you should try emulating some type of architecture and see if it's possible with the current building mechanics
Lol
Yeah i've been playing around with the building mechanics, waiting for the updates.
part building and removing sections is currently a bit frustrating but it's all in the game. Salvaging structure sections would be a great feature.
No internettttttt
Can't even post pics to r/battlestations
lel
wait
then how skype
phone
lol
you coulda come over here and uploaded, or just creeped outside the door for a minute to finish the upload
:F
lol
so
my router doesn't work
>_<
gotta go return it
oh fun :<
vgs
i have internet if i hook directly in to the modem at least
wooo
tocksman has a dedicated unturned server up 76.72.167.214
:P
beautimous
nice setup
and yayy for the server :P
this router is stoopid
did you guys see the new space engineers video in steam?
like the first vid
nuts
damn that was sooo much easier
returned the router and got a new one
this one just worked. instantly
LOL
erm
lol
jeeze tony it wasn't THAT funny
Brandon-san, would you prefer if I didn't raugh router?
great you're incoprorating accents in to puns now? D:
only if it's necessary
wouldn't have worked otherwise
I was actually thinking that was a bit of a stretch
lol
i miss battlefield
woo chromecast is set up now
so say I have 5 people
then let's say I add 5 more people to that group
did I just get a 50% increase or a 200% increase?
50% increase
thank you
no
no
100% increase
lol ok
thank you
could I ask you all a favor?
plz plz pllllzzz critique my resume?
sure
let me know wha tyou would change, why you would change it, what works, what doesn't, etc.
even if it's seemingly insignificant, plz
andross plz
Ian plz
are you looking to work for a company or get contract work?
company
r&r partners
then I'd suggest toning back the scybreak theme
because that makes it appear to be my primary focus rather than a potential employer
so remove S?
I would
ok
Also it seems like you list AIGA president in two locations
i do
one was awarded to me
another one was professional development
i'd only list that once
ahah
where would you keep it?
because I also have carpe noctum twice, going off of that
probably prof. development just so that it isnt a one item section
ok
I'd say it's slightly better to leave white space than to repeat stuff to fill up room
also employers like people who work on their stuff as a hobby as well as professionally - perhaps you could include something you did on the side?
since carpe/aiga were school related
would that be under freelance stuff?
i'd put it under personal projects or something
the point is to show that you enjoy your line of work even if it isn't for money or academic requirements
ok, cool
do you know if any other Doctors are here?
no clue
oy
ok time to hit up facebook
thank you brandon
vva
i am looking at it now
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
or i will be when i find where skype sends my downloads
lol
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
we should play a game or something
oh nvm the sending failed
i am board
tony is probably offline
so it cant send
we are going to play poker/card games once we finish this tv stand
it is almost done
also i think eric is coming over at like 1030 to watch dumb and dumber since the new one comes out soonish
i just remembered that i dont have classes on fridays
that is awesome
perhaps i shall come visit you in a little bit?
neighbor
suarr
we don't either
nabhur
we should coordinate some weekly event for friday fun
lol
because neighbors do that
curse you
lol
i am here
also what is your schedule like? perhaps we can car pool
sec, i email you picture of schedule to brandon.worl@gmail
because on phone
not sure if your printer allows, but i think a stripe of that blue you use there on either the bottom or left side would look really nice
Huh, I may do that for my more "edgier" one
I was told to do a classic / edgy / insane version
idk about graphic design resumes but decorative stripes are advised against for engineering resumes
lol
if the imagery overtakes the text, it's too insane
even for design
like this: http://media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/ef/f0/c4/eff0c4ce719f96afe056598e5160cd3b.jpg is edgy
this: http://media-cache-ec0.pinimg.com/736x/1c/c1/e4/1cc1e48139ad5f391accd24e.jpg is too much
aha
it basically says "please ignore the data"
er "please ignore how little data I have"
well if this is the classic version then yeah i'd say that's fine
lol
yeah it looks good
i see that one and think "looks nice, too much effort required to read - next!"
lol
it may just be my eye but do you have some kind of bold-inconsistency in there?
lol
nvm
just me
between what and what
lol whew ok
like where it says Production Artist and Sales Associate and Carpe Noctum Creative Director
but it was just me
the spacing between photo manipulation and vector illustration is a bit odd in hte skills section
kinda looks like one phrase, not two separate skills
ahah
i may ahve to tab those out a smidge
oh wait shit no you're absolutely right
FUCK ITS' ALREADY BEEN SENT oh well
could add one word to make the summary more edgy, my english teachers always said threes flow better than twos for some reason, so like: "While learning about the industry, will provide the company with fast, creative designs..." to "While learning about the industry, will provide the company with fast, quality, creative designs..." (added quality)
lool
ahah
meh, i think mistakes make things more memorable
so it may be a good thing :P
lol
got me a frozen banana
hot damn
also overdone: http://media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/62/86/12/629ac3725da64744870f2dca9c2d.jpg
lol
It is missing many elements
so i had an idea for something amazing
i am going to take a banana and melted chocolate... and blend them together
and then i will freeze the mix
i may throw a taquito in it too just for fun
know what's good?
Vanilla icecream, chocolate syrup, banana, and a spoonful of peanut butter
It's like a Reese's milkshake
that last resume was incorrect
she had a soccerball where the paper clearly said it was a football
we start/stop at the same time on mondays, andrew
but we have gaps in the middle so car pooling may not really work
if people need to go home during gaps
damn them gaps
lol
gaps = lab
your schedule is perfectly structured pretty much
yeah
lol
16 hours of gap
in a week
that kinda sucks
but
i'm gonna try to convince sushil to get me a work laptop
that's 14 or so hours of lab work probably
that would be good
so i can just do the last few hours at home
your current one sucks
lol
lol
it was so alright too
and then i got my desktop
and it became terrible
same with my laptop pretty much lol
it worked
then it didnt as soon as my desktop was finished being built
lol
well i'm a tard
just realized my AC vent has been closed this entire summer
it held on to life just long enough, and when the burden was lifted it died
RIP
right over my computer
haha
wow
yeah
gg tony
gg
no re
yeah
yeah....
so i just realized brandon
we have no table to poker on
:F
we could do it here :D
we could indeed
we may
we should!
this thing is taking longer than expected lol
but it is ACTUALLY almost done now
what thing?
oh
that
lol
are the directions in swedish or something?
nah its like a full on complicated thing with doors and shit, and it had 33 tiny ass nails we had to pound in to put the backing on so that took forever
lol
it's also about eight to eighteen (i forget the width of our tv) inches short of our tv's width, so it's probably gonna look funky
lol
we good to come over? we're done
sure
cool! it actually looks really cool btw, i'll take a pic and show ya
why are you people getting on so late
just had another guy log onto steam and play Borderlands 2
cuz tacos
wat
you know
taco monday
mhmm
better inventory in 3.0 :D
awesome... i didg the public editor
when's it out? Thursday?
we should definitely create a map
i think we could do a good job with balance and stuff
not out thursday, next news post is thursday
I think the update will be out once it's done
^
yeah
quiet you
we should play a game
i cannot at the current moment :F
-Rather than only having one character you can now create several and customize each one individually with a name, appearance and specialty
specialty
jobs
brandon your wish was granted
lol
lol
I still want to play league
but no one leagues
what else can we pla
specialty might not necessarily mean jobs though
well yeah
but it might add to that aspect of the game
i want to pray game
why u no pray?
pray what
is everyone praying unturned
I'm currently on atm
on GH?
tocksmans server yeah
<<< 
mumble?

There's food at the farm near my shack

okey doke
hey brandog, want to play poker either now or sometime later? Katie is coming over in a bit
sure, how about after i finish this episode of voyager?
sounds good to me
tonizzle want to bf4 til then?
i'm down
mumblez?
yup
also
at some point
you guys should teach me poker
What are you guys all talking about?
Besides poker
I can teach that
I play
just gaming
they're gonna have a poker shindig
annnnd gonna try Dota
nope I'm gonna read about DOTA and realize I wanna do League instead lol
You've never poker'd before?
neither had brandog or alex
but yeah
poker shindig went well
i won
lol
poker is fun
we could bring some cards and chips and play when you come up for that WT concert
ahhh yissss got my new mouse pad
pic
and yes we could and should
also
remember that spicy things are spicy twice
<<< 
plz esplain
You have a digestive tract with 2 ends
ah yes...
I ate habanero based salsa
I still want to eat the habanero
good or the sinuses
oooooh yeah
for*
Have you ever had scotch bonnet peppers?
I've not.
ah
Explain?
Not much to explain, they are pretty hot
lol
I'll google reaction videos
You people see the 1KB hard drive on Reddit? In MC?
moose pad
and yes
ok that is genius
idgaf that is GENIUS
are you watching a let's play?
?
yes
lol
lol
how much karma does your battlestation have jeeze
like 11 votes :(
lol aww
We use them alot to cook with... well not here in the netherlands. They're on par with the habanero
lol yeah a lot of recipes seem to have them interchangeable
I use tabasco for migraine management :P
lol jeeze
and here I am just using it for food
lol desperation will drive a man to do the crazy
It was either that or trepanation
Tabasco ftw
or the drugs the doctor prescribes
vgy
lol
saw that coming
i am extremely envious of your mousepad
that is epic
lol
it got here in less than 72 hours of ordering it
probably less than 50 hours actually
impressive
lol'd at sparkles' laptop :P
I saw the thumbnail and the title earlier and thought he for sure lost his camera or laptop or something, turned out i was right
lol
lol
i'm trying to turn my tv in to a chromecasted whiteboard
but this app is stoopid :(
with your tablet?
yeah
it'd probably work well with my phone since i have that s-pen
yeah
dunno how i'd cast the screen though
i have a capacitive stylus I can use too
ah
i want to war thunder
i want to eat food
cake time
i had a grilled cheese with bacon
it was good
i made a fruit and yogurt parfait
i want to battlefield
they got rid of void fog \o/
wat is that
the dark stuff at the bottom of mc maps
oh woo
that means they no longer have to tick air blocks at all
so TPS will go up
nice
is it an option or is it just straight up gone?
gone
dang
take optifine and go one step further lol
can't really be an option
yeah i was thinking about htat
ticking is done serverside and the reason for removing it was to improve ticking
why would they need ticking for void fog? the particles or something?
sunlight removes void fog
so they have to tick to see if air is exposed to the sky
ahh
that makes sense
brandon should get bf4 for pc
maybe
it's cheaper than I expected it would be
he should
also
i assume I'd have to buy all of the DLC too?
nope
we don't have dlc
we just go shooting people like it's a holiday
do you have china rising?
i don't htink so
it comes with digital delux edition
theeeen maybe? one sec
lol now I have to fire up origin
oh i do
i have digital deluxe
also, ap, open all your battlepacks
ok, it's only $26.39
it unlocks things
and you can use them later
i guess i'll buy it
i guess we're playing :D
god i hate origin
lol
idk my username/password/email
ummmm one sec
you're Naosyth1
lol
or Naosyth
no Nao1
because Nao is on console or somesuch
Password isn't working, gonna do the whole reset thing
D: oh dear
knew about the battlepacks, just havent had time
lol
also i do have china rising
lol
also deluxe
but nothing else
yeah i got the dig deluxe
what is the probability of us ever wanting the other DLC? because it's way cheaper if I buy this all together
uh
I'm probably not gonna get any DLC
i rarely play as is
sitll not bored with common maps
although
well no lol
hopping on here is rare
then I'll just get delux
downloading
let me know when to fire it up
it's at 9% so far
WOO
is androo here?
i'm cooking dinner
alex works from 4-10
do you use your X12s on your computer?
so after i drop her off i can play
yes
that's the headset i've used 5ever
works great
how does it plug in?
lol
it has so many inputs
there's three plugs, the usb, the green headphone and the pink mic
yeah
so the xbox thing on the volume control isn't needed?
correct i think
i unplugged that
so yes
I'm gonna try these and see which of my headsets is better
nice
if you cant figure it out i'll come help you
I'm sure i'll manage :p
turtle
lol
it gave me a turtle pattern camo
!!!!!!!
lol
lol

lol
Commander mode is neat
4k from it...not bad
lol 8th best score

not sure what the source of that is
sure it's not sound?

no
lol
HOLY HELL i destroyed an enemy plane with a bomb
lol isnt that a great feeling?
i was flying low and he shot me down
so just before i hit the ground i dropped my bombs
he was following close enough that they got him
lol
I just had my first ever flat spin
that was epic
flew straight up at a guy, rocketed him, his debris clips my wing and sends me spinning like crazy
fell like 3km before i stabalized
in arcade you got into a flat spin?
yeah
impressive
lol

m31 how is the new poe update?
i've been thinking about making a return
civ V is 67% off
it's pretty good
i'd love for someone to join me on it tbh :/
have they added act iv yet?
no
but they did add some pretty damn cool stuff
cool
brb
daily missions in poe? yesplz
oh nice
that sounds fun
what do you get for them?
things and stuff :)
stalin
it would take too long to say in chat lol
lol
basically nothing is as it once was
Reddit is an interesting place
lol
so apparently PSN and LOL went down worldwide thanks to some kind of hacker group with lizard in the name
ah, lizard squad
lol
how were the jello shots last night?
well, they had a texture that reminded me of the quail egg i had on my birthday, so i nearly gagged every time i had one, though they did taste delicious
we played kings cup, that was fun
then we lipsynced songs for fun
lol
aaaand yeah
it was pretty cool
i went to sleep at 10 :F
damn
nice
i sold a card for warframe last night on steam that was worth a dollar
10 is now my normal sleep time :)
Juan jole dallores?
wat
One whole dollar?
oh
yeah
lol thal did the ice bucket challenge
did he?
he did
its on bookface
wut
apparently Jason Mamoa is playing Aquaman in Batman vs Superman
I LOVE JASON MAMOA
who
he's a pretty cool guy
why do they need aquaman
Justice League movie inbound
Doesn't matter if they need aqua man if Mamoa is playing him. He's a badass
pft
they should pull a marvel and do standalones
if they did I might actually go see martian manhunter
i miss anything fantabulous
?
i installed hydrated cooling into my computer and it is quiet now :D
oooh
fixed the fans?
yep
practically silent other than startup
nice
but that's normal
ok so
25 bucks on amazon
wat buy
go
arduino
that will be funded by parentals
what else
lol
as many m&m's as you can afford
that
or that
or this: http://www.amazon.com/Renova-Toilet-Paper-Tissue-Standard/dp/B0058O3BP4/ref=cm_lmf_tit_29
wat do
blend a taquito?
na
juice a meatloaf?
is this how you entertain yourselves?
no this is how we nourish ourselves
when you making taco soup and how do i steal several bowls worth of it?
._.
dunno yet
lol
a recall on defective" bean bags... the defect is that they have a zipper that can be opened
that isn't a defect >_>
lol
these "cans" have these weird "tabs" that makes holes in them
then they "leak"
i'm debating whether to make taco soup today or if I should wait a bit
I don't have fritos and those make it at least 73% better
oh hell no
wait
lol
lol
that's what I was thinking... definitely needs the fritos
also I have no clue where the old recipe is
i just bought all the ingredients I could remember
has anyone checked out Toxikk?
what's that?
some people are saying it's the PC version of Halo
like spiritually or somesuch
no levels, no classes, lots of vertical movement, etc.
I haven't looked into it (doing now)
but
it's like $15 for an early steam key
or $25 for 2
researching now, will let you know what I find
i'd like to know what level of development it's currently at
currently it's developed, right now they're polishing it
it looks like kickstarter style buy-in/funding
lol FAQ: Why does your store look like a kickstarter page
lol
i like how stuff like "no cover system" is a feature
lol
see I don't know if I want to buy in now because only $15
oooooorrr if it's just another "prepay" shindig
it does boast not free to play so I'm assuming it's not pay to win
i love the feel of older style shooters
so if there's no microtransactions and a decent player base I'd love it
huh...
you can even apply for a Free SDK
where's it say that?
Joystiq review
i'll try to source it
oh
FAQs
#5
cool
yeah so I dunno
i'm hunting for reviews
someone in PCMR said "don't whine about Halo, get amped about this (toxikk)" or something along those lines
the game definitely looks like an Unreal game
^
and there is also the upcoming free Unreal 4 game which may overshadow this
it looks fun but not worth 15 bucks yet
its like renx
it looks cool
and shows promise
but if the playerbase dies, whooptydo
hrm
well RenX's problem was that it had/has no playerbase
right
lol
and they were painfully slow at fixing bugs
yeah that was lame
it's only gonna support up to 16 players
lameeee
24 is the new 16
well that's the same as Halo so it's not bad
actually, 32 is the new 24
like I said yesterday or whenever, I want a shooter that is much smaller scale than BF4
halo has those big maps with 32 players
me3
i don't view smaller match sizes to be a bad thing honestly
lol you want your actions to matter?
Anti-Planetside 2
seriously though
I like the faster pace of smaller shooters
lol
lol
ps2 is fast paced
but it also feels like a clusterfuck with no point
yep
lol
lol
the real concept of war
you're shooting a gun
but what does it matter
sodeep.org
3deep5me
lol
haha
are you two in the same room or somesuch jeeze
i feel like that would be a bad website to go to
lol
nope
XD
.org is safe .com is baaaaaaaaaaaaaaad
sodeep.org isn't a website
sodeep.com is a subsurface utility engineering company
>.>
uh huh
lol
lol
so yeah...don't know if want
imma wait
but keep an eye on it
because it does look good
is the beta even out yet?
no
Q4
oh
hmmm
yeah
i wouldnt buy it til its actually out
apparently they were planning on making Clan Admin Priveleges a purchasable extra feature (being able to host dedicated, host online LAN, and access Clan Admin Tools"
and then they were like "well wait just a minute"
"Sticking to our "NO BULLSHIT" policy, Clan Admin Privileges (CAP) are no longer planned as a purchasable extra feature."
I honestly expect UT to overshadow it
UT has a proven fanbase and established name
yeah
and will be on a better version of the same engine
I've never played Unreal Tournament
i never like UT
it was basically a genre defining shooter
just for the fact that it was too fast paced
lol
halo slowed it down a bit with shields
and that was nice
the new UT is moddable
but it was just too quick for me
and iirc open source
or semi open
nice
i kinda want to play an arena shooter now
lol
. . . BF4? does that count? lol
BF4 is about as far from arena shooter as it gets lol
yeah
lol
pretty far from it
either of you try firefall?
i've heard things
never really got on that bandwagon
huh
i've not
free
hmm
steam?
i think it's on steam yeah
...is it an mmo?!
yes
WHY WAS I NOT TOLD OF THIS
WHY
oh 62 rating hmmm
lol
what's youre recommendation?
meh
i've heard it was fun
it doesn't appeal to me
but i've never played
why do you need to mix mmo with shooter? lol
and dont feel like playing it honestly
w0t
whOt
because no one else has
well except WildStar
no one else has *successfully*
ok Firefall tl,dr: was good. sucks now. kthxbai.
99% of shooters, in my opinion, fall below the "meh" margin
I like Arma though
mmmm dem advanced ballistics and realistic physics models
so realistic that a twig can break your leg
Yes just like real life
you trip, break leg
However, if your T-55 tank falls off a cliff you are just fine
arma is just on such a terrible engine though :/
II or III?
both
They are on the same engine?
III is an update to the same engine
ah
Y U no make better game?
lol
I will write the story line for you
blargh
It will have nazis
i want to play tribes: ascend
but since i dont have it installed i will play bf4

Boop
"Great grandma died and I can't be there for her funeral. So here's a selfie with red lipstick in her honor." wat
maybe she liked red lipstick
maybe
The cleavage is a bit unnecessary though.
maybe great grandma liked boobs too
Maybe she was just her mom's mom and was a grandma who was great
maybe

oh boy, Chrome 64 bit was released as stable
now Chrome won't crash due to browsing too much reddit!
previously after browsing 32-36 pages worth of /r/all with RES, I would run out of memory and crash Chrome :(
lol
so my neighbor came over and of course Winnie was very curious
so he asks
"what kinda dog is that?"
"...staffordshire terrier"
"Uhhhhh-huh. Shoulda known."
Django was good.
t'was
for those who don't know, my dog is a Pit Bull. Everyone knows it. They ask a stupid question and they get a technically correct stupid answer.
ah lol
I like dogs. Turtles are ok too, though dinner takes a while when this chef is on the case http://i.imgur.com/osGKwl5.jpg
"oh my, what species of vicious killer is that?" "she's an english teacup of happiness." "aha. yes. quite."
so. about that boozlefissle foire

yus

trying to kill people in dark souls pvp
not going so well
some people have no honor
lol
i discovered that NZXT sells a liquid cooling gpu mount
i kinda want to do it but I also don't want to end up spending $250 on unneeded cooling
that does seem unnecessary
well for a GPU it can add like 5+ fps and drop your temps a lot
thus making the card last longer
the mount itself is $25
but i think i want to liquid cool my cpu at least so that it is quieter
and i don't want a giant brick of a heatsink for a traditional fan cooler
oh, also
apparently Dr Harris wants people to redo that system they have where you upload code and it compiles/tests it
he has two students on it and one of them asked me if I'd like to help
as our senior project
huh
nice
it was pretty cool
but it'd be a lot of compilerish work probably
If I can convince them to not use PHP then I will probably do it
unless you did the webside
lol
it wouldn't be that bad
and it'd be more interesting imo than the drone idea
true
wat doin?
voyager
eww
bootle fold fire
So I keep getting a blue screen from running steams new update
It appears to be fixed now
guys i beat dark souls 2

dark souls is fun
also i have a full five dollars in steam wallet from selling cards
A full five?
yep
5.02
i thought it was impressive
For cards yeah
Dude...
That's kinda like going back to SvM and realizing nobody plays anymore :<
well there's the new halo bundle on xbone

Ok so I'm about to ask my Guild a technical question.
I'm hoping for an actual answer.
But I'm betting for a circle-jerky tongue-in-cheek answer.
If I get the latter, I'm screenshotting this and posting it up.
(hi tony's guild)
can't make that home depot trip without some knowledge
oh my god it's like bait

The hell did I just read folks?
Lots of odd messages today Doctors

lol
Happy birthday D:
:D*
ugh
one of my professors is going to be difficult about me missing class for the WT/Delain concerts
new prof?
I happen to have two classes of his on thursdays
the other professor is cool and won't care
buh
no early assignment? Is he at least sorta competent?
one of the days is group meetings
(the two classes are software engineering [senior projects] and human computer interaction [gui's and stuff])
is it going to be a significant miss?
no
but he may not excuse it
is that horribad?
or maybe he'll be nice
if he doesn't excuse it I could lose some participation points
participation is like 4% of your grade
ah..
4%
wow
Actually
That's not bad
I had a prof where it was 15%
he said that if you don't participate at all he can drop you a letter grade
so 4% is arbitrary
and a lie
Ah
So he's just a jerk
lol
he tries to make it be like the real world
"real world"
"Do what I want or else"
that guy again? Have you had taht guy before?
new guy
Also for those who play wer thunder
i told him that the dates are set and people have paid for stuff and bought flights, etc
and that it is for my b'day
lol
so maybe he'll be nice
"Unless you reimburse us all and buy me a gift, fuck yo 4%."
lol
Is he American?
it's been 7 years since WT has done a concert on the west coast
lol
he's like... ukranian
Oh
so anyways
Slav-a-slava-vichian?
He's just mad about his country.
it happens with or without his blessing lol
lol
They are not known about of being a kind people
so weird to hear similar songs
"Horn of Plenty" from Hunger Games Catching fire
sounds like a rip from "Mystica" by Epica
Sounds sounding like rips offs is really common
lol I hummed Requiem for a Dream for one of Nao's songs and I think he thinks I ruined it lol
Have fun
ooooh
woo he said it's okay as long as I don't miss any other classes
woo
"That makes sense, doesn't it?! One or two bands from Netherlands! Who would miss that, no matter what?!
I'm joking, of course, but I appreciate your honest answer here, as it is, I do ..."
lol
Awesome.
good source for free pdfs of textbooks
brandon y u no link that earlier
it has the book i had to order on amazon
lol
apparently i can still return that book until 26 minutes from now
if this dl works and has the whole thing i am so doing that
frees up 50 bucks
lol
the book i tried to dl was 99% probably a virus
so
may or may not work
this one got to 2.8mb and failed
er
help me try these dls so i can cancel my order if they work
oh yeah the link i just pasted is right
it's one of the comments
maybe try this
you think a 25kb ebook is big enough? lol
no
lol
7.1mb seems right
Oct. 7 is the premier of The Flash :D
sweet
wtf why is this only 56 pages
it's 56 correct pages
lol
but it's missing like 2/3 of the book
same thing with the next one i tried
that's disappointing
tell amazon you only need to buy 2/3 of the book
lol
i'm sure they'll go for that
it has the first 24 pages, then starts skipping nine pages ahead
the book is normally only like 250 pages
sosad
it's probably just a rehost of a freely available preview
yeah
i figured that's what it was, i saw something similar the first time i looked
which was a few days ago
anywho
bed
night
yes
bed
good day doctor
*Waves fist in air*
school :F
meh
lol
i have a quiz today in my linear algebra class
on the second day of this class
they don't waste time there
yeah last semester i had a prof who gave a quiz on the first day
lol
Nothing like jump starting those nerves
lol it was supposedly all "review"
it was teh worst grade i got on a quiz all year lol
anywho, off to class
cya

design me some sprites for my game design class
lol
watcha want
inspired by 17th century aristocrats in a satirical fashion
eww
that was gross
i'll just delete that
lol
I think I asked, have you seen Hellsing abridged?
but anyway, if, by some random chance you're not 100% busy near mid/end semester, i may ask for some help/consulting on sprites for a game project since we're gonna be graded on art as well as gameplay and stuff and i'm horribad at art
lol
hellsing abridged
i don't think so
yeah absolutely
ah, well I haven't seen the actual anime
this is condensed with all the good parts and dubbed
looked it up, definitely havent seen
I lol'd, but there's a part relevant to your joke
looks good though?
oh it's great
nice
i may check it out then :P
"You stand accused of rape, murder, arson, assault, and desecration of corpses. What do you have to say for yourself?!"
"...........The aristocrats."
lol
they put it more eloquently of course but yeah
they release one episode every halloween
orly
interesting
probably their best work
yeah
they also did Yu Gi Oh! and DBZ
I've seen parts of the DBZ one
i'm like halfway through the first DBZ saga for nostalgia's sake
some of it is dumb humor but it's well written
lol
havent watched in a week or so though
oh hey
its entirety
nice
k, afk for a bit, need to focus and actually do hw since i'm going to california for the weekend

attend event without peeps or do BF4
bf4 for sure
too easy
may still go lol
I said I would last time
pshh who cares about commitments
bf4 all the way
my general thing is: will it a. not affect anyone i care about, b. affect someone i kind of know a little bit but not really, or c. affect someone that actually cares if i do said thing
if not a or b, then go
b is kinda iffy
but yeah, as long as nobody really cares if i go to something or not, then i usually dont
lol
eh, I said I would
it's networking for designers
i'll stick to my word

well possibility of moolah is never bad

How to succeed at best buy: Don't go to best buy, go to Fry's and make them match newegg's price.
Fry's is so far though
Not for me :P
frys is fucking far
nao
do I need to install the Netgear genie?

You need to open all your ports and enable remote control on your PC

I got my bottles today
I am going to bottle my own Ironport soda
why bottle your own soda?
It doesn't exist otherwise, this flavour of soda that is
but are you not just going to drink it?
I want to bottle it so I can take it with me
and store it
you should ship it to me, so i can taste test it
Or you can have some when you come down
Welp, just finished rewatching Voyager
brittle fiddle floor?
legit
what is it
Ironport Soda
I also had Ricardos for dinner
YOU

brandon and I used to try to edit the html to send them special messages
wut
Like what?
And
Why?
like "tell us a joke" and because it was fun/funny
I see
Did you buy that joystick per chance?
yep, should be here by the third
Oh cool
Are you ready to simulator?
very
Are you ready to crash on take off 30 times first?
nah, i've got takeoff down
i was thinking we should definitely should do some custom battles first to get the hang of it
also i still need to unlock jets :P
What country are you closest with?
usa i'm researching the panther f2
Hard mode
right away
yeah, otherwise i have to buy and research the p80
the f2 was much better price+research/time
plus it has a +100% research bonus so it'd research the p80 faster than any other plane (except maybe my 17g)
I do like the F9F
just not what it faces
Dem meteor mk.4s
They are: Faster, turn tighter, have faster firing more accurate cannons of the same calibur.
Oh and jesus climb rate
They ascend to heavan like its the 3rd day after Easter.
loll
However, you won't blow your wings off if you go over 3.5g's in a turn
You have that going for you
that is nice
Yes it is
nonsense
wut
the game
was nonsense
war thunder
it was nonsense

So around 4 pm I get a call from microsoft, apparently I've got an issue with my computer.
?
I don't... who would fall for this?
lol
"I run mac
old people
Since when does microsoft call a home user about a problem
"That's the problem sir!"
haha
"Yes hello? Can you hear me. I'm a technician from microsoft"
Me: No you're not... click*
lol
lol
"Oh my god, Steve Jobs?!"
shoulda messed with them
it's the 4th time this year
Lol I did with the first 2
"I SPENT TWELVE ******* HOURS WAITING ON TECH SUPPORT. I DEMAND TO TALK TO YOUR MANAGER"
lol
first one. "but I'm a mac user"
hahaha
LEL
hmm i've got to remember that one lol
And if I speak dutch with them they hang up instantly
"Hallo vs Hello" :P
you could just play along and reverse scam them
"What a coincidence, I work at microsoft too!"
be like "ah yeah it's been having issues. If I could just get your social security number I'll ship it over to you ASAP"
hahaha
I did play along once up until they asked for me to download their remote access software.
lol
oh yeah lemonparty right?
Took me a while to cycle that up so I used the meatspin software booster
I was like you can't seriously believe I'd fall for this. Why would mcrosoft use an external program while windows comes with remote access software.
lol
lol
They'd have to do better than that to scam me :P
install it on a VM and pull up the web cam. wear a ski mask and tell them you know where they live and that you are coming for them.
then terminate the vm
hahahaha
lol
so, star citizen is free to try until sept 5 apparently
WHAT

afk lunch
. . .hmmm
See I really want to be a spess pirate but i imagine you ahve to be insanely good at combat
lol
probably
or just outnumber the other person
what if it's a fleet?
then don't pirate a fleet
Maybe start with fast-attack ships and single out one ship
blow it bits
run away
you don't pirate fleets though
get others to chase
true
you pirate lone vessels

ian
flight stick
it is here
but it no recognize
wuttttt
Mine found it right away
also simulator battles has been set to axis v. allies
interestting
did you get it to work?
yeah its not working, war thunder isnt picking it up and their driver installer isnt recognizing it as connected
just try setting the controlls up from war thunder?
i did, it didnt recognize when i pressed buttons or moved axes
it makes the sound that it recognized it is there
windows does that is
but it doesnt try to install any drivers or anythign
download them directly?
they didnt have that option
lol
From their website?
yeah their installer wouldnt detect my device
contact their support?
mad catz support is sooo bad :F
i'll keep trying
this does suck though
they're just gonna tell me to update windows, which i cannot do
wut
why?
not a legit copy of windows :P saved money on the pc build
oh
What
is the plan then?
i'm trying to figure out what is going on when i plug it in
because it is being recognized, but it isnt being recognized
if that makes sense
the "buh duh" noise plays
but nothing else happens
Ian keeps whispering to me to give him my money :(
Gimme yo money
No
Yes
or we invade Canada
hey

h'okay in mumble
Howdy
Greetings fellow doctor
Greetings
How was your wednesday?
It was fine
What did you do?
school
3 fun 5 me
oodles
:FFFFF
i need food
hnnnnnng
Make some bacon wrapped bacon rings
should i make sphagetti or soup?
it'll be sphagetti with improvised meat balls
aka pepperonis
because I have a bunch
Pepperonis is actually italian for bellpeppers
pepperoni is good
you should take breadcrumbs and cut up the pepperoni, and combine the two with some egg and butter (for binding) and roll them into balls
then you have meatballs
that sounds either wonderful or terrible
i bet it would be delicious
in fact, i guarantee it
I wouldn't trust the blended taquitos club for cooking suggestions
hey now
those are good
you need to try it before you judge it
did someone say blended taquitos?!
Its like taking double processed food and processing it one more time anyway
I'll have you know I mentioned that to my co-workers at Originate and they all thought it sounded reasonable!
uh huh
you gotta try it
also I want ricardos
I had Ricardos on Saturday
i want ricardos x 100
or 1000
cant decide which
probably 1000
but really though, blended taquitos. even if you took a fresh, scratch made taquito from a real mexican, and blended it, it would instantly make it better, especially when you add salsa
it's like making chip dip
Or, I could simply make guacamole
or bean dip
or salsa
but none of those are the same
this is a meat based dip
what better substance to dip a taquito in to than a taquito?
[7:09:46 PM] Brandon Worl: this is a meat based dip
I found your problem
yes
yum
what's wrong with that?
we have meat sauce and broth
The only acceptable "meat dip" is chili
exactly
its literally a form of chili
You guys are just crazy
depending on the composition of your taquito, you could have beans, cheese, beef or chicken or steak, tortilla (not unlike adding fritos to taco soup), and when you add salsa it adds jalapeno, tomato, seasonings, onion, cilantro, the possibilities are endless!
It sounds disgusting/10
how does that sound disgusting?
also at least he said it's only one tenth disgusting. we're making progress
It sounds beyond processed
nah
it's just shreaded up a bit more
it's not like we make it so blended that it becomes runny
i don't understand how you can say it sounds beyond processed
there is literally no processing in the scenario i just gave
unless you call blending processing
then there is one stage
no response - clearly we have prevailed, andrew
No
I was getting my enchiladas ready
lol
I am going to go eat
lol
blend one and dradle it over the other!
And yes, blending a processes food is processing it one more time
dradle isnt the right word is it
ladel?
I SMELL JEW
ladle
there we go
Dradle your food or you'll nevurh become a lawwya
but how is it a processed food in teh first place?
its made from scratch
You make them, from scratch.... and blend them up?
yes
Why would you ever do that?
or
you take the ingredients of a taquito (literally the same exact thing as using a made taquito) and blend them instead
same result
bleh
anyways
either way, it tastes good
Dinner
lol
bbl
ian is going to eat blended taquitos for dinner to see what the fuss is all about :P
we'll secretly blend some taquitos and invite ian to a bbq or something
and offer it to him
he'll eat it without knowing and say it's good
ew
^
He agrees
Mez when I make smokes ribs you can have some
and they can have their taquitos
So
I really like the game Victoria II
Here is one of the top reviews
"evil white man's privilege simulator "
That's it
so that's two yum's and two ew's
we need to do a taste testing to settle
bf4?
bff?
You guys have seen Battlefield Friends, right?
So I am 99% sure slavs are the worst people
even worse then jews
well that was less exciting than I expected
they finally said "You know nothing Jon Snow"
but it was like not even significant
lol it never is
there has been plenty in GoT so far that was far more exciting than I expected though
like several characters I thought were still alive in the current season dying
lol
just you wait
I'm almost done with season 2
wow
so binge
lol
well each season is only 10 episodes
yeah, which is 10hrs/season
I watched 1/3 of it yesterdayn another 1/3 today
3 hours per day isn't binge
nah, that's just efficient watching
binge would be the entire show in 3 days
or all eight seasons of HIMYM in a month, with two seasons done in one night
that was a bit excessive
lol
lol
spoilers. spoilers everywhere
i need to finish the rest of these episodes
before I started watching I was ignorant enough for 99% of these spoilers to mean nothing to me
also I keep finding granola in my carpet
Destiny looks cool and I want the Halo bundle :(
why must they be xbone exclusive
because marketing
vghy
vgh*
vgh
belated
vgh
It's always a tense moment when I drop the price bomb.
I can hear the record scratch from miles away.
"Just for the logo? What do you include in the $$$$ the draw? "
*sigh*
Maybe you need a detailed invoice, or free advertising space witha discount
vvd
no not a detailed invoice. It's basically logo = $
still anything over $100 seems to scare people
"What do you mean I have to pay 2 tanks of gas for a well designed image that's going to be the face of my company?!"
o:
And if you deliver a cheaply made image they are going to complain aswell
:/
yup
Grabs bat (with docs logo)..., Shall we have a talk with these folks?
lol
I kid lol
Yes Huros.... help them find their wallets. >:)
haha
Help them find their $300 Louis Vuttion wallet
Be careful not to break their $600 watch.
With their platinum card.
And not step on their $600 shoes.
I don't think I've ever had 600$ shoes
destiny isnt xbone exclusive
nope
i've never even seen 600$ shoes
but it's not on PC is it?
no
ok sorry $300
just ps3/4 and xbone/360
pft
i've still never seen 300$ shoes
lol
they exist
unless you count signed vlade divac shoes, then i have seen them
ooh
nuts
are those literally made of panda or something?
why 10000 dollars
lol
lol
I can't stand what Louix Vutton stands for
I've been to St.Moritz.. cup of coffee plain is already a fortune, shopping there is unaffordable
Could spend the entire vacation budget on 1 hankerchief
"Can you reduce your price a couple of hundred dlls . Since I am thinking to do a lot of publicity and of course it will be with you?"
An excerpt of my response: "you'd like to be able to use your logo free and clear on every one of your publications, wouldn't you?"
God I shouldn't get so offended :I ignorance is not arrogance
Do you have a base/consultation fee?
nope
These buggers are trying to rob you
Verbal contracts aren't worth the paper they're written on.
battlefield china rising if you'd like to join btw
still playin tony?
no but more would not hurt my feelings
i'm down
i'm down
im hoppin on :P
i'll join after i grab a snack
lel "busienss card proposal"
From reddit:
I hole-hardedly agree, but allow me to play doubles advocate here for a moment. For all intensive purposes I think you are wrong. In an age where false morals are a diamond dozen, true virtues are a blessing in the skies. We often put our false morality on a petal stool like a bunch of pre-Madonnas, but you all seem to be taking something very valuable for granite. So I ask of you to mustard up all the strength you can because it is a doggy dog world out there. Although there is some merit to what you are saying it seems like you have a huge ship on your shoulder. In your argument you seem to throw everything in but the kids Nsync, and even though you are having a feel day with this I am here to bring you back into reality. I have a sick sense when it comes to these types of things. It is almost spooky, because I cannot turn a blonde eye to these glaring flaws in your rhetoric. I have zero taller ants when it comes to people spouting out hate in the name of moral righteousness. You just need to remember what comes around is all around, and when supply and command fails you will be the first to go. Make my words, when you get down to brass stacks it doesn't take rocket appliances to get two birds stoned at once. It's clear who makes the pants in this relationship, and sometimes you just have to swallow your prize and accept the facts. You might have to come to this conclusion through denial and error but I swear on my mother's mating name that when you put the petal to the medal you will pass with flying carpets like it’s a peach of cake.
Most nails on a chalkboard comment ever
Oh my god the malapropism atomic bomb
Exactly
"zero taller ants"
Two birds stoned at once.
uhhhghhhghhghghghghghhghhhnnnnnn
Its painful
Happy Valentimes day. I got you some Numchucks with Woofs on them.
I am the earl of y
and my tire brand is d
why u up
Sketchy people are sketch
"The name is herpaderp LLC, I am working on getting a number, website, location, and licenses."
hours later: "Yes the LLC is registered"
lol
i had to take alex to work
oh
also i'm playing bf4 if you want to join
lol ummm lemme finish up this contract real quick
I'm just gonna stick her name in it since there's no LLC
onm umble if peeps are joining
soon D: sorry
oh you
you're fine
lol
brandon just hopped on origin (or so it said) so i figured i'd leave that in chat :P
lol
SE devs are doing an AMA in 26 minutes
I want to ask them a few questions when that goes up
like what
If they plan on fixing those stuttering issues/general usability improvements
What their plan is for the game world (i.e. if they will add planets, procedural generating, etc)
status of programming blocks
multiplayer docking
that would be nice wouldnt it? :p
as fun as multiplayer docksploding is
lol
ok may be able to squeeze a match in
lol
Motherfuckers
"My business name is called A CO. I'm changing it to B CO." She wants a logo for B Co.
wut
client
wants logo for B
B doesn't exist yet
B is happening
A exists
interesting
what's wrong with that?
Hypothetically
kinda what i was wondering as well
lol
if B doesn't happen
as in
if B doesn't get registered
then I'll have made a logo for a fictitious company
what do you care if you get paid?
Since the company doesn't exist, it can't really owe me money.
if you say pay me to make this, you are owed money
^
the contract should reflect that this "she" owes you the money, not the company that may or may not exist in the future
That's what I sent her
no word yet on whether she's signing it
gotcha
well
if she doesnt and can't come up with a reasonable compromise then nope.jpg
yeah
figuring that one out
also
biz faz fizzo?
i can for like an hour
im on mumble
im trying to beat this stoopid tower defense game :l
lol
stahp and play bf4 til i have to go :P
tony get onnnn
tonyyyyy
get onnnnnn
goshhhhhhh
Look
at that
wow
I am building a server

oh good
lol
want a link to the client?
well
I am building the client
give me a bit
lol
i cant play now anyway
but that is awesome
Well I am still going to build the client
well good
well
very well
much indeed well
why the hell is there two sets of voices in that video :l
dunno
but its super cool looking
It looks like as long as you only have a few people it works quite well
bruh
bad news
ksp multiplayer keeps crashing
ooooohkay there
I know this guy was joking
but
...can one be a grammar nazi about code?
html and css?
"I need help with HTML and CSS"
"<bold>LOL !</bold> (Sorry, I had to do it)  If you're on a mac, I would suggest using CyberDuck."
translates into "i have no idea what i'm doing"
pretty sure grammar nazis in code is equal to every programmer who has a style and gives a damn about what is being done
lol
so, most programmers
also programming languages are languages
and all languages have grammar
and all regular languages have regular grammar
speaking of which
did you look at the hw yet?
nope
He said the answer to #1 in class
but I dont remember it
"Why are the front end and the back end of a compiler usually implemented as 
separate passes? "
the front end is language specific, back end is independent of language (other than machine differences)
i thought that might be it, but I wasn't sure :p
lol yeah
i think i wrote it down
maybe
some of these problems seem difficult
orly
like #4
idk wtf #4
lol
brb like 10mins
actually #4 can only possibly be solved one way, I just dont know what "ATOM" means or stands for
so that was literally the worst traffic i have ever been in
the football game crowd was just leaving and i had to take alex to riley's place
for some reason Virginia always has TERRIBLE traffic while I am leaving campus
took literally 25 minutes to get there, and another 10-15 to get back using the fucking freeway because it was about 2x as fast
you leave between 3 and 5?
yes
so does everyone else with a car
lol
lol
surely i've left in that time frame previous semesters though
it takes me 8-10 minutes to get from the parking garage to McCarran
yeah that was normal for me when i had to leave then from the garage
lol
it's never been this bad for me before
there are a lot of students during the beginning of the semester, give it time and it'll dwindle down to the few that actually attend class
that's what I'm hoping
want to do this programming languages hw together tomorrow?
yeah, sometime between 4 and 10pm work? that's when alex works
sure
cool
i think most of it won't be bad
other than that i'll be hanging with my dad for the morning, he's coming to trade cars with me
I know the answers to 1, 2, and 4
i got 1, 2, 3
i think anyway
havent looked at 3 yet
the grammars for languages and vice versa are ezpz for me

power supply fans go on the bottom?
nao, pic of your machine?
power supply fans face outward, wouldnt really make sense to have them facing the ground
ok I saw some comments in PCMR about a build and was a bit confused
there are no vents on the bottom of my case anyway so it'd cause a heat trap
no bueno
lol
yeah
fellas wanna play some bf4? i'm on but cant talk, alex is sleeping :F
hmng

woo homework assignment finished 11 days before the due date! a first!
woo
bluh
that probably is a first
lol
did you look at the e.c.
?
Yes
I did it
oh nice
not too bad?
It was easy
was it just the a^odd b^sameodd or was there another one?
Yeah, just that
{a^n b^n | n > 0 and n is odd}
gotcha
well, off to bed
night
Night
yeah i'm tired
lol http://i.imgur.com/l7aWcEX.png
oh wow lol
loool
wow
that is great
hey brandog
hi
hi
hi
do you want to go to winco later?
sure
i went yesterday but i forgot to get plastic wrap and i need more juice
gotcha
also
we have cheese biscuits from red lobster
in mix form
like
pancakes
but cheesy biscuits
that sounds amazing
it does
we have a big box from costco
Make flat bread out of it
and buy some crawdad meat
and make like
lobster rolls
or make one giant glob of bread
and eat it
bleh
androo
hi
when were you thinking of wincoing?
sometime in the next two hours probably
ok
i want to get some hw done first
np
brandoge
S -> aaSbb | ab
also winco soon?
sure
also i dont think that works
porque no?
actually maybe it does
oh
no
it doesnt
it can't make aaaabbbb
or can it
it can
neither can the language
but that isnt in the language
n would be even
yeah
so, it doesn't work
or does it
lol
i think it does
it might
it can do 1, 3, 5, 7, etc
any odd number of a's and b's
yeah
and its the same number of a's and bs
lgtm shipit
wut
lol
lol
that's git talk
lol
looks good to me - ship it
i don't have git translator
ah
gotcha
lol
what did you do?
um
i did
S -> aAb A -> aaAB | e B -> bb
i'm pretty sure that literally reduces to what i did
well
kind of
you did it outside in
I think I was doing a different form of grammar
actually nvm, because I was still breaking a rule for the more restricted one
lol
imma double read the question and make sure i didnt do the wrong grammar
we've only learned the one grammar
no i mean the question might have been asking something different than what i thought
lol
Mine is in like 1/2 chomsky normal form
ah
that sounds
interesting
lol
lol
alex is talking to her dog on the phone...
"i love you reesie i miss you! reese! reese! hi reese!"
...
meanwhile
"yes, this is dog"
lol
dearie me
my solution seems way too easy for a 10 point e.c. problem
lol
it does
it did take me a bit to think of
that's why I was skeptical
I just defaulted to a stack
but once i was like "okay so i need an even number plus an odd terminal"
because that's the usual solution
it was pretty simple
queso
winco
oh i forgot to tell you
mine is actually just one step away from being in CNF
i won 50 bucks last night
not that that matters
how? lol
lol
blackjack
i used 10 bucks of my money and 40 my dad gave me, and played blackjack at my parents casino they were staying at with my dad
he lost 5 bucks at the end of like 2 hours
i was killing it, had 3 21's, and ended 50 bucks richer
so i gave him the winnings and kept the 40 he gave me
lol
lol
it was pretty damn fun
idk what type of grammar he wants
and i only went up/down 5 bucks at a time, so it would have lasted a long time even if i lost everything, so i'd be able to get free drinks worth how much i'd lost anyway
because neither of our solutions are regular grammars
a left regular grammar is what we were doing
no
we have terminals on either side of nonterminals
which isn't regular
oh
right
hmm
that would be an unfortunate misunderstanding
yeah
Write a grammar that describes
just a grammar
not regular
so we have an argument point at least
lol
yeah, everywhere on the sheet says just grammar
not regular
maybe he means context free grammar
because that's what we have
that's what i have in my notes
and its what we've gone over mostly in class
so if we did that right, then i'm gonna call it good
lol
lol
so
winco now?
sure
oquay
you comin over soon neighbor?
i can come over whenever
should i come over now?
yes
lol
sorry

i networked andrew's printer before
what kind of printer is it?
HP
I think his was an Epson? maybe
or maybe not
idk
HP LaserJet Professional P1102w
should be as easy as doing the add printer wizard, no?
yeah but I've changed the router
maybe i need to uninstall and all that
probably
yeah fix'd
watdo

Show the memory cycle timing waveforms for the write and read operations. Assume a CPU clock of 150 MHz and a 
memory cycle time of 20 ns similar to that shown in Fig. 7.4 (see Mano-Ch7.pdf).
when the fuck did we get iced cream?
so I need to choose 3 videos that show some form of human/computer interaction and write a short blurb aout each
as in AI interaction or computer?
show the video of the dude using the oculus rift roller coaster freakout
i have found two but they are both var related so now I need 1 more
can't do that
damn
I'm assuming that's on the list of ones he's seen before
even if it isn't then everyone will do that
how about some form of alternative control system
like eye tracking or something
or you could do something with steam's big picture mode and how it works better with a controller
that's kinda cool
that's new
that is cool
who does it work
*how
how the hell did the w get all the way over there
interesting
seems legit
"iOS" :<
Android has Shield though
so iOS can suck it
^
oh lol I didn't even know about that
seriously who uploads their course syllabus as a powerpoint
who uploads questions that nobody in their right mind would know?
there are four questions on this hw that are basically just egbert showing off how much he knows about memory and embedded systems
so he's the Nathaniel Hawthorne of teaching
nah, he doesnt do it on purpose
he just doesnt know how to make homework assignments
guaranteed take it to the bank
gttb
indeed
welp, finished that assignment
i can procrastinate the next one till tomorrow
i find it difficult to concentrate when my textbooks folder is right next to my games folder
i can probably keep this LA assignment til tomorrow as well
i'm 2/3 done with it already
the answer is
[0 1]
[1 0]

so according to the Dutch
Destiny on PC in March 17 
do they have a source on that?
krispy creme donut ice cream sandwich http://i.imgur.com/gQn7NtB.jpg x_x i want it
would be better with a blended taquito though
ew
did you see the promo vid for the last BF4 DLC?
no
Hangar 21 looks awesome
also apparently there's a bipod knife
lel?
and a bow as well apparently
lol of course
there's a ton of BF  references in the DLC
hm
link?
Whiteout looks fun
oh my god
yeah Hangar 21 ftw
lol
hover tank, mechs, some new futuristic rifle
lol oh dear
video of whiteout, rail gun, flying death robot, and hover tanks: <derp>
derp wrong link
so
apparently starcraft 2 is free
nope.com
will get addicted and/or owned by koreans
lol
just owned by koreans
it's fun to play with friends though
._.
it has cool mods and stuff
like a team of 4 of us can work together to defend an area from bots
or play bejewled starcraft 2 edition
(I am undefeated)
lol
(at the bejeweled one. i suck at the actual game)
I'm decent at RTSs but I don't own
i logged in to my Battle.net account for the first time in like 3 years, so it locked it due to unusual account activity x_x
where does one get this free starcraft 2?
nvm
also i figured out my problem with battle.net and my security question not being a security question i actually set up
lol
battle.net
what is
blizzard's authentication and stuff
oh for starcraft hah
yeah
and wow and hearthstone and all other blizzard thingies
wow
lol
both very popular games
interesting
i'm going to make "population of orthogonal planes", a new math simulator game.
PoOP
PoOP, now with triangles
triangles in poop!? whatever will they think of next?
we need 4 sc players for a full game (1v1 gets boring eventually)
lol
i'm down buuuut...uhhh
butuhhhh
who's 4?
ment is!
lol
I'll just leave this here http://i.imgur.com/Ai285x4.jpg *creeps away
lol wut
it's not toast nailed to a wall but it's close enough
that's one toasty shower
anywho, i'm pretty sure ian like strategy games
so maybe he'll play lol
or m31
toast in shower
ok
i also downloaded hearthstone
figured i'd try it out
let me know how that is
been debating that
i like it
??
it's fun
i'm still in the tutorial but it is very fun
cool game mechanics
hmmmm
interesting
looks kinda cool
greetings
grotongz
greenthings
._.
-.-
hearthstone is fun
also i am hungry
i just drank a big strawberry frap
when you wanna go to tel daco?
either soon or in a few hours
i'm good with either, i can eat a biscuit or we could go very soon because i starve
im not souper hungry
oquay, i'll have myself a biscuit
i'll write my paper
Tel Deco what?
Tel Daco Tuesday
Ian: Tuesday.
no no no Daco
That's Ian's mexican cousin in law
lol
I thought that would be El Deco
you don't level up in Hearthfire do you?
dunno
never tried it
isnt it basically blizzard's answer to LoL/Dota?
Andrew has
er....kinda?
that was my understanding of it at least
you do level
specifically in each class you use
fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck
so if you use the mage, that's a level
lol
why
Hate levelling
its not so much levelling as it is getting cards for playing
are the cards stronger?
i think max level for each class is 10
with distinct advantages?
kinda
kinda levelling
but you dont have to play much to level
i'm almost level 10 with the mage, and i've done 6 matches
I don't want another Warthunder shindig where I'm far below in levels and get to play ketchup
also on an unrelated note: the new BF4 DLC maps are playable for today, tomorrow, and the next day
one map per day
Whiteout is today's
not for us though, right?
for everyone
only for CTE or whatever
CTE is an opt-in thing
we can opt in
oh
well then
whiteout looked weird
Hangar 21 looks awesome
indeed it does
i hate their derpy snow glare mechanic
well it's probably pretty realistic
probably
but realistic is for noobs
lol
I leave in 1.5hrs
CTE says I don't own BF4
......
WELP
wat
why does it log in to Naosyth2
x_x
wat
I own crysis 3?
yeah
humble origin bundle
i though that was 2
maybeeee
idk
lol
woo i got it
I have CTE enabled now
what is cte
community test environment
you need it to play the new DLC maps?
you need to opt in to it to test the new maps
the DLC isn't released
ah
I have 2 pages typed here, why is it only 550 words :(
big words
I thought 2 pages was supposed to be 1000 words
if you do it right
lol
single spaced
1in margins
not an excessively big title zone
etc
i did double spaced
do politician style
then two pages double spaced would be one page single spaced and thus the 550 words
what's the topic?
basically i propose an idea for an interesting senior project topic
but not the idea i'm actually going to do
my idea is: an immersive computer environment
You see... senior projects are a great way for students to capitalize on everything they've learned with the past years of their education.
it's a chair with a dome around it
inside is a projector on the back of the hair
so it projects a slice of a virtual environment based on your chair's rotation
so the "desktop" wraps all around you
that sounds awesome
+ touch screen and vibration feedback
etc
mostly for gaming
^above was satirical
btw
but could also be for productivity
lol shift+tab = swivel
lol
could also be used for like flight simulation training
ok 777 words
that's good enough
goal was 600-1000
so do we want to play a game or summting
I'm almost done typing this
lol
hurreh
also destiny looks legitimately amazing
idk
i've heard many meh reviews
i'm watching a stream of it right now
and it seems like something i would love
people say it is very repetative
i like repetative
lol
and that it is only being oggled because Bungie made it
which wouldnt surprise me
neither would i
but
from firsthand watching
it looks good
Colin (from the lab) says it is amazing
#fanboy
i'm checking out the pvp part of it now
because that's the part i havent seen
i think the best part is all the coop focus
I'll still hold out for a PC release
oh yeah, me too
yay finished my paper
yay
we should tel daco
downloading cte right now
i'm down
but
let's do it
what are we telling him?
tell him 6 tacos pl0x
lol
ok
who drive
it is indeed downloaded
LETS DO THIS
actually people are doing bf4
we may just want to do that
lol
but this map is today only!
i knowwww
okay
we do this
then we do that?
i only have 1.5 hours
yes
the web plugin wont work :l
yeah
me either
y it so
idk
well
i guess no cte 5 us
yep
i'm hopping on with nova and herpderp
we're all in mumble
I was just about to tell you guys at how amazing destiny looks
but maybe that magazine just did a damn fine job of hyping it the hell up
lol
I've seen people either giving it a meh or giving it an "AMAZING"
YO
for cards
I guess
You can sign in with your Microsoft account
because bungie
and redeem all dat
what are they for?
no idea
cards it says
AWW THE DOCTORS IS ALREADY TAKEN IN DESTINY
WTF
what do we do now
What did we do for Blacklist?
uhhhhh
dunno
NOS?
no
lol
we can be the Brain Surgeons
WELP
lol
THE DOCTORS
was taken
DOCTORS
was not
so there
that's better anyways
do you plan on getting destiny on console?
nope
PC
PC I can rock
lol
oh
the cards are just lore pieces
but the other codes are emblems you can unlock etc.
that snippet of javascript just returns undefined for me
uhhh
are you at the code redemption page?
also that's so weird
yes
mine worked
i fixed it
lol
woo i got the CTE to work
woo
today's map is hangar 21
brandog

i have to be there by 9 tomorrow for senior project meeting
lol
i'd have to get there at 8 to have a chance at finding a tutor lol
i *think* I have that
wait no i have the prototype
lol
it looks pretty interesting
probably not my thing
but interesting nonetheless
AR160 <3
i just need 1 more headshot with an assault rifle to unlock it outsiede of CTE :D
do you get everything in cte?
yeah
oh wow
that's nice
good for testing stuff

that's awesome
must i get cte?
not if you dont want it
andrew
Hearthfire still good?
hearthstone?
oooh
Ozone up 4% since 
i still enjoy it quite a lot
so yes
lolhearthfire
......hrm
skyrim
hrmmmmmmm
if you're going to play, it will require you to gain a knowledge of how each class works, and a decent knowledge of the cardbase. reddit suggests going through the tutorial, doing single player adventure and beating all the ai on both normal and expert (stop using a class once it's at level 10, at that point you have all its basic cards and there is no gain for using it against ai), and then going into the player battles while experimenting with decks, combos, etc until all the classes are level 10
the ultimate goal is to get good enough that you can win in the arena and sustain playing in it
so yeah
quite a learning curve
but it is fun
...hmmm
lol
can we select our opponents?
i believe there is a way to play against friends, if that's what you're asking
other than that its just matchmaking based on your record and cardbase
i think anyway
not sure how the matchmaking goes
hm
Andrew we need to play simulator battles again soon
i know, i havent really had a WHOLE lot of time outside of school and bf4 lol
but yeah, i want to work some more with dat joystick
just need minibreaks from WT :P

I'm sure the beeping drove my neighbors insane for a few minutes
lol

just imagine if your mom got ahold of this story, she'd freak
yes she would
which is why this story never leaves these digital walls!

no
no burning
shh

idk
nope
but he had a french bread pizza in the oven and like5ish minutes before it finished cooking he left his apartment and came with us to go to uswirl and then we kinda tried to hurry back so his apartment wasnt aflame
but the cash register stopped working
so we were heavily delayed
oh shit
and it practically melted all of my froyo
meanwhile it is beeping souper loudly indicating that the timer finished
clearly audible through walls
XD
#lolneighborswithdogsgg

and they coudlnt figure out how to get 2 objects to display
so
I still need to beat Andrew
they're asking this guy who i guess took the class already or was its ta or something for help
and then in the end, I found the solution

we're starting the smashing when you're ready to head over
my pizza is 70% eaten

As pizza's go
french bread pizza does
french bread pizza trumps all
i dunno, that tomato pizza was pretty good
its like the ace of spades in a game of horse race with spades as the trump suit
thats true, i liked that tomato-basil-balsamic combo stuff on top
local area connection has invalid ip address
wat
o.O
what gave you that error?
dunno
everytime irestart i have to reconfigure my interwebs
>.>
why
and I'm no longer connected to my wifi but to "network for"
which may just be the wired i dunno
if you have the wire hooked up then yeah that's probably it
you connect your desktop to wifi?
^
i don't
oh you just meant it doesnt show it as you're connected to, say for me/nao, the "doctors" network
that's normal
what do you mean by "everytime irestart i have to reconfigure my interwebs"
there's a connection error
taht i have to repair
at least, recently
after start ups
I wonder if it's because I start Steam with the computer now? IT's the only thing that's changed
doubtful
yeah i doubt it's steam
it could be something with your router-cable-computer setup, like maybe your router shuts off as well or isnt set up properly
or maybe you just have to update adobe reader
lol
lol oy
could be that I networked my printer to it
also doubtful
yeah i doubt it
wanna come play smash bros for like half an hour until i have to go to lab? jared and alex want to play and jared is leaving for the weekend to go to aftershock in a bit
yus -_-
nah, I'm cleaning and stuff
laaaame
tony's down
lol
what version is it again? Brawl?
half an hour isn't long
no but it means i have to change from my pajamas
lol
I think I just saw have good lunch guy in one of the unr maintenance trucks

brandonnnnn
o
rite
awkward
hawkward
sockward
too much?
too much
did you fix your phone yet?
ha no
i havent touched it since last night
you should take it to the apple store and just say "i dont know what's wrong"
hahahahaha
and hand them the pile of parts
"um idk what happened it just kinda did this"
"My iphone6 blew up" plz halp
you know my phone has free screen replacement offered by google
i think its too late for my phone
RIP Iphone 5
RIP in peaces
pieces...
spelling is hard
How'd you manage that? My phones usually last until they don't offer the services anymore
cracked screen and a slightly less than successful repair attempt
ah
haha if we had fishing wire it wouldve worked but i think i damamged the lcd with the screwdriver
looks like you need the D-Team
whats the D-Team
The A-Team but better
Doctors Team*
Hahahahahha
how did i not realize that
haha what were you thinking lol
the D
haha
well at least we know what brandons thinking about
I'm thinking about tacos
because I'm eating tacos
now i want tacos
damn you brandon
bring me some
i have extra shells and meat if you want some
I don't want to think about food :S
stew
stewie
bf4?
yes in a minute
or planetside mehbeh? Been wanting to try that out
i dont have it installed
but it was meh imo
lol
im on mumble
oh ok
you're quick
so that was a fucking waste of four hours of my life
Happy Friday
and wat?
did the entire ram circuit step by step, getting it checked by the TA every step of the way
(cpe lab)
And then?
only to have him tell me at the very fucking end that something was done wrong and i should start over entirely
four. hours.
of wiring a circuit
10/10 never wire again
i would love that option
but i need this class to graduate
so, barring another failure, i have to spend another fourish hours on sunday doing the same thing
and if that doesnt work, then i have to do it again sometime before wednesday
You can do it
probably
-_- fail TA
are we also sure that the TA is right?
yeah, he was right about needing to redo it
somehow one of my input lines was outputting voltage
which shouldnt be possible unless something is crossed, somewhere
and i pulled all the wires and made sure (for the second time) that all the chips were working
and they were
so at some point he said i was all good when something was actually wrong with the circuit
._. hm
ahh, i've had my coffee now and I feel great!

Dear Doctors,
I do require a new multiplayer game, do you have any suggestions that may suit my tastes?
Thank you,
Sir Decosun I, Esq.
PoE

^
I wish
lol
trains unlimited
hearthstone
hearthstone best stone
war trains
ooh
war trains
i should make that in my game design class
Brandon seems to be dead on with my tastes
lol
train manager ultimate
oh how about "The Jews, 1940: A Holocaust Simulator"
I don't think I actually own a game with manager in the title?
archeage is coming out soon
archeage is pay to win now though
also
brandoni
are you gonna come play?
haggling: The Game
uhhhhh
lol
maybeeeeeee
idkkkkkkkkk
[9:00:14 PM | Edited 9:00:26 PM] : archeage is pay to win now though
War Thunder pay to level fast style or pay for tier 10349341 gear?
i think it's pay for tier blah gear
but i didnt actually watch ziggy's video on it
all i know is ziggy is cool guy and when he stops playing because pay to win, it is probably pay to win
War Thunder is pay to ease Struggle, Komrade
yeah
lol
i have succumbed to the urges several times now
such strife
Premium makes warthunder 10% easier
i'll come play in a few moonits andrew
i am going to eat desert
oquay sounds goooooode
so i randomly became like super medic during my last 4 rounds of BF4 today
i was running all over the place reviving allies and dropping bad guys like flies
it was strange and unusual
from what i hear, they did nerf the pay-to-winness
that would be nice
the game showed promise til i heard that
also
brandonneeeeee
commmonnnnn :F
one cannot rush dessert
no but one can spoil smash bros!
(ooohhh burrnnnnn)
see
they're spoiling it
you can even
this actually looks really fun
wow, skyrim regular edition is five bucks this weekend
time for bethesda to release a new one i guess
well they did release a game recently
ESO
nobody likes ESO
lol
but really though, check out that game i linked
it looks fun
it may be the pc arena shooter type thing we've been looking for (and its 5 bucks)
For those who still need a strategy
lemme know if any of you want to play that because i have 5 bucks from marketing trading cards lol
you can market trading cards?
....that does look legit
i'm down if others are
same
selling all cards now kthx
lol
cool
i'll buy and dl, gonna take alex to work and then i'll hop on to play
mixture of reviews
yeah, i watched a few videos and it seemed worth five bucks at the very least
plus its basically free for me since TC's
so yeah
lol
aaand downloading
let us know
well, the crafting and stuff is cool
they have paid skins for weapons and characters, but no pay to win elements or premium xp boosts or anything like that
gonna play a match now
it has integrated voip
lol
well, one match of TDM down, pretty fun even just in that mode
gonna do titan mode now, that's their flagship game mode
overall pretty fun
i think it's worth 5 bucks
really fast paced gameplay
andrew, I'm making a quick winco run if you wanna come
nah, i'm good thanks. i dont think we need anything at the moment
anyone up for some bf4?
sure
i've just been grinding hearthstone lol
lemme get to a good spot in this episode to pause
lol
ok
dat episode
so long
:F
lol
2 more minutes
ok im in mumble
for mez mostly: http://imgur.com/gallery/gi7c9
^ Why I don't play most shooters
indeed
who likes induction proofs!?
cardboard??
lol thank you m31
yes
cardboard
teh future of 3d vr gaming
OR IS IT
it's the occulus thrift!
lol
kinda neat
seriously though, 3d shiz for 4 bucks
that's sick
thats weird
brandon, go look outside, it looks like the fucking nuclear apocolypse out there
us according to norway
lol
why is it so apocalypse outside?

o.o
uhhhhh
ok
so
ok Andrew how goes Minimum?
I got $1.28 from card sales :D
lol
oh my god
minimum is fun
I need to get this
i need peple to play with though
MOBA elements? FPS?
yeah
lol
dude we can have roles like in League
also brandon it is crazy fire bad
you could probably do that if you got that into it
lol
yus
one strategy is to feed someone
the weapons and upgrades and stuff are the moba part
get your buddy more kills
deny enemy team kills
get buddy op
op buddy carries you
yeah, that would definitely be an option
we could have medics that keep some op sword weilding fucker dancing around
those guys are annoying as shit
lol
how do you play? aggressive? defensive? strategy? berzerk?
i'm fairly aggressive, but i mostly just fit in where i'm needed
hm
player count per match?
i think 12 or something? not sure
lol
oh wow
huh
lemme wait a bit to see if I can get any more money from tc sales
is it a new fire or the same one?
no clue, but if you walk outside, i thought somebody was barbequen, and then i thought "oh lord jesus its a fierrrr"
lol yeah
smells like fire
looks like 2 fires
one north of us and one south
both in cali
nvm
whole world is on fire apparently
oh wow
lol
yeah, thats a lot of fire
also
10 per match
and definitely room for roles if you have the weapons and stuff crafted
i. am. hungreh.
and i want a burget
or chicken
or a chicken burger
i want canes
i have tomato pizza thing left over
lots still
if you want some
on my way
lol
lol
Canes
lol
Mez owes Brandon and I Canes
still
stillllllll
we don't even know for what
also the fires didn't get better it seems
I have done it! I have watched all 4 seasons of GoT
woo
I like how the desert seems to be the ONLY thing not on fire
lol
it's too dry for any possible fuel to grow here!
yeaaaaah
Daenerys is more badass than wii u
lol
so tony
how was live game escape?
fun actually
did you die?
yeah i died
lol seriously?
we died almost twice
seriously you get caught up in the stupidest thing
lol
live action you can't tell what's significant and what's not
(we bought an extension)
example
DVD said story about black birds and white birds with girl playing piano
something about 2nd blackbird
17th white bird etc
there's a keyboard
piano keys
clearly
and they're numbered
audio doesn't work
not plugged in
no batteries
we start looking for batteries
I notice the 2nd piano key is lifted up
I lift up another key
I break the key ._.
hahaha
we decide that that's not it
they told us it was a MENTAL game, not physical
finally I think, "oh, the numbers on the keys....4 digits....4 keys...4-digit combo lock right below"
that's when things click
you can NOT overthink those things
and we played the easiest
so next time
lol
we're gonna try the hardest one
record's like 1.5 hours
w/ 10 peeps
wow
i wanna come! :F
it's fun though
like so fun
Escape game
er
Live Game Escape
not Room escape
that's different than the one we were looking at before right?
yeah
Room escape is the one off the strip
Game Escape is the one off Jones and Sahara
how well decorated were the rooms? I heard the other one wasn't very well decorated
so you didn't really get very immersed
well
What is this game?
I don't want to say it's well decorated
This sounds interesting
but they have the details
like
sick bed
mattress
"ghost" in teh closet
mannequin in teh wheelchair
not decked-out though
i got the impression the other one was just a bare white room with some props
lol
because then, I'm sure you'd wonder, "what's significant? what isnt?"
essentially that's what this was
don't get me wrong I had a blast
but if there was a chandelier I'd pick that thing apart
lol
we spent 15 minutes on the keyboard
What is this?????
It sounds cool
someone please fill me in
I'd still love to see something like this but like full on details
like an environment as seen in amnesia
god that would be nuts
Ian
ever play those flash games where you woke up in a room alone with no hints and had to find your way out?
Live action version
put in room
see clues
follow clues
hopefully escape
oh god
there was one moment
"My only wish is to take a final picture with you under the sun."
we see a picture fragment
of course we're looking for the 2nd picture fragment
there is no 2nd picture fragment
also
"under the sun"
we look at every single lightsource
shine the flashlights and uv lights on the photo
nothing
This sounds fun
how much is it?
We're trying the maintenence serial numbers on the overhead fluorescent bulbs on teh lock combos
hahaha
we needed to shine the light on the BACK OF THE PHOTO
-_-
they took a selfie.....light source in front...gaaaaahhh
stupid things man, you can not overthink any of it
how much is it?
uhh
cheapest one was $20 with a discount
hardest one
that w'er etrying next
is $10
probably because there's a guaranteed time extenion ($4)
How long do you have to solve it?
easy one was 45min
hard was 1hr
I think we should do this
lol I'm down.
i'll be in vegas oct 2 - 5
^
you up for it Brandon
yes
also ricardos
someone should invent a silent washing machine
i'm down
1.64!
making dat money!
free game each monday all september
ooooh
good god
also
1.77
almost $3 for Minimum
>_>
How do I get a free game from humble bundle?
go to website
click thingy for free game
says "Get <GAME> free now!
I just got it
Receiver looks cool anyway
I'll take 2
saw on reddit this morning -.- noob reposters...
yeeeehhh
lol
saw it on reddit last night - gosh
oboy
actually it may have been this morning
time and reddit are basically black holes without perception
lol
oh right that's why I abolished this layout
fffffffffffffffffffffffuuuuuuuuuuuuu why
click on the pictures now though
some of the showcases have changed
lol
you can probably just hardcode the height of that div to hold all the images
it isn't an elegant solution but it would probably fix it
uhhh
that doesn't work either
o.o
are you sure you know how to hardcode
lol
ok display block works sorta
er, hardstlye sorta
X_X
hey real quack brandog, if i have a 2x2 matrix times a 2x1 matrix, say [0 2, 2 0] x [x y], how does that multiplication apply? is it [(0x + 2x) (2y + 0y)] or is it [0x + 2y, 2x + 0y]?
umm
lemme write that on paper
lol
keep in mind the dims are 2x2, 2x1
hard to tell with how i formatted the thingy
won't it be [2y, 2x]?
thats why i was asking you lol my brain decided to lose this easypeasy information
or is it 2x, 2y
lol
my instinct told me to calculate it as 2y, 2x but my logic tells me 2x, 2y
yes 2y 2x
do you apply the multiplication by column or by row?
so x times left top, left bottom, y times right top and bottom
or x times left and right top and y times left and right bottom
0x + 2y
2x + 0y
you go across the rows of matrix a and down the cols of matrix b
ok
so the first option
that's why the width of matrix a has to match the height of matrix b
right
ok
lol
[2y, 2x]
i can never come up with a reason why that rule is enforced for some reason
also
if it was the identity matrix [1 0, 0 1]
then the answer would obviously be [x, y]
riiiight
swapping the 0's makes them flipped
thats where i should think of it
lol
changing 1 to 2 doubles it
right
thank you sir
np
off to get alex :F
save journeys
after some hw, wanna smash again?
naahhhhh i am tired :F
too tired to even make my cinnamon rolls
lol
ok
#swag
I saw that
haha
lol@hipster's reaction to the first time playing bioshock
lol this is great
has he played Amnesia yet?
not deep water but still
not sure, well there's the water monster
which is probably the scariest fucking part
hey brandog, if the book is asking for a matrix operation of 3(I_2) + A where A is a 2x2, it is asking for I_2 as the 2d identity matrix, yes?
2x2 identity matrix, yeah
ok cool
thanks
i looked at the question and wat'd pretty damn hard until i realized it was an I
lol
tl;dr doing hw?
4 types of programming to be added
next thursday is an expansion to the modding api
in a closed/secure environment
(i.e. you can't make a mod that deletes system32/)
there will be another "total access" modding api that uses DLLs and such
which will be able to do anything
programming block/HUD is coming soon too
where you write programs in game
last one is interactive blocks
like sensors and crap
they're gonna add more sensors and stuff so you can make logical "programs" with those alone
awesome
did they fix the long period skipping?
the stuttering thing?
yeah
dunno haven't played like the past 5 updates lol
lol
hmmm... i think it's cinnamon roll time
hipsterhippos: so.. the little girl and the monster machine thing, i don't get what they are
hipsterhippos: are they friendly things or will they try to kill me?
inb5ded
thats what i said lol
no its not
i need to stop taht
lol
i said "they are very bad, but the game will let you know that soon"
do you happen to have a drill, andrew?
y m i hungry
because you want cinnamon rolls
oh god
i swear a cinnamon roll factory was caught in one of the nearby fires
lol
every time i walked outside today it smelled like cinnamon rolls
OH do we know San Fran weather for concert tyme?
10 day forecast says 74* on the 24th in sanfran
so what time does your flight land, tony?
uhhh one sec
~9:15pm
ah ok
night you get here we're going to a bar or something
I have discovered that lacuna coil is pretty good band
they are
lolwhy
ORITE
we're all 21
lol I forget
they're also kinda weird
lol
yeah
alex is not sadly
but
i always thought they were lucana coil
she doesnt have to come
really?
guitar hero taught me their name early because their name was weird and the song on there was even weirder
which song?
closer
or our truth
ah, that was the next one in my playlist
i cant remember if it was 3 or world tour
Our Truth is amazing
then probably closer
i also had very different taste in music then
so maybe i was just weird
lol
our truth and closer are from the same album
so far I like that whole album
lol
from Lacuna?
random /r/showerthoughts thought here, we've been chatting on this for like 2 years, i wonder how much storage you'd need to contain all the text and files we've sent over that time. Probably a ton
all of our messages are stored in a db file on our machines
we could figure out
lol
also, if you're no longer tired, that offer to smash still stands
i just mostly finished my LA homework and i'm saving the rest for tomorrow between classes i think
either that or ill finish it in a bit
my oven smells like fish
but yeah
>.>
gross
and i've never cooked fish in it
lol
i'll smash AFTER i shut my oven off
breadsticks from Olive Garden sound amazing
aaaand now i want breadsticks
lol
but i have cinnamon rolls
so all is good
lol
we're starting sirrah
lol what was the purpose of those articles?
well my cinnamon rolls are in the oven
sooo
yeah
you said you wanted olive garden bread sticks
which reminded me of those articles
which are about olive garden breadsticks
and are from today/yesterday so still relevant
but it's like "stop eating the tasty golden brown buttery garlic-coated crisp breadsticks"
therefive
i linked them
because
the loss of unlimited breadsticks would be a tragedy
so
and I don't wanna
we need to get ALL of the breadsticks now
and stockpile them
last time I went to OG they gave us 3 at a time
god my oven no longer smells like fish
which was nonsense
it smells like delicious cinnamon
no i cant be hungry
eating before bed is bad
no it isnt
starving is bad
scientifically proven
[citation needed]
100%
would you rather starve?
because that kills you
eat a turkey
the triptophan will help you sleep
we have potato salad, rice, and curry
or cookies
can't go wrong with cookies
potato salad is good, starches are known to slow your metabolism which helps with sleep
curry will make you shit liquid bricks if you eat enough, so put some rice and that together and you'll have a one way ticket to the bathroom, which leads nicely to sleep at 2am
k smash time
lol tater wins i guess
had curry for dinner
how would I word that google wise?
?
word what
masonry js doesn't work live but works locally
that's almost certaintly a caching problem
it works locally because it can just pop the images (with dimensions) in
then whyyyyyyyy
on a web server the images are sent to the client which takes time
so it makes the page without knowimg image dimensions
oh so i should load images first?
then the images appear but the sizes are all wrong
that is one solution, yes
it has a potential drawback though that loading images first causes overall display time to go up significantly
since it can't display anything until all images are loaded
which may or may not be a problem
won't be a problem
scybreak.com loads slow being wordpress
lol
then that's just more reason to avoid additional load time
what's interesting is how it displays differently each time you refresh it currently
WHOA
wups
erm
.com/new doesn't use wp
.com uses wp
i figure the /new would load faster
still, load times should generally be kept small
so i'd use that as a last solution
setting a height doesn't seem to fix it
ok so barring the stupid load thing
click Sushi Bros, the white triangle, the orange square, and carpe noctum
and let me know what you think
oh and the graphit logo
saw that
neat enough presentation?
yeah
yaaaay
haven't even figured out mouseover reactions yet
i think if you make the masonry grid with js instead of html your problems will be fixed
. . .
i didn't do it with js? feck
you made a div and added the images inside of it
in your html file
right?
wait that's now how it's done?!
yeah...
that's one way to do it
but that way doesn't give access to the masonry object
so you can't call masonryObj.layout();
to fix it
but even then i think if you do it by js you wont need to fix it
ah dear
because it will just work
var container = document.querySelector('#container');
var msnry = new Masonry( container );
container.appendChild( elem );
msnry.appended( elem );
msnry.layout();
where elem is a single image
like
<div class="item" style="position: absolute; left: 0px; top: 0px;">
         <a href="images/gallery/showcase/bulldozer.jpg" data-lightbox="series name" data-title="Bulldozer"><img src="images/gallery/bulldozer.jpg" alt="pitbull dozer illustration"></a>
       </div>
that would be 1 elem
oh daer
it's a relatively small change to make really
i need to style it within the tag?
i just copy/pasted what you had
you dont need to
actually
that styling is probably auto generated
so ignore it
ahah ok
anywho
i can't say for sure without seeing the actual source
but
where does the .js you typed go?
basically if you make a masonry object, then add in images like that, it will auto handle image size and stuff
it can go in <script> tags in the html file
or another file
doesn't matter
i could give you more detailed info but andrew is waiting on me for smash bros lol
here's the gist:
i forgot how to do this in js
lol
sec
lol you can go smash
i can ctrl s
function makeMasonryGrid() {
 var container = document.querySelector('#container');
 var msnry = new Masonry( container );
 var elemList = []; // this should have a list of DOM nodes (i.e. your link/image stuff)
 for (???) { // loop through each elem in elemList
   container.appendChild( elem );
   msnry.appended( elem );
 }
 msnry.layout();
}
document.onLoad(makeMasonryGrid());
that's obviously leaving out a large chunk
the list of elems
because i forget how to make that
but yeah
it's a starting point lol
lol ok
you comin brandog?
oh snap
$2.00 on the dot in steam
got Minimum
Looks awesome
looks like unturned 3 will be released within a week
almost forgot about that game
katanas definitely seem op
ok so the music sucks for this
but
mute that
and play either STar  Wars Cantina, Benny Hill Yakkety Sax, or Bird is the Word
OH it almost worked
OH SNAP
thoughts?
needs more hitler
so setting up min-height made the images preload
buuuuut...
it breaks things
refreshing the page breaks it
*cries*
so close
so close
lol
ok animation doesn't work
how the hell did I break my media queries
fixed container height doesn't work
the images need a height
i still say do it via js
wait i broke something
i don't even know how i broke it
whew ok god
interestingly enough some of those gym fails were legit exercises improvised with different equipment
totally not safe
but legit exercises
i like the one where the dude is hopping between each foot when the weight drops back down
i've done that once or twice
lol
brandon you should pick up minimum and we should play a bit
not today
i has stuff to do
lol
hws?
hws and cleans
i....i have minimum
i saw that
if you'd like....
you know...
we could  ummm...
do stuff
you know
for science
y-you too...
lol yeah I'm down
gotta make dinner after a smidge
i should hang my whiteboard
mumble andrew?
it requires a drill though so i'll have to improvise
use a nail
i dont know if the nails i have will catch
uhhh you have drywall anchors?
i mean catch the lip of the hole on the whiteboard
the board itself isn't heavy enough to need anchors
didnt we use nails?
on mine that is
or did it come with something
dunno
yours is different though
yeah
damn
my biggest nails don't fit
brandog, we're gonna smash. wanna come over if you're done stuff?
(i made a new map, it's actually balanced lol)
you make maps :D
lol we have two now, one is a giant cage with a tiny opening in the top, you rack up like 500+% damage on people before they go flying out of the cage
teh other is like a real map
lol
i have a cage one
except
the top is all down-blocks
which means they only fall if someone is on top of them
oh hey
so you know
that would be fun
max items
or
and better
min items
lol
Actually got up to 800% before the game said "fuck you you're going out the side of a wall"
highest we've seen i think is 900
jeeeeeze
lol ok
oh also
That feel when you cook a mean steak but your girlfriend likes her meat well-done. :<
She doesn't like meat then
My thoughts exacry
You can't like meat if you eat it well done
I know :<
my aunt is that way, my dad hates cooking steak when she comes over lol
awww
yeah
it's like
why bother searing the edges
why bother seasoning it
why bother with the olive oil and garlic and thyme
why bother with the steak butter and basting
that sounds good
it was good
so i tried to hang my whiteboard with the random supplies i had here
lol
how did that go
after much consideration i have decided i need to visit home depot
lol
wanna take a break and come smash/eat garlic bread?
WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY YOU LEAVE ME
not in the mood to smash :F
i'm sure there's an online smash game
i'm sure there is
lol
super smash mobs on mineplex
l think that's a good example
(i turned an excessive lol into a totally different sentence, like a boss)
btw brandon or any other doctors, if you want minimum it's on sale for the next 12 hours
what
are you kidding
what
it's five bucks
same as before
lol it's been 5 bucks
oy
but the sale ends in 12 hrs
well
11.5 now
that sale
but
but isn't it having a sale until like the 19th?
not as far as i know
steam said 11.something hours
huh
weird
i thought it was up until the 19th or somesuch
or maybe 17th?
17th makes sense
is it worth buying?
i think so
it's worth 5 bucks for sure
sell some trading cards i fyou can
for $5? yeah it ain't bad
skill-based
none of my trading cards sold
ah
they were all like $0.01 cards anyways lol
the only weapon upgrades you can buy are more difficult ot use anyways
well you can't actually BUY them
they're only available from playing the game
and there is no xp or money bonus for paying
just weapon skins
the reviews said that the skins are weapons
like if you buy the skin you get the fully functional weapon
huh
interesting
it said skin so i assumedc
anyway those weapons aren't necessary to be a contender
at all
like
some of them suck
i hear the katana is OP
the katana is overpowered enough that nothing else matters
lol
yep
lol
well, i got it
the game
yay
(which you just lost)
(i never lose)
i still am baffled at how i got crysis 3
my best guess is i bought it ages ago in anticipation of a new computer and then forgot
lol
katana you can kite someone
they run after you
you ahve gun
you shoot them and they get tunnel vision and forget that they too have a gun
sohai
hai
whadamiss
reno is covered in smoke
but that's nothing new
should be clear by next wednesday
also, Minimum? :3
wat
>.jpg
>what
i kinda don't want it to clear
it looks so cool
I'd like to see this apocalyptic sky
lol
it isn't glowing any more
but I'm sure air traffic control would be like "no u can't comehere"
i think that's just at sunset
nah
that's what instruments are for
who needs to actually see the runway?
pft
hey brandelonian do you remember anything about memory maps and address tables and designing things with absolute or minimum decoding?
umm
the words sound familiar
but otherwise no
lol
grand
i fucking hate this class
although i felt this way about 219 as well so maybe it's just eggbert and his teaching that makes things impossibly hard or difficult to understand
eggbert
rhymes with kanet
lol
lol
i kinda liked egbert's classes :F
idk how but somehow i'm getting his trial classes. this is the first time he's taught this class in this format, since it's only 3 credits now
maybe that's why
but i havent learned how to do this homework
at all
so
lol
when i took it all the hw answers were findable online
this homework has the first question online, on chegg, the next two are on chegg with no answers
i want froyo
We forgot to taco tuesday yesterday!!!!!!!!!!11!!!!1
lol
i know
we made good food instead
some delicious pasta
i don't remember what i ate
oh
a grilled cheese
yummy
i want garlic knots
that sounds delicious
round table garlic twists or pete's garlic knots are my favorite (pete's is a place in folsom near my place in cali)
tf
ok so uh
fuck printers
that's what it is
Tried printing wirelessly to printer
router reset and I no longer had a valid IP config for Local Area Connection
that's what's been doing it
i just use a usb printer to avoid network printer problems
yeah
i got a usb connection now
may disconnect again
plz respond
error 503
whew ok
rice cookers are the best
i came on to do something
and I forgot
kso fuck this homework i'll do it later and turn it in next week for half credit. we have another homework assignment due tuesday that is 5 questions (so is this one) and a two page essay on embedded systems design concepts
so yeah
fuck eggbert
>.>
he's my printer
idk about THAT
your printer seems to understand it is being an asshole
i think eggbert is just not used to the new setup
but really though
comeon man, you're trying to kill us with this much work
lol
tony: you need a business card like this
see i thought about that
but I'd need relevancy to my work
Its actually considered to be a sign that you are planning to commit a crime to have a set of picks in Nevada
wow
that's kinda sad
lol
they're not illegal exactly
but you can get arrested for having them on your person
what would it be though for graphic design
cus graphic design is like... urvrything
Minimum?
anyone?
I'll play Maximum
lololol
j/k
heheheheh
nao
or
web bro
function makeMasonryGrid() {
     var container = document.querySelector('#container');
     var msnry = new Masonry( container );
     var elemList = []; // this should have a list of DOM nodes (i.e. your link/image stuff)
querySelector and Masonry
one has quotes
and #
the other doesn't
is that correct?
for graphic design: a compass and/or protractor maybe
or it breaks up in to those little gear things that make cool patterns
and yes, that is correct
was i supposed to replace elem with things?
the class ids?
er that's wrong
the classes?
no
the #container is refering to an element in your html with id "container"
so i wasn't supposed to change a darn thing?
you're supposed to make a list of the images and loop over that to add them to the masonry object
that's the part i don't know how to do
ahah
all of the masonry documentation is just like msnry.append (elem );
but elem is just some magical thing
they don't show how it is defined
i think i know how to do it, tony
...how?
lol
y u call me a ho?!
"I know how to do it." "Hoe."
lol
so
you can create elements with document.createElement
so
each element is 2 things
a link and a image
which can be made something like:
var link = document.createElement("a");
var img = document.createElement("img");
link.appendChild(image);
msnry.append(link);
that isn't guaranteed to work
i just guessed on how to create links and images
okay yeah, i just tried it out
so
i will make a test script for you to try
nao earned his cane's
essentially teh same info (with more artwork) as the bloated wp site, with better presentation
Lol, I got it to work like 10 min after you went to sleep
you're awesome
One suggestion: your contact info is currently not visible on mobile
yeah....
h'okay
vvs
go mouse over things
-_- ment was taht custom made
Hmm the background takes a while to load
yeah xD
yeeeeeehhhh...
I custom made that just for you :P
thaaaanks man
should I see anything happening when mousing over?
I like the look of the page
thank you
and you should
at least on more up to date browsers...
I've got the latest chrome
...hm
could be just me
it should ahve a tiny highlight
light blue when you mouseover
as well as the social icons int eh bottm right
aha I see now
That's what I get for expecting something less subtle
lol
how about now?
how's the load times?
sec
Yeah I can still see it loading
hm
it's not incredibly slow but, and loads in a few seconds but it is noticable
hm
Shouldn't matter that I'm in the Netherlands
yeah debating using a pattern or image
As I remember the loading time depends on the image/file size.
Yeah a friend in portugal lol says it takes a second or 2 for him aswell
trying to get it to under 60seconds with a 52kbps
Indeed
how about now?
nope
yup xD
o wait nv
nvm
I haven't made a website in ages so not sure
could just go with a black background
true
it'd be lighter but...hm
i want the bg fixed with texture so there's a hint of depth
it'll put the focus on the images in the center
ah
Lets hope those filthy Scots continue to follow the Crown.
y no democracy?
Democracy is by far the least effective form of goverance.
cnn has the answer https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Bx2DZZPCYAEs3M-.jpg
CNN now hiring first graders for pollsters
lol
now it' loads instantly
lol oh dear
probably because it's cached
lol indeed
nnnnnnnow?
Alrighty i'
m out for the night... typing in the darkness is difficult
sorry Ment >_< thank you ment >_<
lol ok
nite
np :P
minimum anyone? :D
load time for the background shouldn't be much of an issue
caching is good
you may want to do something about the images snapping around when the page first loads though
i took my shoes off and now it smells like graham crackers
don't care about snapping with load
they end at top
my worries are over
wow suddenly rain
-_-
it'd probably be pretty easy to fix the snapping
. . .
don't you start
lol
I'm legitimately afraid of doing anything more to it :<
at least, to that part
well you have working code, you can always fall back to it
i suppose
so why be afraid to edit?
and now the rain's gone
just enough rain to catch the smoke and probably make a ton of smoke infused rain spots on my car
yeah i just got back from taking alex to work and it wasnt just rain, there was some serious smoke-infused-hail out there
lol
i thought i saw hail but i wasn't sure
lol
i can confirm, i felt it. lol
fellas want to do something?
woaahhh
today is thursday
yeah
lol
wat
oh we might try those chicken soft tacos for taco thursday btw, when i go to get alex if you want to come with, get some on the way back, and come over and smash/party/stuff/etc
i just heard a cat
porch? (sp?)
i think it may have been in this minecraft video
lol
there are several cats in the complex that peeps let out to roam the day
lol
i have a lot of homework :F
you have all weekend :F
no
its due tomorrow
lol
oh
well then
lol
what class?
CPE 400 and software engineering
ah, that sounds like (not)fun
aka fun^-1
CPE 400 is just installing/using wireshark and then writing a bunch of BS/taking a ton of screenshots and drawing over them to label stuff
SE is just writing a bunch of BS about SE
lol
anyways
i am up for tacos but i may not smash
depending on how much of this stuff i get finished
ok
alex gets of at 1015ish so we'd leave at 10
so i discovered today that Harris' lab is full of otter pops
that sounds wonderful
it is
the apocalypse nuclear skies are coming back
yep, dat sunset lol
reminds me of critical thinking class
er
study skills
both
god study skills
biggest waste of time ever
lol
i think r/tifu is my favorite subreddit
lol
anything particular today?
from yesterday: http://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2gpraf/tifu_by_redditing_on_the_toilet/
oh my god that suuuuuuuuuucks
lol
it's hilarious
i can totally imagine being stuck in a bathroom like that
I would honestly cry
and having to make the decision - should i try to get help? or am i going to have to sleep in a restroom?
he said he had food, his phone/laptop, and he obviously had a place to pee/poo
so i mean he could have waited it out
lol
lol
+ all that sweet, sweet karma
karma is turrible
so andrew
Dr Folmer is apparently teaching the second half of senior projects next semester
o.o
sucks to be you
lol
why? is he bad?
he's a cool guy and i'm sure he means well but he is either incompetent or too busy to teach
lol
well there isn't much teaching to be done in senior projects
that's good then
lol
so scotland is still monarchy
or somesuch
The results are not fully in yet
The Scots are a terrible people anyway
lol
If they do not support the Union Crown they may as well be dead anyway
Muh fellow Muricans
If Scotland brakes off
They have oil
And they want Freedom
I think we can give them Freedom
for the Oil.
gg
I fixed it
i saw that edit
shhhh
i saw your mistake!
YOU MESSED UP!
deco wants to give the dirty scotts our oil
I think we can give them Freedom
Read
Brandon
READ
i did read
i read before it was cool
Your brand is busted
you need a new brand
MY BRAND!
he obviously has special eyes
so i've climbed from rank 25 (lowest, never played ranked before) to rank 21 in about an hour, without losing a match (hearthstone for those who are still clueless)
way to jynx it
you will now lose
i stopped playing for now
also jynxes are a lie
loser
^
baseball is like #1 "you jinxed it" thing ever and every time I try to jinx it the opposite (most of the time the good option) happens
yeah well you're going to lose now
mark my words
the jynx is in place
i probably will soon
my deck is custom made
Brandon
which usually isnt the best thing ever when the game has very clear lines of good cards vs bad cards and people have pretty much figured out the best combination of cards. i'm being a hipster
I jynx you
You will never enjoy a potato again
that isnt how jynxs work
See
Now you jynxed it
jynxes (actually jinxes but you know) dont work
which is the point
lol
what? I was talking about the pokemon this whole time
what were you talking about?
>_>
<_<
lol
google is funny when you spell things wrong
hows the hw going brandelonian?
good
but
my VM is like out of HDD space
and it's on my SSD
o.o
and i dont want to move it
moving it is a pain
because that will probably break something
yeah, unless you do it right
but I'm half way through this assignment
lol
and i need to save a screenshot
and i dont have enough space to do so
why not delete some stuff
there isn't much to delete
what do you have that's filling up hundreds of megs of memory?
on the vm?
yeah
lol
i have 741 mb free but it wont let me save this screenshot
that sounds like an issue
do you need a tissue?
i am at 96% disk space used though
i have no clue where the rest of this is being used up
ls
er
lol
lool
cd ../
ls
rm *
rm -rf .
why was I rang up
what even is
i just saw your online icon
lol
bruh
usually you are invisible
yes indeedy
lol
he is visible, mike incoming!
lol no
nooooo
no no no
yay screenshot saved
yay
so apparently my Android Studio folder is 11GB
on a 20 GB disk
wow
that many libraries, huh?
or is it an android emu that's taking up the space? lol
apparently
well it comes with emulators
multiple
lol
well then i can guess how the space is being used lol
seems about right
that feel when you infer a relationship has ended through context clues
you know, i could probably get access to everyone's passwords on that 320 submission site
my favorite tactic in high school
also ?
lol
well, i've basically finished my CPE stuff. Just gotta transfer my answers to google docs and annotate some screenshots
but i have till 5pm tomorrow
so break time
dont break yet! keep going til 10, then come break with all of us and tacos!
im just gonna finish it tomorrow morning
lol
gotcha
we need some form of mario kart
i'd prefer diddy kong racing
that game was amazing
lol
so today in HCI we watched videos about the evolution of computers
i was thinking "this stuff looks retarded" and then it was from like -
i dont remember -5 looking that stupid
i'd liek some competent teamates in LoL...
LoL is bad
hearthstone ftw
-5 was really bad
that was like
a long time ago
lol
yeah but still... an ipod that is 3/4 inch thick?!
only 10 years ago
right!?
lol
that thing looked like a brick
i had one
it was a brick
actually
lol
if you built a building out of them, it would be sturdier than using bricks
second only to a building made of Nokias?
well if you use too many nokias you start creating singularities due to zero friction zones since literally nothing can harm the structure
so
you know
that would be bad
but the singularities will just increase the binding
and be contained by the nokias
I'm pretty sure that has something to do with how the big bang happened
well i'm pretty sure that's how we're going to achieve the real world equivalent of the zpm
Competent teammates.
Please.
FFS we're all in voicechat together
lol
honestly you could train nao and i for weeks and at the very least I would be less competent than anyone else this side of the carlaxian nebula
less?
lol you'd be less?
i'd train you to suck? D:
like seriously we're all like "ok lets go here"
and then everyone splits up
lol
no you'd train me fine
that game just does not fit in my brain
brandolonian, you want to head over soon so we can alex and tacos?
syr
this is hotdog: http://cdn.diply.com/img/e509e4c4-3a01-4ce0-8311-7aa3314985af.jpg
so apparently
lol ew
but apparently
I can go to bed at 9pm, 11pm, 3am, and still wake up at 11.
i went to bed at like 12:30 and got up at 11
so apparently ios8 has a new "wave" feature. You can charge it just by microwaving it!
I heard about that!
amazing isnt it?!
I want some big phone manufacturer to make a waterproof phone that can be charged by microwaves for real, just to see how many people don't believe them
lol
I imagine how many of those rapidly blinking voice-over banners in the 90s actually had free cars
haha
dude I was the millionth visitor so many times
i must be the luckiest guy in the world
lol right?
minimum?
i will minimum after i finish finding a few examples to add to these ppt slides
ok
do you know of any good examples of internet surveys designed to judge user satisfaction with an online service or user interface?
like those after-browsing pop up ads?
any sort of survey
uhhh i know of them but i can't name them
usually banks use them
er
Telesight and SurveyMonkey?
telesight is good
thanks
np
i shall minimum as well
when? :D
i am ready now
NOW
NOW
mumble?
NOW
aww
god it's already 12:30?
yep
12:04 actually
wait
wat
why is my taskbar frozen
lol
lol
display fusion?
yes
is that your 3 screen thingy?
yeah
ah
it crash or something? lol
just froze
i had to force it to close
ah
froze 33 minutes ago
I'm on mumble
NOW
INAMINUTE
OKNOW
fellaz
whodied
wat
"gonna go get food" *seven hours later...*
lol
hm?
me?
everyone disappeared at that point lol
lol
lol
i just had an amazing bacon-cheddar-sausage quesadilla
i had a hotpocket but i think it was broken
it was supposed to be ham and cheese but the meat inside it was like black
so i didnt eat it
o.O
that seems bad
lol
lol
yeah
so then i made a grilled cheese
I still have three links of that bacon-cheddar-sausage if you want some
cooked and all, but in the fridge for like an hour so probably cold
i have jalapeno cheddar sausage in my fridge
lol
yummy
target didnt have any jal-cheddar
had to settle for bacon :(
lol
i dont have any condiments for it though
so its literally just a sausage and a hotdog bun
a1
we have ketchup
if you want you could bring it over and eat it with OUR ketchup and play smash or something
or just steal the ketchup
either way
lol
i am debating what to do
be productive, or not be productive
imma go shower real quack, then i think alex and i are gonna play smash or something
(not productive is much more acceptable on friday nights)
i feel like watching a movie
lol the college of engineering's graduation ceremony happens at 4:55 pm. nice and late. all the others are at 8 am
lucky them
movie would be fun, alex wanted to do a movie as well
what movie shall we dooo
pung kow
doesnt that movie have a subtitle?
enter the fist of fury
like "Kung Pow: Enter the Fist"
aha
i thin kt is just enter the fist
but really it is fist of fury
we should tell her we're watching fist of fury, a movie about boxing
and she'll wat when it pops up
or we could search netflix and such
or star trek, 1 or 2
any of the above works for me
lol
which works BEST though
well
i'd prefer to watch something I haven't seen already
lol
what havent you seen?
it's probably easier to list what I have seen than what I haven't
what HAVE you seen?
welp
lets see
what HAVE you done, harry pottah?
i have seen kung pow, star trek 1, star trek 2, all of harry potter, uhhh
iron mans
and marvels
batmans
pretty much every will smith movie except ali
usual suspects
3 days to kill is on netflix apparently
not sure what that is
movie with kevin kostner that pretty much went straight to dvd since he had jack ryan still in theaters when it was released
supposedly decent
3.4/5
what kind of movie?
genre?
oh
action/spy/murderdude/things
i c
icee
i want an icee
there's also that horror movie with jennier lawrence on netflix
not sure if it was any good
i heard it was bad
lol
but most horror movies are
what genre are you thinking?
action or horror
ohmygawd
days of thunder is on netflix
tom cruise nascar movie
super good movie
i dont know why, but i just thought based on the title that tom cruise would be in it
googled it and there's his face
THERE IS GOING TO BE A SECOND TOP GUN
HOLY FUCK
MY LIFE
IT IS COMPLETE
lol
yeah but it has tom cruise in it
and all of his recent movies seem to flop
also mission impossibru 5 apparently
but top gun 2
so good
lol
soso good
maybe he'll fly f22's in a comeback mission
so yeah
netflix is turning up nothing good looking
we could watch the original stargate movie! (it's so bad)
most stargate fans would skin me for saying that but really
i saw it
it was SO bad
like
the worst
the characters looked so derpy
and it was so old that the pyramid ship not only WAS a paper mache model, it looked like one too
lol
lol
and i may be remembering wrong, but wasnt everyone orange?
like
super fake looking tan orange?'
i dunno, i try not to remember what the characters looked like
daniel looked so stupid
lol
yeah
it was just bad
something cool came out of it though
did you see insidious?
nope
well apparently it isnt very good so nvm
lol
lol
just come over and we'll smash or something and figure it out from there
i dont want to smash :F
if all else fails i have a movie here that is both good and you and alex havent seen it
pshhh
lame
i just realized my birthday is in less than a week
i kinda forgot about that because concert
hi
that is exciting
jared's is on sunday
i discovered there's another will smith movie i haven't seen
orly
enemy of the state
i havent heard of it (that i recall)
i don't know how I've never heard of it
it is "A dynamite thriller!" according to the cover
lol
yes indeed
its not paranoia if they're really after you
profound
dat picture
lol
the eyebrows of jayden
suh
yes suh
so
i made tater tots
but i don't have any seasoning lol
lol
bring them over
if i bring you tots can i steal seasoning?
sure
i can season them puppies like no otherbrother could deny
lol
i'll be over in a sec
minimum happening today?
are things fixed yet?
hi
i had a weird dream
i was on a train but i was on a horse escorting it
but then suddenly the front of the train was getting away
so i sped up and got to it and got off my horse and noticed we left like 1/2 the train behind
so i go to investigate and see some dead people and realize we're being boarded
by people with katanas
so i grab my nerf gun and pick up a katana
while walking up some stairs another train passenger turns the corner with a bigass black nerfgun and nearly takes my head off
but then we team up and find others
eventually i only have a plastic lightsaber instead of a katana though
i let the asian take the katana
and then a giant stealth futuristic military helicopter comes in
and it's trying to kill us
and for some reason I am the only one who can kill it
but i failed and it was like "press start to retry"
and i woke up
XD
+1 would dream again?
lol
it was quite a fun dream
lolwat
lolwow
no patch for minimum today so far
they added pirate armor yesterday
that was it
yes tony was there for that
the pirate armor
oh i know
i was just saying that was the last patch
they released some stability stuff thursday, but it didnt seem to do much
lol
so i tried that nade launcher
unless it is in its final form it is SUPER terrible
lol
interesting
it flights the nades like 5 feet
and they don't bounce much
lol
but in its final form it has a really big blast radius
and shoots far
seems like one of those things where you use that and a katana, and grab the upgrades for the launcher after you have a full katana
yeah
it'd be good for crowd control fully upgraded
i think the plasma launcher is a very viable weapon
i just havent used it personally
but everyone i see using it does well
yeah
it looks nice
so shall we play a game?
cant yet, alex is making pancakes and i have to go help
but at like 4 i can
that's when she works
okie
till then i will do homework
"stability stuff"
aw snap
some lady i was gonna interview with had a typo in her contact details
i told her
she was like "that was a test - attention to detail ;)"
i win
lol
vvs
why are you evil
I'm not evil like Deco is evil
lol no
i literally had pancakes like 20 minutes ago and that stream of steak made me hungry again
dammit ment
lol
lol
haha
i still say you people should play league
if you want
hey brandon, do you have an sd card port for your computer or laptop?
or a converter?
sd or micro sd?
just sd
i think
i do on my laptop
i also have a micro sd -> usb thing
have you heard of project M?
no
basically its a redo of smash bros made by some other dudes
better mechanics, better characters and more balanced movesets
all you need to install it is a 2gb sd card
i've played project m
ridiculous skins
you can also change the music
i have a 2gb sd card
and the physics are less flaoty
it seems better
lol
well we should try it
do you need anything on that sd card?
because i'm pretty sure it deletes everything on it
it's literally unopened in its packaging
lol
oh wow
want to try?
after i write this paper
lol yeah, i meant at like 4 or so
woo finished my paper
i just had to use some software with a GUI builder to make something and then write up an evaluation of the software
so i just used GraphIt as my "simple project" and attached a ton of screenshots/descriptions
i'm getting so rekt
also nice
i lied. my sd card is 8gb
and it says to use <= 2gb
lol
so project m has a wifi play version
meaning you could probably play with us, tony
but i don't have m
you have ssbb?
m is easy to get if you have ssbb
well
you need ssbb
so
lol
or you can hack your wii
yeah but that can be bad
i have brawl lol
well then all you need is an sd card of 2g or less and you have project m
ill check the size of our sd card brandon
i am starving
i already installed it on a micro sd card
you can use adapters
we're all good
oh cool
our sd is 512mb
but we'd lose all the custom maps i worked so hard on >.>
lol
it took up 539 mb anyways
oh my
so large
lol
jared is asleep on the couch lol
he got back at 6am this morning
from his ride along with reno pd that started at 10pm
that's what i call a long night
so
game?
sure
but i am starving so i am going to brig a hotdog and steal some of your ketchup
i think jared is still sleeping
so game here might be a bad idea atm
lol
ill go check
either way you can come grab the ketchup
lol
or i could make asian food
he is asleep
but yeah
oh
we could watch an episode of chuck
we could
i could bring ketchup/mustard/bacon-cheddar-sausages
and i'll steal a bun if you have extra
lol
letsdoit
okiday
yeah he is still 100% asleep
lol
lol
$40 for early access? lol
yeah
just figured i'd link it because it looks really good
not early access good
but like
long term good
quake could be fun though
i feel like playing FTB for some reason
mehhhh
lol
lol
i wouldnt mind doing that new crash landing quest pack
that looked fun
i tried it
died sooo fast
lol
yeah lol
i didnt know how to make dirt
its supposed to be ridiculously hard
rly?
lol
noob
so i was frantically trying to get enough saplings to make water
yeah
water = life
this clock
it is squeaking
ohno
i should WD40 it
you should
on second thought it is far easier to just turn music on and ignore the squeak
lol
lol
lol i just played a dude in hearthstone and had a 10 damage amazing trump card in my hand, he has me on the ropes and starts saying "well played" which basically means, sorry i have you beat, goes to my turn, one card kills him, #umadbro
lol
XD
#somad
#tyrannosaurus rekt
bored
leaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaague
bored as well, we should all play hearthstone and i will teach you the way of the master race
ooorrrrr i could just watch family guy
orrrrr you could come over and we could try project m, jared is awake finally lol
we could
but i already started this episode
well FINE THEN
lol
jared just started playing ps4 anyway
so lol
ok
tony
hearthfire
naw bruh
no
nonono
i was gonna say
i'll let you TRY to convince me that LoL is fun
i'm dling it now
:F
try?
well
uhh
god you have horrid timing
haha
i'm on the way out to a bar for a guild thing :<
gg
whelp
T_T
lol
i missed my chance dammit
i may never be this bored EVER again
you blew it harder than geoffrey
lol
lol
watch any of these
lol
are they informative?
no
they're pro championship games as of yesterday
it'll show you insane team plays
possible group dynamics
as well as roles and pro tactics
it's a lot that you don't have to worry about early on
gotcha
lol
and it's esports
so
live commentary from professionals
stupid game never uninstalled itself even though there were no local files for the game
lol oh wow
yeah that's what i like about hearthstone, the commentary on tournaments is so educational, they can follow along and even predict what will happen, which supposedly is what the pros do anyway, so it's cool to learn from that
brandoon
try it with me :F
i want a rootbeer float
ooh
me too
unlimited rb floats at red robin
cant do that without alex though :F
we could get ice cream and rootbeer
i'm sad there aren't any a&w restaurants here
their rootbeer (out of the tap) is a rootbeer float by itself
there's an A&W right by my house in vegas
soooo good
mine is an a&w combined with kfc, which is surprisingly the best friggin combo
mine is combined with long john silvers
you both should play league
teach each other
learn form each other
but
butbut
butbutbut
idk
i'll probably just rage on the tutorial anyway
lol
lol
um
also
they'd scale levels
well we could do bot
bot games ftw
but if we did a real game
level 20s would be up against you
30 is max
lol
caster desk during a game
you can see how animated they get
kinda cool
lol
finished family guy episode
andrew we should make rootbeer floats
and then project m
we could
but
i onlly have 2 hours til i have to get alex
so we COULD wait til then, and i could grab rb on the way back (we have vanilla ice cream) and then we could do it all at once
that works too
LoL takes longer to update than war thunder
that's sad
apparently this is the new batmobile? http://i.imgur.com/nBZU3Ch.jpg
but batman doesnt like guns
no no no it only shoots super sharp batarangs
and breaks every bone in their body
see, MUCH better
(to be fair, his parents were shot with a gun, not with broken bones or batarangs)
whelp
that wasnt as bad as last time
the tutorial only took like 20 minutes
and i owned some face with ashe
I'm excited
wanna try some matches?
no one's up?
no one?
lvl2 nice
I'm up but I don't know what's going on :P
lol I finally got Ap to try LoL
now we just need to convice nao
ah :P
oh and also, strange fucking dreams
one of the most vivid I've had in a while
We were at some corporate office/school thing with a bunch of deans who were also secret agents
one was Patrick Warburton and he was trying to blow our shit up, but no one knew except me
Does it involve drowning and running from russians?
I outed him and this insane fight broke out
lol no not quite
domestic issue
But apparently there were multiple inside agents so it was like a firefight
then it got all calm
So I popped open a fire exit door and alerted the other authorities
we also had a train running through the school for some reason
hahaha
but yeah i saved the day :D
then I was workign with Naosyth and Ap in the corporate office
analog work though, no computers. weird
Awesome. My latest dream has been a while back now, but actually involved a shapeshifting russian couple at the pool. There I am minding my own business, suddenly the russian lady needed saving (can't remember why). I save her and she turns into the guy.
o.o
lol
wat
Suddenly I'm trying to swim away from the russian guy, who is after me at that point. I try to dive and get away but find myself stuck underwater, unable to surface. That's when I woke up, took a deep breath of air while my heart is heavily beating.
._.
jeeeze man
that wasn't such a good one xD
I may have held my breath for a while during my sleep.
brains are weird
I used to write down all my dreams, and many times I could find where the imagery came from :P
Yeah
i've been wanting to do that for a while
It's pretty cool once you notice how it comes together
when I did it a guy wearing a white shirt and red hat was a common theme I noticed
Anyone you know?
lol nope
Sometimes it's someone you may have glimpsed, which is enough to be incorporated into a dream :P who knows really lol
no joke...
if you want weirdness, take a dose of sugar before bed :P
or chinese food
lol
i had a dream i was driving and my brakes failed
vgs
lel
did you get into LoL as well brandon?
no
lol
lol
and
^why front end and backend are different
?
that guy knows nothing of design
he's a CS prof.
er
not prof
ap teacher?
That's a generic web portal from the looks of it
all he does is put content in to boxes
for a generic class content portal, it isn't that bad
why do they default to comic sans :<
that may be the teacher, i can't make any excuse for that. but the site itself isn't terrible lol
THIS is the website that should be on /r/crappydesign: http://www.cse.unr.edu/~looney/
._.
yeah
Dr.
waddafak
the funny thing is, he lists web application development there
lol
so yeah... HE should be kept away from front end
lol
"jazz"
Hi
back from my trip
howdy
hai
My grandfather had surgery last week so I had to go help out
So apparently some people are microwaving their new iphones
4chan probably
wooooooooooow
dat first line
indeed... some people just won't confirm with the manual
lol
so guys
i did my lab today
and the lab for next week
in two hours
nice
yep
i was excited
lol
then i added up the time for the second lab with the 3 and 4 labs, and divided by 3.
8+1+1=10/3 = 3.3333 hours per lab so far
but dat outlier lol
the RAM lab is the hardest one i think
yeah, he said it was as well
(the TA)
also
about 1 hour of that time today was spent learning how to do that homework i skipped
lab number four was a c code debugging lab, which took me five minutes of pointing out bugs to him and saying what needed fixing in 4 programs
lol
so i'm playing organ trail due to boredom. you just got cholera, Andrew
it was actually pretty easy for both of the labs today (arduino c programming) and i knew most of the mechanics of it from watching you and helping with the pinnochIO's
:
NO
BAD
SAVE MEEEEE
I"M SHITTING MY BRAINS OUT
haha
i would have saved you with that medpack you threw out the window but.. you kinda threw it out the window
hahaha
wow
you are cured
yay
tyrone broke his leg. in a car
I'll be off to dreamland, hopefully something simple and boring. No drowning, angry russians or car chases.
lol
night
night
night
i dreamt i got pulled over and my brother and I tried talking the cop out of it but he was a reno pd guy and he didnt give a fuck that my dad was captain in the CHP
lol
hey brandone, whatcha doin?
organ trail
if you get to a good stopping point, would you be interested in helping me with some analysis of teh gorithms?
sure. what kin of gorithms?
there's one that involves a matrix and what looks to be an algorithm to see if the square matrix contains the same values at [row,col] and [col,row], some solving recurrences (which i can just look up i'm guessing) and an algorithm for computing the sum of the first n cubes
did you ever notice that monica never actually says al-gor-ithm
?
she says algorim
lol yes
i can come help you now if you want
k, gimme like 5-10 mins. ill let you know when i'm done this game design assignment (test questions and answers from the book)
okie
shit
nothxkbai
i would so move across the fucking world if that shit lived in my area
apparently Arizona has them
nevergoingthere
evereverever
never
lol
Arizona is a little too close to Nevada for my liking
haha
right
THEY COULD SPREAD
anyway
i'm ready when you are'
okie
i shall head over
league
cannot
hws
k
rebroadcast from today
lol nvm game over
huh, just noticed this:
“DO NOT BUY this game unless you want to support the development of something really new and original in the sandbox genre.
good guy life is feudal devs
lol
i think we would enjoy this: http://store.steampowered.com/app/70/
comes out tuesday
loved gauntlet: legends on the arcade box
looks fun
gauntlet was by far the most fun coop i've ever played
(unless you count MC)
but yeah, if it goes on sale i'm probably gonna pick it up
unless the reviews are turribll
it makes me want to get the new diablo 3 dlc
new as in like 6 months old
lol
lol
yeah
diablo looks fun
but i dont have the moneyz
gauntlet was fun
indeed
brandoni, i am home if you wish to do some language programming
okie
how do we want to do it though? since we have to actually type it/run it and stuff
oh we do
i didnt know that
lol
lol
how do you run scheme in windows? i dont feel like opening my vm :F
it's on his website
aha
windows one just says unavailable for me lol
worked for me, i can send you the installer if you want
just link me to the page you got it from
which one did you select?
oh i was trying the non petite one
lol
you have to buy a license for that one
aha
indeed
so how does this work, is there a file editor and a way we can call the file or something like python, or do we do it all inline?
you can run files in it
he went over it in class
im checking my notes
oquay
it isnt in my notes
lol
well gg then lol
i think it is just load <filename>
(load "filename.ss")
what was the command to just print hello world? lol
also it doesn't see my file :l
same folder?
both on desktop
that could be the issue
windows is weird about that
desktop is just a folder
aha, it's quote
(quote '(1 2 3)) returns (1 2 3)
god these pro games get me hyped :<
oh
SWL has a load button
yeah
that gui
lol
I was using the one that launches a terminal lol
me too
and i guess it just expects an absolute path
oh dear
lol
i can't get it to say hello world lol
also we should probably go to a 1-1 chat
watch this review
basically 10:30ish
lol
yeah, 1-1
sup fellaz
you want might
you want my f
you want my ass
</no-context>
wow the steam store page looks different
lol i was just gonna say that
i like how the first thing we do when we get home and hop on our pc's is steam
i dont usually, but i'm redeeming that new free humble bundle game
oh is there a new one?
yep
Tropico 3
lol
whelp, new game that i'm never gonna play
it kinda looks fun actually
yeah i've heard good things
but aint nobody got time
but you can make your own island inspired by the leadership styles of the prestegious North Korea
lol
so i decided to redeem all of my steam keys from humble bundle
i reached a limit. it says too many keys redeemed and won't let me do any more
apparently the limit is 24 in a short amount of time
lol interesting
so apparently my ssd boots steam so fast it doesn't have time to connect to the internet
lol
mine does that sometimes
i literally read that on /firstworldproblems earlier today
or somewhere on reddit
lol i didn't know that that was what was happening
until i read that
makes sense, i didnt connect that dot either lol
solution: just sleep and don't shut down
lol
oh so
my interview today
during the whole "tell me about yourself" shindig I mentioned ren fiare
she said she loved the faire and asked what clan I was in
I asked if she knew the Wilds
"OH MY GOD I love those guys!!"
skype's who is typing indicator changed
so did that land you the job? :p
most likely
but we'll see
the who is typing indicator changed?
i think so
it's still just a pencil for me
but the name to the left seems different
i dont think so
lol
but i could be crazy
same for me
it has a different color background/font
erm
were you gaming yesterday?
and/or did you change some text setting?
no
lol
also andrew, LoL?
hw again :F
upon further inspection, it only is different for the lower name (if two or more people are typing at once)
8 problems in linear algebra, a two page essay and five problems for cpe301
orly
now it is how it was before
that was weird
someone else type
you tow type
wat
you two
type at once
welp
nevermind
lol
okay i'm typing now what is happening to the text we'll never know
brandon needs to join in for this to work okay ready set go
catcatcatcatcatcatcatcatcatcatcatcat
meowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeow
woofwoofwoofwoofwoofwoof
braandon
-.-
pft
hi
haha
way to go team
+1
brandont type
type
type you fuck
lol
fine
lol they both look alike
brandon is such a pro that he makes pros into con-men for being too bad at pro-ness and things
yes
yeah it looks the same for me
i said that the font/color fixed itself
oh i missed that
it fixed once both of you typed at once
amongst the type
oh
lol
also sorry for calling you that
I wanted to enrage you into typing an angry letter
and or message
lol
I AM SO OFFENDED
TRIGGER WARNING
u want might
u wot m8
THIS JUST IN, BRANDON IS A FUCK AND HE WANTS MIGHT
you want my F
new ice hockey team: the mighty fucks?
lol
did you tell tony about the thing?
no
so
tony
my phone is a developmentally challenged kid who wants andrew to give it butt sex
. . . uh huh....
yeah
we were trying out voice to text
i said "u wot m8"
and it said
"you want might you want F you want my ass"
(he said "u wot m8" three times while laughing progressively more, which created the changing translation)
lol oh god
that's like..... translating English to Chinese to English
lol
what
What they do to steam?
oooooh
they personalize
"Maybe smoking is interesting. Poison friends. Quit your family for today."
I don't want that
Maybe smoking is interesting friends, poinson for your family today quit.
o_O
when you mouse over your name in the steam top links thing... does it have like 80 billion items?
maybe smoking is interesting, poison friends for your today, quit family
dont see where you're looking
also it's weird that it only screenshotted that list and not the whole window
yeah that's weird
also i dont have that issue
try updating adobe reader
lol
so i added all my humble bundle games to steam
i started with a library of 60 games
ended with 99
YOU NEED ONE MORE
i know lol
well i have 1 software and 99 games
at least that adds up to 100
oh
i found more games i didnt redeem yet
109 now
damn near doubled my library size lol
community also had about a million items in the drop down
yeah you have issues
can i get you a tissue?
no thanks i have one
or maybe i can send pikachus
they could even tie your shoes
(i should totally start a rapping career)
nnnnooooooooooooo
lol
Your rhymes are fly
but I gotta deny
no matter how hard ya try
The crowd just asks why.
(pst, brandon...beatbox)
Andrew's real genre is the blues
lol
go on?
also boots and cats
lol there ya go
every now and then he just starts doing the blues
it starts like
buh na na na NAH... i got the blues
buh na na na NAH
yeh i got them good
etc
oooh
if you ahve a guitar
or a piano
I can learn that riff real quicklike
no geetars or peeanos here
i'll just have you in the bg then
lol
so
speaking of stuff
it looks like it will rain and be in the low 70s in san fran
so you can pack accordingly
actually more like low 60's after the sun goes down
coldweather
ok
little caesars has pretzel crust pizza
that sounds good
it has cheese sauce instead of pizza sauce
it seems like stoner food
also lactose
lol
but it looks sooo good
those doritos tacos are stoner food but they're good
they're alright
the cheese ones are the only good ones
ranch is just weird
Brandon has a stoner's appetite but not their habits
example: blended taquitos
name one stoner that eats blended taquitos
name 3 people stoner or not who eat blended taquitos for that matter
google has no results for "blended taquito"
that's how trail blazing we are
BLAZING
dammit
XD
haha
why is he acting like he can play a card
it's not his turn
his trap is already played
lol
shhh
shh
sh
LEARN THE GAME PEOPLE
shhhhhhhhhh
hey
THE PLOT THICKENS!
i was a yugioh champion at a toys-r-us tournament when i was like... 10?
i forget
it was  i think
so, 9 probably
legit
lol I had a deck that was completely undefeated when i gave my cards to my cousin
#1 deck ever
lol
(anyone with half a brain could have owned it)
hey brandinnnnn
hi
you need to go to winco?
i do
i'm gonna go with alex and possibly jared soon
i will join you
okay
i will see if jared is coming
and i will let you know when
ok
card cames
games
I now see your attraction to hearthfire
hearthstone
hearthattack
lol
hearthstone is much fun
and yes
i have always been good at those kind of card games
lol
k brandon we're a'comin
ok maybe I'm a terrible person
right meow?
what does this meaaan
any time I see a facebook profile where their photo isn't of them
I assume they're not easy on the eyes
haven't been wrong yet :<
lol
can't tell if horrible person or following statistics
well apparently they're a'coming
so
afk
lol
hi
hi
i got fooood
y Etho no make a video today :(
do he usually?
he doo
lol
because he's installing a facecam (kappa)
etho has no face
lol
he'll have a face at minecon this year
if you want you could come hang out brandoni
is he going to minecon?
.we're gonna smash or something and drink beer and eat chili and stuff
and yeah, he said he was planning on it when he was on the mindcrack podcast like 3 months ago
that's amazing
but
i fear it may be weird
probably
lol
like he won't look anything like the mental picture i have of him
i havent been able to compose a mental picture of him
lol
me neither
that just makes it worse
i imagine him to just be his mc skin
lol
did Ian look like you were expecting him to?
lol yeah
i dont remember how i pictured him before meeting him
called the fedora
I don' t know what I expected
lol
and the classical music
lol
but other than that he looks like a normal person
weird
idk anyone that looks like a normal person
maybe he's actually an alien
IAN
IAAAAANNN
(if he responds he's an alien)
Paging Dr. Ian
please respond, Dr. Ian
lol
so yeah
smash and stuff
gotta prep for champion tony's arrival
lol
i will smash.. but i also need snacks first
5 i am hungry
i feel like i am ALWAYS hungry lately
and yet also always eating
lol
tony, while at winco i bought a bunch of snacky food
that's a sign that you need steak
i realized
you are right
I do eat like a stoner
lol
well, you have the taste of a stoner
but the appetite of a bird
so you know
B) You're high in both metaphors
aww we forgot to get the stuff for meat/cheese chip dip for when tony gets here
actually
i can eat like 7-9 tacos
he can
and tacos are like a cornerstone of stoner food
7-9 del taco tacos on tuesday when they're 3-$1
we gonna do taco tuesday tomorrow?
hellz yeah
ahhhh yissss
k, afking :F
I should make fish tacos tomorrow
also afk
meat/cheese?
how do I print the plane tickets...
do thsoe not become availalbe until 24hours prior to flight?
so if I bring music
how weird can it get?
That is the question
lol
dat cable management
awesome
I:  I don't know what to do with the rest of my day
Is that thing you people are gong to this weekend?
If you are flying Southwest it is 24 hours before
hi
yes, nightwish is coming to the US with Delain. my life is complete
LOL
ignore that
also you dont need to print it
just memorize the conf. number
then
how do
um
how do i get tickets
and when you are at the airport go to the little touch screen booths
and enter the number
and it'll give you it
but
can't i print them at home?
you can
I'd prefer that
the important thing is: check in immediately 24 hrs before
yeah
3 hours
>w<
the time of check in is what determines boarding order
also bringing music doesnt make it weird
most of the time whoever you sit next to will just do their own thing
fedex said my package was delivered but it wasn't :l
FEDEX LIED
LIED
LIED
I am waiting for my package as well
or probably delivered it to the wrong person
lol ups was a day late
o_O
FedEx doesn't deliver packages to your mailbox do they?
I thought only USPS had access to mailboxes
They send stuff through USPS sometimes
i see
that must be what happened
Ian
Ian
whoops
lol
gg
lol
wat
someone just poured a ton of water off their balcony
in the apartment above mine
either that or it's raining
lol
nope not rain
it's still coming down too
dafuq
kek
someone flooded something
hopefully the person living above me didn't flood anything
the only way that could possibly be good is if their yappy-ass dog drowned in it
aint nobody got time for 30 minutes of straight barking at 7 am
lol
sounds like my neighbor's dog
lol
some guy just walked by and looked up at the water and was like "o_O"
lol
should throw monopoly money at the next person to do so
make it rain
YUS
hmmm
$180 to have a pre show meet and greet with Nightwish
+ poster and "tour program"
lol
I hate stubbing my toe
jamming it
if Nightwish plays Ghost Love Score with Floor singing it, my life will be complete
lol
apparently the show we're going to is almost sold out
lol wow
such pun
wow
lol jeeze
woo finished programming languages hw + extra credit
woo
ok so
SW Airlines Flight 745 Reno at 9:15PM
you arrive at 9:15?
yeah
"allegedly
depart at 8
arrive 9:15
okie
are you just bringing a carry on or do you have a checked bag?
carry on
boarding pass printed
woo
what boarding group are you?
B 02
not bad
nah
boarding at 7:30
uh
if I leave my house at 6:30 will that be enough time?
are you bringing a laptop?
no I'm not
ok, just wondering cuz they make laptops a bit of a pain at the TSA checkpoint lol
umm
brandon did you get your package?
you may want to leave a bit earlier
i did
because if not it's at the office
oh ok
lol
fedex takes them to the office now
because they're gay like that
fedex left it at my mailbox
orly
well you're lucky
:F
lol
i'd prefer them leave it at the office than my porch
twenty minutes til i have to leave again
today sucks
lol
anyways tony
the general rule of thumb is to get there an hour before your flight
^
especially in LV
and LA
in reno: not so much
the LV airport is pretty efficient
but if it's your first time there then yeah, you want to be early
yeah but it can still be a bitch if you get stuck in a shitty area
lol
a wednesday afternoon probably won't be too bad
probably not
on a non holiday
yeah
i'm excited :3
and that's news because i'm not usually excited for anything lol
lol
lol
an hour before my flight
which is at 8
ok
also that game turned out totally different than i wanted because i read the thingy and it said i HAD to have certain things that i was fudging a bit :F
lol
what did you have to change?
overall it turned out pretty cool
i'm trying to figure out how to connect to the ecc through putty so i can grab the gm file
then i can exe it
and send it through dropbox because gmail says nope
can you ssh to windows at the ecc?
idk, there's a remote desktop option on them, so maybe?
afaik it remote connects to linux
damn
well i'll grab it tomorrow on my flash drive and exe it for you guys
it's actually kinda fun
even then dropboxing something via ssh would probably be a real pain in the ass to do lol
you need two people on one keyboard though
yeah lol
sadly we werent allowed to do networking
i asked my prof
:F
it wouldnt have been hard to set up with such a simple game
this is the trend I see with networking
it is simple in theory and a pain in the ass to actually make it work
lol
yeah
i wanted to do it simply for control's sake
it's such a pain
lol
lol
you could make it use two gamepads
p1 controls are w,a,d,f,e,space
p2 controls are up,left,right,num0,num1,rctrl
i could
but we have no gamepads for the lab
so
lol
:U
egbert has a bunch of generic gamepads
like the one I used on my embedded game
yeah if egbert was teaching this class i would be much more happy lol
eelke is cool and all but really, he's so fucking distracted with his kid
eelke is really freaking tall
yes he is
lol
he gave his talk in our class today
i literally think that every time he stands up in class
the project: simulating vision impairment with an occulus rift
lol
saw that coming
lol
(get it)
(i SAW IT)
apparently that becomes a thumbs up
and ('LOL') turns into that face
without the ' of course
yes
how do you display the value of the node you're at in 2 b?
i have emojis disabled
you're emojiless
that was supposed to sound more like emotionless
but
you know
lol
val (pre left) (pre right)
oh right
val
i can't scroll with my mouse so i hadnt looked at the helper functions lol
you can't scroll with your mouse?
not in their editor
oh
lol
i dont use that
lol
yeah
edit in sublime, run via terminal
it's just convenient cause it has a "save and load" button
i just push up enter to load
lol
true
so
i am getting
Exception in car: () is not a pair
(define (preorder T)
 (val T)
 (preorder (left T))
 (preorder (right T))
)
now
i know that doesnt work
well that's missing some stuff
but why
lol
lol
yeah
i know
i need a null check, yeah?
it inf loops
and has no base case
yes
what do i make the thingy after the null check be?
(null? T) blah
it's calling val on ()
which caused that error
makes sense
(null? T) T
ohkay
i thought so
or (null? T) '()
but i'm fucking tired
lol
to be more explicit
(13 (5 (1 () ()) (8 () (9 () ())))
   (22 (17 () ()) (25 () ())))
is that correct output?
no
because if you just type T that's exactly what it would output
lol
it should look like it says in the assignment
oh
(13 5 1 8 9 22 17 25)
right
so i need to cons them all into a list
grand
i'd just use append
instead of cons
append to what?
return a list formed by append
like
scheme is so bad :( i dont like it
lol
(append (val) (left) (right))
oh
well
that's easy
see i wouldnt have thought of that
lol
but last night i would have
i'm off my game :(
so much :(
well, part C is really easy after you have B at least
I feel like my solution to the extra credit is 2x longer than it needs to be
okay so i did the append val left right thing and it returned a null list
code?
 (cond
   ((null? T) T)
   (append
     (val T)
     (preorder (left T))
     (preorder (right T))
   )
missing the else after the null check
wait
oh
yeah
thought there was also a paren issue but there isnt
because append isnt a condition?
that would make sense
honestly I'd think the else isnt needed
but that's the difference between mine and yours
Exception in append: 1 is not a proper list
(define (preorder T)
 (cond
   ((null? T) T)
   (else
     (append
       (val T)
       (preorder (left T))
       (preorder (right T))
     )
   )
 )
)
append expects to be given lists
gotta make val T be a list
with the list function
using... (list)
lol
lol
i still get all those parentheses
(13 (5 (1 () ()) (8 () (9 () ())))
   (22 (17 () ()) (25 () ())))
code
lol i promise the goal is not to have you do this for me :F
lol
(define (preorder T)
 (cond
   ((null? T) T)
   (else
     (append
       (list
         (val T)
         (preorder (left T))
         (preorder (right T))
       )
     )
   )
 )
)
oh hey
we should 1-1
lol
(sorry guys)
sure
also
taco time
you literally have what i have
shouldnt be making parens
it is :(
what's yours look like?
so what's the itenerary again?
and is laundry able to be done or should I pack for like... 5 days?
...guize
sorry

lol okey doke
except I won't be bringing a laptop but that works
well i mean we have things :P
you could hearthstone with me on alex's tablet haha
hi
hi
hiya
apm we should play hearthstone, Then I may finally win some games
vgh
lol
vgh
oh my god I just realized why they're called corndogs
because they're wrapped in CORNBREAD
gaaaad
hahaha
with dogs inside?
I hear hot dogs are made with real dogs
they're not
j/k
lol
hahaha
it's leftover scraps from other finer meats
Yeah I'd rather not know xD
lol
We have something similar here called a "frikandel speciaal" slice open with onions, mayo and curry type saus. http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/Frikandel_speciaal_met_verse_frieten.jpg
that actually looks kinda good
do you eat that with utensils, by hand, or with bread?
it is, just don't want to know what they make it out of :p
hahah
utensils yeah
Yeah it's curry ketchup what they put on it. You can also get it without the toppings
oh my god that sounds delicious
what's a "classic" meal over there and what's your favorite?
hmm well I'd say the frikandel with sideorder of fries may be the best quick fast food
that's fast food?
lol wow
But the traditional red cabbage, and potato mash with meatballs. Or a beef stew is also nice.
yeah xD
hmm
sounds hearty
it doesn't always look that good though
it is. It's great for the weather we get around here.
lol I believe that
classic meals consist of potatoes in one form or another, with some sort of vegetable and some meat
Potatoes are amazing so I'd be okay with that
Yeah. We eat anything here as long as it's not too spicy or seasoned. I don't mind either.
I imagine spice would be preferred?
Some spices but little pepper, no too much garlic, and nothing with too strong of a taste.
._. is it just... not preferred?
I grew up with all kinds of different foods so it has never been a problem. I think so, can't be sure why though.
Maybe it's tradition
tradition may not be the right word
We have a saying: What the farmer doesn't know, he won't eat. (literal)
ahah
spices mean random elements which have untraceable origin?
nah not really, hold on
?
sorry lol
I'm not sure if I understand what you mean
What the farmer doesn't know, he won't eat
trying to disseminate from that
well if you haven't tried something, you may be less inclined to try it
in the future
But I'm refering more to the taste
ahah
If it's a strong taste they'll be less inclined to even consider it
What's the food like overthere? Any traditional dishes?
the most traditional I can think of is...
Breakfast: Bacon and eggs with toast (toast can come with butter and jam, or both)
xD
And it's either Steak or a Burger. Red meat regardless
Steak and potatoes and/or Cheeseburger with fries
Surely the region has many mexican influences?
Southwest does, oh yeah
ah
pretty much the entire southwestern area is more attuned to that taste
I dunno states are like their own countries in relation to Europe
Can't tell you the "nevadan" dish but I can tell you regions
The further Southeast you go, the more likely you are to find Fried Chicken, Mac N' Cheese and Grits
The legends be true :O
That's cool I suppose
I guess each country has it's food unflences
yeah
Apparently the farther east you go the more likely it is that one prefers Hot dogs to Hamburgers
i dunno
haven't really explored my own country >_<
lol
it's huge so it wouldn't surprise me :p
compared to this lil speck
yeah... I need to travel more lol
so do I :/
sadly everything is getting more expensive each year
yeeaaaah
Time to land a million dollar contract :P
roit?
xD
shame the plane expert has class >_<
I have questions
lol
I do know a 90% pilot/airline mechanic but he's at work
lol I just have a question about carryon
crosses over the size limit
but it can be squished down to fit
ah like that
yeh
sorry plane-travelling
what are you flying with?
southwest? :P
yeah
lool
For a while they had a tv show, mstly about southwest showing here.
??
A tv show on experiences with southwest http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline_(U.S._TV_series)
was it about the daily goings-ons?
huh
oh neat
yeah that's a 20 min episode but agter 20 seconds you'll get an impression
lol yeah no joke
huh
neat
hahaha
smells too bad to board the plane
lol gaaaaawd
lol already the race card
All the bad through the tv xD
jesus
lol the documentation is racist
gaaaaaaaaaaaaawd
I feel for these people
xD I'm guessing these are just the good parts worthy of tv
it's like Retail for plane
goood
international retail as opposed to localized
this enrages me lol so much
yup
So far my flying experiences have been great
same
Check the fine print on the southwest website :P
Checked the dimensions
extends one of those dimensions by a half inch
but it can be squished down 2 inches under
clothing is squishy
I've broken a sweat trying to get my bag in the overhead bin https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pofUsd9hEi8
Had this play out in my head
lol oh dear
should be fine
should be
phone lady is helpful
"yeah you'll be fine"
woo
xD
not sarcastic^
she sounded so pleasan
I can only imagine the hell she goes through
ah cool, did you record it?
lol nope
evidence, smart man
yeah they get alot of crap
on the otherhand not sure if there are any US wiretap laws
or if this falls under that
well
the government kinda wiretaps us anyway
yeah
lol good god
"Well bending is better than breaking it, isn't it? I mean ppl who put cellphones on the back pocket and seat they should expect something would break but Apple gave customers the 2nd chance i guess" - on the phones bending
" ppl who put cellphones on the back pocket and seat they should expect something would break"
not a single other phone and/or object has done that
ugh
lololol
For this reason it's never in my backpocket
lol
oh wait you got an iphone?
nah but any smartphone
lol
no other smartphone does that though
with the size they are these days, backpocket seems unpractical
true :p
lol yeah
i dont' just because doing it for long periods of time will unbalance your spine
pickpockets, biking and paranoia of cracking the screen
lol
all good reasons to not put things in back pocket
hmm
that is adorable
indeed
hi
hi
your carry on should be fine as long as it isnt huge
nah it's not
no sketchbook though
that would make it non squishable
lol
ok 3 jeans for 5 days
.....technically 4
i think i can do
i dunno
skype y u no send messages

buh
heart is pounding
flights make me nervous
lol
they are fun though
I:
just remember the pilot has tens of thousands of hours of experience and makes multiple flights per day like it's nothing
roit
i know i know
the technology is amazing and constantly improving and the statistics are beyond optimal
still afraid
ok well about to head out
see you folks in a bit
there's a cool app called "i'm flying, hold my hand" (or that's what it was called) that has tons of facts and stuff to reassure you that flying is both okay and a technologically sound part of the future
and safe
i forgot safe
lol
lol
so
plan for tonight
i'm thinking we probably grab tony and grab food somewhere near where alex works
because she gets off at 10
and that's convenient
lol

cool beanz
what do we want for food?
chipotle isnt REALLY mexican
lol

apos?
wat
it has a bit of markup in it
apos is probably a markup tag
lol
^
ss = smiley face
dunno what apos is
"wut"
hahaha
i'll make better word clouds for us without markup later
missing swastikas, not accurate
^
99% sure LOL/lol is going to be my #1 word without markup
99% sure its going to be us all
lol, wut, wat
yes. lol
Oh and yes and no
and "oh"
i can make markov bots for each of us
we need to add them to this chat somehow
lol
if you hed a server to use you probably could set that up
separate accounts for each bot, add them to chat, etc.
or one account and just have them preface every statement with their name, ex. "DUCKBOT: LOL WAT
                 "MEZBOT: I KNOW RIGHT DUDE THATS SO FUNNY"
Mezalyth is cool.
HE IS, i KNOWWW DUDE
all of us say "lol" most often by far
You should delete it as a statistical outlyer
Also would you guys like the link to my kerbal mod pack?
i'd love to but i'm honestly not going to have time for quite a while :F
home
sweet
how was the flight?
smoother than last one
also as we were about to take off they were like "OH RIGHT SEATBELTS AND SAFETY FFFFUUUUUU"
long day for them apparently
weird being back home
lol
reno is so nice
come join us here :P
I'd like to but $900 for an apt. is beyond my budget
only 450 if you joined brandon haha
also, if you're legit thinking about it, i'm sure i could find you a place with roommates to help bear the load
if you
?
lol if he'd tolerate me
sorry, pressed enter rather than things
lol
hah
oh, do you guys mind if I tag you?
I'm totally off the grid social network wise, and alex would enjoy it
so go ahead lol
lol
typing while leaning super far over because tired seems to be affecting my need to edit
lol
lol
ahah
we've gotta stop saying lol
HAHA
INDEEd
:F
was gonna put lol after that
kek?
maybe just get the machines to ignore that
haha yeah, that'd be better
"lol"
i would tolerate you mez :p
but this is also my last year in reno
righto
it really was a good way to reset our sleep schedules lol]
i woke up 30 mins before my alarm
lol I woke up at 8:30
this is fascinating
also apparently WT covered Radioactive by Imagine Dragons
they covered a few
they're all on youtube

o_O
Krash sent me a steam game gift

"Son, I saw this computer video machine game in the oven and remembered how much you love waffles. One day we'll build a house out of waffles and live there FOREVER. Over n' Out, Dad"
lol
mez your scorpions are my bees
every insect i see or hear: might be a bee :F
lol
I don't have insects :D
Or arachnids
WAT
Some guy just posted on our class website asking for more homework
who the hell does that
"That" guy does
There is always "that" guy
ALWAYS
....what
lol
seriously what
lol
what class?
AI
lol
that does not sound like a class i'd want homwork in
lol
we currently have 0 homework
and i can't see him deciding to give homework either
that sounds wonderful
grading it would just be too much work
can he teach 301pls
my guess is the guy who asked for more HW also knew this and is just a suck up trying to look like an over achiever
kek
Doing 10/10 job in KSP
<<< Now you know how it is living in the tropics, I sleep better in the Netherlands.
lol
May have to move to the Netherlands
xD
All we have here are silverfish, mosquitoes and harmless spiders. As far as i've seen.
...
Well at least I do't have to check all around my bed and curtains to see if there's a centipede (scolopendra gigantea)
Not the tiny house spider centipede things, the big omg is that a baby snake with fangs?!
I:
and legs
yeah no
yeah
ok work
good luck with your nonsnakes D:
lol none here :[
cya
tonyyyy
tony won kenobi
brandooooooo
hi
Darth Brando
i dunno
sup
do you have a resource for good tiling web background images?
I have one but I can't access it from this computer
subtlepatterns
aha! exactly what I was looking for
thanks :D
anytime
you can also preview them
and most come in 2 sizes
"Stardust" is what scybreak uses
if ya wanna be cool
lol
Think I should avoid using Roboto since everyone uses it?
yeah
Roboto is from Google and DESIGNED for web
like Raleway
As long as you stay away from Bleeding Cowboys and Lobster, you should be fine as well
unless no one knows design there
in which caswe use Lobster
lol
So, do or don't use Roboto then?
eh, why not
(Slab is better)
lol
Might I also suggest Oswald or Lato?
oooh
Ubuntu font
I think I've used Ubuntu before
i like it
very modern but still readable
ooh the italic is gorgeous
it would fit in since this is an app for submitting code
and ubuntu is where a lot of people code
lol Ubuntu would be a nice in-joke
pluse it looks more techy
(Lobster would be too playful for school... or so playful that people wouldn't think it's sophisticated)
i have a professor who uses comic sans
I: Come on guy at least use Comic Neue
my god: https://i.imgur.com/ko77lnO.jpg
lol
as with all of my designs, it is totally lacking any color:
clean
dig it
i think it should be less bland though
having to visit that page every week atfer a long programming assignment would just feel yucky
alternate text would be a light serif font to mix it up
lol
you can have the dark background with neon colors
Tron style
alternatively: UNRs colors
i was thinking there could be a colorful border between the dark/light
UNR color is just blue lol
i'm bad with blues
lol
might work well to kind of keep the UNR theme
I've also noticed that UNR likes to use images of the campus as backgrounds
they change the image every few months to match the season
that'll do
and that's cool
ok so
i was told I'd have files for a 24 hour turnaround time
within the hour
2 hours ago >_>
what do
maybe they went to lunch
true
oh, so
when do you want to visit originate?
thursday or friday?
also: http://i.imgur.com/izRP2Is.png
that's cool
er
it's this coming weekend right?
yeah
i fly down wednesday evening
is one preferred?
lol awesome
thursday is the show
but thats at like 7 or 8
that's the free one right?
it was like $12
ok easy
i already have tickets
lol
I saw the nightwish one and that kinda blew my budget :X
lol
i also already have nightwish tickets
lol
jeeeeeeze
doesn't surprise me
anyways, thursday before the show would probably be best
oh also apparently my bro has had 2 interviews to work at Switch already
as a fabricator type guy welding steel and stuff in their data center
Switch owns the building Originate is in
he had no clue until he casually mentioned he had 2 interviews at Switch to my mom
oh nice
I made a pie today
nao that site looks so good compared to the old one, there's no way it needs more stuff lol
lol
also i liked the simple layout
it made it so i wasnt distracted and just got straight to the project at hand
keep the fancy good looking stuff to the editor
What website?
that
o
I made an avacado pie, by the way
that sounds savoury
jesus christ
lol
impressive treefarm
works on pretty much every tree
ian is the new war thunder patch out?
Not yet
ok
I assume its coming this week or the first part of next week
i saw some videos of it and thought it might be, but i guess it was just dev server
the rear-prop japanese plane looks OP as fuck
in arcade at least
I hope its great
it pulled a 12G turn at something like 100m from the ground, going around 550km/h
in arcade
maybe slight exaggeration but it pulled a crazy turn without losing altitude or much speed
and its cannon 4-shots b-17's
It seems like it will retain its energy great
The real question is how will it be in realistic
that is the question
vague assignments are the devil
egbert 101
sengupta 101
badhw 101
i keep ending these lines of python with semicolons
technically not WRONG, but not right either
lol
my tongue hurts
too many sour patch kids
lol
y he only give 1 week to do this
and it HAD to be the week where I am gone for 4/7 days
yeah that is unfortunate
woo finished the first of the 3 parts of this assignment
andrewww
androooo
Andy-rooo
hi
just texted you back
lol
lol
tanks
yep
so the vagueness of this project has me blocked
because it is possible, under the description of this system, to come in to undefined behavior as taught in our lecture slides
and I don't know how to handle that
microsoft is bad at numbers
xbox -> xbox 360 -> xbox one, windows 7 -> windows 8 -> windows 10
they're skipping to 10/
?
lol
yes
wow
gg
why
who knows
Windows 8.1 is 9
Therefore
but 8.1 is 8.1
But also 9
So 10
but 8.1 != 9
That statement is true
Though numerically not 9
it is functionally 9
no because the transition from 8 to 9 would be a major release but 8 to 8.1 wasn't a major release
if it was a major release it would be called 9
it would have a whole number's worth of updatedness
not just 1/10 of a number's worth
Maybe Bill Gates doesn't like 9?
Maybe
They know
Every other version (sequencially) of windows sucks
7 is nice
So, they skipped to the next bad one
So they could lower expectations
No no
Ever other version
9 was supposed to be good based on the past pattern
Yes
xp good, vista bad, 7 good, 8 bad
That's what I mean
They skipped to the next bad one
To save time on dev and QA
but then how does xbox one fit in to this?
Its how much is left in your wallet after you pay for xbox gold and the console.
lol
I'm gonna see if I can figure out the average number of messages this chat received per day from the logs on my laptop
our group chat has 66573 messages according to my laptop's logs
which is slightly low, since I haven't used my laptop much in the past 4 months
That is a tidy sum
yep
oh actually that wasy waay low
it really has 119121 messages
first message was on 7/28/ at 9 pm
that means we have an average of 150 messages per day
that's pretty good
if you average the messages at 4 words per, that's 600 words per day
we're quite the talkative bunch even with a bunch of lol's and wats
4 is the average according to my logs over the past 4 months
(i'm psychic)
lol
(either that or i hacked your logs)
well i mean you have the same log file
so
lol
hey man, aint nobody got time to figure out how to see that
lol
i got time for that
apparently
!!! today our chat is 2 years 2 months 2 days old
if you want, we have some dipping bread that's extra and we're not gonna finish it
222!
222~
half life 3 confirmed!
so you could come help
lol
2+2+2=6
6/2?
222/2 = 111, 1+1+1 = 3, half life 3
anyway, yeah, bread if you want it brando
hmmmmmmmmmm
nah
I want bread
gotta do dishes then sleep
lol
k
bread is good
so is garlic olive oil with a pesto dipping bread seasoning mix
yummy yummy
Don't forget the oregano!
i have figured out what percentage of total messages we each have contributed
Oh?
In order max to min: Me, mez, deco, apm, m31, ment, courney
Makes sense
lol
Can you provide the actual percentages?
Please use significant figures
0.312, 0.226, 0.192, 0.158, 0.079, 0.025, 0.007 respectively
lol @ that .007
lol
I might just make a program to get and visualize all of these statistics
i still think it'd be fun to make markov bots for each of us
Do it
(and then give it to me, I won't abuse it, I swear)
lol
i bet the bots will end everything with "lol"
lol
That is my guess as well
Will the bots talk to each other?
they could
i'd probably just find a generic markov bot instead of make my own
and just feed them our messages
but that wouldnt be as cool
yeah well I am busy with homework and senior project :F
lol
i'm still trying to figure out the friggin pins and stuff on this arduino
i'm so bad with hardware its ridiculous
lol
like really, this class makes like -.0001% sense
didn't you have a test in that class today?
practice midterm
ah
i saw them as I was leaving that room
gotcha
suddenly
an entirely different direction
I wonder if they skipped Windows 9 because of 95/98
Andrew I am test flying the J7W1 on the dev server
andrew i picked up your prog lang homework he handed back today
looks fun "sarcasm
yeah saw that
suicide fistival
ohai
hi
how was the plane (iancosun) and thanks for grabbing the hw (branaodon)
i lost 3 points but you did the same thing and didnt lose any :(
It did not respond well to mouse only controls but it did very well to bound controls
lolwat
yeah deco thats what it looked like in the videos i saw as well
his grader docked me points for using append with 3 args
append accepts 2 or more args though
soo :F
well then i'd go punch the grader
lol
i'm gonna ask him about it next week
god I am starving
me3
i just ate a hot pocket and a french bread pizza
still starving
lol
i just ate some cookies that are like a month old
still delicious
i have brownies
are they special?
yes <3 made my my love
she put an insane amount of pot in them
MY, MY, MISS AMERICAN BROWNIE
i meant chocolate
lol
potcolate
omw andrew
h'okay
does anyone know wtf ello is
makes sense I guess
what is ello?
i have no idea lol
lol
ooook
must do something
what do
I:
learn to hearthstone with me :P
maybe
it's FUUUUUN
lol
it'd be cool if it was in-browser.
I've just had three games in a row where it came down to the wire and I pulled out the victory
it would
downloading.
we'll see
I beat a guy down from 27 health, all while he had me at 1 health. so. much. scare.
lol
he was quite pissed when i beat him
what's your battle.net tag thingy?
probably mezalyth
i dunno if i have one
it should have four numbers after it
like: mezalyth#1235
wat
that's weird
its so you can talk to people you just played, but you cant spam them with invites without the number
I had some of my avocado pie
It was amazing
is it sweet or what? I can't imagine an avacado pie other than some kind of chip-dip thing
Its sweet
lol, do you have a pseudorecipe to throw out so i can imagine the flavour?
Mezalyth
that's what it is
que nombres?
actually, just add me
apmenard1993#1124
doing tutorial
request sent
oh
i'm 1781
Mezalyth#1781
lol cool. imma hop in mumble if you want to join me
er k
should i go through the tutorial or nah?
yes for sure
lol i've only gone through the 1st figh tlol
i have a while
yeah, once you get the hang of it the tutorial doesnt take long though
lol gonna be a smidge sorry
no problem. still in mumble if you want tips :P
seems fairly straightforward
i can hop on mumble for idle chitchat though if ya want
i like all the little details
i will say that
the mana counter and the history are neat
yeah, when you get fully into it they have deck trackers and stuff too, so you can see what cards you have left in your deck
lol jeeze
not illegal by blizzard standards because you could do it on pen and paper as well
hmm
is there a max number of cards you can have in yoru deck?
the only thing that kinda disappoints me about this game is there aren't TOO many cards, so you see a lot of the same 10 or so deck setups, with a few oddball cards
ahah
have they ever added more?
they're releasing a 100 card expansion soon that will totally render that statement moot, and they just added an expansion (20 bucks, but you CAN get it with just in game money)
......hrm
ok
yep
a lot of the streamers and things did free to play runs of the game, where they unlocked all that with ingame money and it didnt take them too long
lol ok
just lost my first match in a while
sadface
had the guy at seven health and he barely managed to clear my minions and keep from death
lucky draws by him, but you know. it is a card game after all lol
lol jeeeeze
you hopping on mumble anytime soon? i'm lonleh :P
ok ok
tonyyy
brandoooooooooooo
oh
when is things tomorrow
I get off work like 10:30 on a good day
11:30 on a bad day
first: originate tomorrow or friday?
we can do tomorrow but depending on time
friday may be better
i imagine people are more relaxed anyways
its a very relaxed place lol
but friday after the programmer lunch would probably be best
cool
im down
would you mind printing the delain tickets?
nope
Brandron
Can you tell me the google?
the google
the google
my laptop is terrible. taking forever to open the delain ticket info
lol
it took a solid 5 minutes for it to realize i plugged in a mouse
doing my programming HW on this is going to be hell
oh
apparently we just bring the order confirmation number to the box office before the show
040600011703, for the record
@_@
lol ok
link for tickets btw?
^
we just tell them that number
at the box office
no i mean how do i get MY tickets
^
that's for both
I already bought two
lol
OH snap ._.
lol thank you sir
ok
lol
wow my laptop CPU is 90* celcius
that's bad
._.
wat
[9:08:36 PM] naosyth.: lol
Why does it say Nao now
laptop
ahhhh
brb, gonna blow out my laptop w/ compressed air
temp dropped from 95 C to around 45 C
test
is my name still naosyth?
dunno
i still see brandon
I see nao still
lol
now?
i see brandon now
Fixed
woo
it said naosyth.
now it is brandon woirl
woirl!
this laptop sucks balls
my VM froze
gg
at least it didn't corrupt when i powered it down
kek
so
apparently i bought 3 tickets
lol
does mai want to go?
lol gg
o.o
lol yeah
yeah as in she does?
or yeah as in gg
lol
yeah she does
ok
so, I'll ask around tomorrow and see if Rob, the guy you met at the career fair, will be there on Friday
cool
thank you
sucks when you kinda have to go to sleep but you don't really want to -_-
lol
oh also the concert tomorrow is at 8 but we'll want to show up early
also they sell food there if we want to eat there
it's like bar food stuff
kinda
oh neat
whar be located
also, when?
like eta?
425 Fremont Street Las Vegas, NV 89101
eas
y
as in how early do we want to be?
yeah
mai gets off at ~5:30
ish
we should get there around an hour early
ok
wooo got another one of those 3 programs finished
it's amazing how much easier doing this is today than it was yesterday. sometimes you just aren't in the mood to think programatically i guess
nice
plus doing it a day or two after initially looking at it makes it much easier to get down right the first time
yeah
still, looking at what I was doing yesterday just looks stupid now
lol
I was storing a ton of packet state info on the sender instead of on the packets themselves
which just doesn't make sense
moving all of that logic out to the packet made it so much cleaner
nice
x_X
a normal sleep schedule
is what i want for my birthday
lol
something I like about hearthstone: easy to watch netflix on the side
o/
\o
after cleaning up my laptop a little bit it is once again actually usable
and it is about 60*F cooler from blowing it out so I can type without sweaty hands!
hah that's better
I'm working on making markov bots based on this chat
oh dear
take out the lol
i found a good markov bot python script i can modify for our needs
now i just need to make a script to clean up our messages to remove markup tags and such
yay message cleaner works
removes all links, removes smiley formatting (but keeps the smiley text), replaces stuff like " with ", and removes a bit of other skype related markup
nice
also Rob won't be at the vegas office this week
still want to check out the office anyways?
yeah i'm down
okie
tony, when should we leave for the concert if we want to get there at like 7ish?
also my bot got banned from this irc test room apparently
lol
great
well I asked Mai to be ready by 6:30
so we'll probably be leaving around that time
not gonna be on the dot though if that's ok
yeh
so, i have a naosyth bot on irc
this bot is a retard though
y so retard?
it makes no sense lol
want to try talking to it?
i can
click server and network and type in irc.betaforce.com
for the channel do #naosyth
server?
server is irc.betaforce.com
oh i didn't see server
so tiny
lol
port?
default, 6667
Did someone say bot?
lol
main supplies god for single any minecraft guys
can people temple
ruinn back, dont
Its dead
test
again was still
yes
dat bot tho
lol
so bad
3 bad
i'm not entirely surprised at its speech patterns though
we do say some weird ass things on this chat
in multiple messages as well
hooopadoopa
Andrew
D.521
nice
seems like what i'll be doing tonight. lol
It starts tomorrow
aww
well i know what i'm probably not doing lol
I want the plane
lol
me too
It goes until monday morning it seems
interesting
lots of chances for money as well
i like
As do I
Especially with the update fast approaching
I'm trying out a different bot just to test out my input file
this bot is taking significantly longer to process the input file
input file issues?
no
they said this bot took a few hours to process War & Peace
which I'm guessing is longer than the collection of my chat messages
...hm
so this new bot speaks in very long sentences
.....yay?
>'hello' 
the general idea how to go insane In regard to fix it ...
>'how are you'
the turtle heads lol i think he doesn't listen to be turtle tail fin off,
well I mean if you count only the messages where we do this to experiment with the sometimes buggy pencil that skype has for symbolizing that someone is writing then it works pretty well for that, but if you include the fact that most of the time we post things in multiple lines
then it's not that impressive
but that doesn't matter for a markov bot
well maybe it does i guess
the turtle heads lol
The vast majority of my input messages are in the form of complete thoughts per line
inb4 "these bots suck" *nao writes own bot*
markov bots in general are pretty bad at actually making sense
laser is just generally awesome then?
laser makes a lot of nonsense too
but he fools people
lol
he fools people like connorelilego12
that isn't hard
>'so how are you?'
the fall with crappy internet dies when i still so we just imagine being a few,
>'hmmm very interesting'
the house later how tall .....
>'what house?'
the fox say something lol two of the book,
>'what does the fox say?'
the lag Right as a few random people and dress shoes would be fast enough to get a laptop and take over night dedicated energy cells and stuff?
>'take over the night? sounds ambitious'
the one too then they looked cool yes no clue how we destroyed their profile layouts?
>'why would you destroy their profile layouts?'
farm takes 3 seconds and a park without any difference between dead indeed i just say....
>'it takes a dead park?!'
green wait that movie before when it is the amount of iron farms possibly preferably not needed but 0 lol it is the teacher knows how much is a few problems left And also we should man that is getting internet has another that isn't that was gonna see what?
you can tell he was taught by someone who plays minecraft
lol
ok
andrew alive?
also...wonder if we can just troll that age group
watching league videos while I play hearthstone
hmmm
wassup
delain says concert is at 7 on FB, the LVCS website says it is at 8
wait what
wat
um
what do the tickets say
there are no tickets
you give them that number at the door
. . .
roit
uh
are there comments to this?
i left a comment asking what time the show was since it says 2 different times
no reply yet though
link? and are there multiple sources?
2nd post
its Delain/Xandria?
yea
poster says 8pm
fb event says 8pm
fb says 7 for me
erk?
i think it's 8 and someone in Delain hasn't set a watch or something
this is the one i was looking at:
8 is probably correct
I:
they also just got in town from the look of their singer's FB page
like a few minutes ago
yeah...
also every other upcoming show at LVCS is at 8pm
so yeah, probably 8
yeah lol
maybe it actually does start at 7
but everyone else keeps Delain them.
Doctors - Mez is hilarious
>_<
lol
i can't think of any way to turn "xandria" in to a counter pun
xandria...
hm
hmmmm
blerghhaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhnope https://i.imgur.com/lUmqKV8.jpg
lol
did you see the full video?
stillj, recluse + widow =  NOOOOOPE
i didnt see the full video
he's explaining how they only bite when threatened
nope.exe
some spider ama thingy
lol
his hand is submerged because they kept crawling up his arm
i figured it was in preparation for the flame thrower
lol
so, if you see a brown recluse, smash it in to 10000000 pieces instead of spraying it with bug spray
yeah
"cause it to go mad and aggressive"
fuck that
lol
ready to head out in 15?
and do you have the conf #?
yep
i will pull it up on my phone
what's it again?
just in case?
040600011703
i forwarded the email to you too just now
did you want me to print anything?
nah, it's on my phone and on my phone's clipboard incase i don't have data access
cool
and thank you sir
food's on me
you sure? you don't have to lol
you got us freakin tickets
and you eat like a bird
it's no problem lol
lol
ok headed over in a jiffy
ok
good lord deco did you see the new russian dual 57mm cannon tank?
two 57mm autocannons
8 rounds in four volleys per ammo-rack
yUP
*Yup
Thats a lot
i'm just sad there's not an option to shoot each barrel individually
at-at style
did you try out the ho-229 on the dev server?
Yes
It is a graceful beast
with poor yaw control
well that's kinda expected lol
imagine flying THAT through bridges, buildings, etc
I don't want to try it
lol
It holds energy so well
I want to try it :P
"Soon"
I'm going to guess Tuesday
because that's apparently when PS4 pushes updates
and they have to be in sync with that now
right
cool
Then I have to quickly research the J7W1, Venom, and Ho.229
lol
good luck
J7W1 is 120k, Ho.229 is 220k and the Venom is 320k (ouch)
wow
yeah, ouch
lol
First two are not so bad
Last....
ouch
Good thing I like the Vampire
lol
The Vampire is great, it just requires a little.... spooling up
Its like a train it has to build up momentum
lol that's what i've heard
Once its at speed its better than all its opponents though
and like that my lseep schedule is wonky
lol
What did you do mez
went to a Delain/Xandria/5othershittybands concert
Sounds like a good time though... Can't even remember when I went to a concert last... All I remember was it was stageside for my favorite band at the time, though they are still one of my favorites
that's legit
who?
Styx
they're awesome
One of the few bands that are better love than on album imo
Live
lol
I truly don't understand how these things win
lol
a master piece
also sorry about killing your sleep schedule
lol
lol no worries
do i have time to shower before the thingymajig
yes because i too need to shower and I just woke up
hahah brilliant
okey doke
done showering and stuff
lol like half the office is WFH today
wfh?
oh
lol
lol
worth the visit then?
yeah
originate shirt or no
your call lol
i'd say no
because i'm not even wearing one
but yeah, worth going because at least one of them showed up only because I was gonna come in
on nice ok hahah
when should we depart?
I'm ready now
ok lemme put clothes on and grab business cards
you won't need clothes
did i forget to mention that it is a nudist office?
but where do you suggest i stash my cards?
hmmm
don't answer that
behind the ear!
lol headed over
I think you are allowed a should/hip bag
is that a sigh of relief he breathes?
also, news on sleeping bag?
no response yet
test
y m tired
you need to ingest several pounds of sugary candy
or shoot up some adrenalin/caffeine cocktail
lol
headshot
that looks like it'd hurt in the morning
and for several weeks after that too
lol
you even hear the crowd go "ooooooh"
So legendary soul singer Gladys Knight asked me for my avocado pie recipe today
1) how did you get her to eat your pie
2) who is that
oh damn sone well done
It was avocado pie
yes i know
we all know
answers?
Oh

And thanks

Yeah, it was just a check up

you should open deco and suns, an avacado pie store
lol
Deco & Sons
Deco needs sons to be Deco & Sons
We had a gentleman's apparel store called Deco & Sons
wish I could find the logo again
that sign was amazing
haha
Deco could do gentlemans apparel too
oh tony, my mom said that if whatever you needed sewed was small she could just do it for you
that might be better
ok cool
question is do i want new pant decor or a cloak
she just got a new sewing machine because the last time she lent the old one out (to my bro) it came back less functional
oh hah ok
but that's typical of anything my brother touches
lol
how did your bro hurt a sewing machine?
i dont even know
those are near indistructable
he managed somehow
this is how bad he is:
he was driving to burningman
one of his wheels passed him on the road
(while they were still driving)
pssssshhhhh
. . .
wheres a mountie when you need them -_-
taht sounds about right
he was hauling a trailer literally packed with explosive materials at the time
uhhhh
kay
apparently foo fighters will be at life is beautiful
yes

hello android

android
lol
Tony
This one?
lol
YEEESSS
Die commies
the right side of those ships weren't finished though
yeah, it was just a test
lol
the dude is a beast though, he comes up with the coolest things
lol
"At the moment, blueprints can be used only in creative mode, but later in the future they will be added for survival as well. Welders (both ship and character) will be able to 'place' blocks according to blueprints."
it sounds like you wont even need an assembly line with the final blueprint implimentation
incoming massive mass production shipyards
^
Much needed

decobot.exe has encountered a fatal error and the program will now terminate
beep bop
would you like to report this error to Microsoft?
>no
error reporter is not responding
>cmd
>taskkill -IM decobot.exe
*clippy appears* "I see you're trying to kill decobot, would you like some help with that?"
A FATE WORSE THEN DEATH
lol
i think that might be the funniest virus of all time
somebody writes a clippy that tries to help you delete the virus, which is clippy
oh my god
"I see you're trying to remove me. How can I help?"
BY DYING YOU DREADFUL THING
i like clippy
no you don't
no i do
no one likes clippy
i like clippy
I like clippy as well
clippy is fun
and he's that one guy that always tries to help
so
you know
he's got that going for him
Stalin has a special place in hell for you two <.<
clippy will help us escape
"I see you're trying to escape from hell. Can I help you kill stalin on your way out?"
hahaha
xD
I hated clippy
well Clippy loved you
and only wanted to help you and see you succeed
oh yeah? how come he always gave me bad info??
he tried his hardest
nah he was a no good frenemie
Trying you hardest is worth nothing if you do not succeed
^this
So an earthquake woke me up just now
That's fun
so it IS south
woof
woof
meow
meow
bang
greetings fellow people of earth
and ian
My greetings
How are things at your end of the world?
Getting colder, but overall alright. No ebola or IS yet
Busy busy :p
Everything ok overthere?
well there's 1 ebola but it's still relatively far away from me, so for the most part, yeah :p
We've had one actually, but apparently it wasn't ebola, just malaria
one guy just had to go swimming in an ebola patient's fluids
spoon
spoon!
lol
fork
andrew texted me to say his class was out and I replied "mine will be spoon"
stupid swype
i was resisting giggling so hard
lol
my only reply was "spoon" so he would have burst out laughing if he didnt save reading that text til he was out of class
i was worried you'd tell me to hurry the fork up or something
That wouldn't have been very knife.
don't make me call mr. spork, he'll logic the fork out of you
Don't put too much on his plate he has a lot to deal with
yeah that sounds about right, I asked him if we were friends and he said don't put a ladel on it, so he must have been pretty distracted
well maybe salad spinner
I didnt get that one
lol
that's because there was nothing to get
way to be a blender (buzzkill)
pulling the plug on these puns
sup peeps
hai
yeah i tried to come up with a pun
lol
nope
spoon
i'm trying to either turn my netbook or raspPi into a cctv system so i can spy on these maintenance people tomorrow
not because I really think they will do anything but because this sounds fun
lol
[1:13:30 PM] Brandon Worl: greetings fellow people of earth
[1:13:37 PM] Brandon Worl: and ian
Wut you tryin' to imply there <.<
lol
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) <(Nothing at all, Ian.)
lol
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) <(Andrew, I am not a fan of these implications)
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) <(No reason to fear, Ian. These implications are completely harmless)
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) <(Clearly, since they are not entirely inaccurate)
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) <(That kind of denial leads to the destruction of your race, if not handled carefully.)
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) <(Be careful, Ian of the DecoSun. We do not take kindly to otherworldly beings here.)
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) <(It matters not, for I have already completed my mission)
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) <(The allegations have been confirmed, send in the troops.)
I:
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) <(Your troops are already dead, that was a part of my mission)
._.
lol
nao
saw that
the print resolution is pretty bad though
top secret security camera is working \o/
lol?
it detects motion and starts recordinf if motion is found, and saves the video remotely. I can also watch a live stream, and have it notify me by sms or email if it detects motion
neat
and it was all free as opposed to my parent's expensive CCTV system
although theirs is a little nicer
lol
lol
thats awesome
so when i break in tonight it'll record me doing funny dances in your kitchen?
i could point you to a url to view it but that would be creepy
kitchen isn't really in view of the camera
aww
kitchen is where the juice is
it can see my door/patio/computer though
what is the camera on?
ie what camera are you using?
netbook's webcam
didnt feel like having to move my desktop's webcam around
gotcha. funnily enough it's probably the same or better quaity than some "standard" security systems installed in stores and stuff
their cameras are shit
lol
well
they're not that bad
my parent's cameras are a bit higher resolution and have infared vision
but you can't keep thousands of hours of hq video sitting around without running out of space
infared would be cool
could pick up mice and things in the night lol
yeah I have HW to do so I didn't bother making it clean up after itself yet lol
lol inb4 full hard drive from random motion detection
it only records if it detects motion though
and it has a threshold for determining if it is significant motion or not
so if i move really, really slowly it wont pick me up?
probably
lol
lol that would be so fun to try and get around
haha
we could both set up camera systems on our door or something and give each other a key, and we had to sneak in and do something funny without the camera picking us up, or we lose
the netbook is disguised as a grocery bag. lol
O.o how'd you do that? lol
is it noticable?
lol at the hole
totally suspicious if you're looking for it
XD what
i thought it was an internal camer
isn't it great?
lol
er external
didn't know it was internal
haha
lol that's awesome
yeah. the whole netbook had to be hidden
lol
you need to steal gaffa and put your netbook inside his chest, much less conspicuous
haha
that isn't a bad idea
make his eyes actually see
that's what it sees
not bad
could totally avoid the camera's detection if I REALLY wanted to I bet
lol
especially once you get past opening the door
i'm not sure you could open the door without it noticing
yeah, but after that you can crawl past the camera
but yeah, you could totally just crawl around
lol
lol
welp, no more fun cctv experimenting. time for no fun boring homework
if it makes you feel better i've been doing linear algebra since 7
Tony: Remember Typhuse? from T2
errrr
slightly
sounds damn familiar
Remember Naosyth that's not Naosyth?
he randomly messaged me on reddit and added me on steam
He was in NOS iirc
was he?
i think so
he made that in game server side particle editor gui
oh snap
among other things
it does sound damn familiar
like insanely familiar
he was also kinda weird though
how goes the hws brandone
fin
now i am eat, because i forgot i have to eat
lol I forgot as well
i had some sprite while doing linear algebra but that is not food
i'm eating a single slice of french bread pizza
because that's about all i have
o.O
other than asian food which i am too lazy to make
ah
lol
i really need to go to winco lol
we have shittons of leftovers that are questionably still good, but I don't want to sift through my fridge to find something
i have lunch meat but no cheese and no bread
makes making sandwiches hard
or easy, i guess
lol do you have tortillas?
nope
i have seaweed though
that probably wouldnt be bad, actually
lol
well tomorrow i can survive off of del taco
so i can postpone winco till wednesday
lol yay taco tuesday
so, the Flash season premier is tomorrow
i saw that
kinda exciting
isnt arrow the 9th or something?
8th i think
sweet
i have a whole bag of chicken sticks
....ugh, fucking... 5:30 AM is going to wreck me
sorry for makigng you stay up late
lol not you
relational things
no definitely me
lol
you and your damn chicken strips
the concert, man
never forget
oh HAH no
hell naw
that wasn't even part of it lol
it is always part of it
nah
yes, because you just replied about it instead of sleeping
sh
Hi Mez
D: hi Ment
So I'm looking at those 75 iconic photos: awesome. Then I come across a photo of a woman being pepper sprayed.. I'm thinking to myself: hmm if I could get a cop to pepper spray me I may get rid of these sinus headache migraine things..
lol yowza
XD
that ill are we?
Yeah
Just had a turkish pizza though so the burn feels good
lol
pretty good too
My neighborhood has been transforming into some sort of chinatown :x
lol how so?
well we have 2 chinese restaurants, a mexican, 2 afro-caribbean shops, 2 turkish stores and I believe 1 greek restaurant aswell
"china town"  lol
lol
Chinese-ish Town
Guh I do NOT want to work today
slept at 1 am :<
Yeah I went to bed around 11pm, tried to sleep but the neighbors were making noise, then a headache came on :/
I can do art, want me to take over for the day?
lol it's not art
it's inventory
I receive shipments and load the store
I can probably do that too :P
At least it's not windy and wet overthere (is it?)
lol no
Winter is coming :(
cool
buh I'm just tired as hell
and i know for a fact that today is going to be double-intake
boot season is peak season
vgs
I feel ya
this is cool: https://education.github.com/pack/
lots of useful stuff + unreal engine 4
thx, puts it with the rest of my useful, may need bookmarks :P
I wonder what CrowdFlower is... costs $/month o_O
never heard of it
applied for my package
seems useful
Gutte nacht mein doctors
Guten nicht
yo tony, apparently mentos plays hearthstone on and off :P
we should have a 3-way :P
wut
lol
can you even do that
nah, but i thought it would be funny to say
we could all play eachother for funzies though
lol
DBZ Voicework
that was more awesome than i thought it would be lol
roit?
riot
well then, apparently all the HR people are working today... got an email for a test for a computer tech job at a school district and just got a phone call about a programming internship
oh snap
awesome man, which one are you gonna go for?
i have no idea
lol
have to go through interviews first anyway
so fingers crossed
could do both I suppose, depending on the hours for both and the employment situations. good luck!
Yay steam is priced in canadian dollars! Yay I dont have to pay $10 conversion fee at my bank everytime i put money in that steam wallet! Yay!
lol
yay!
very nice!
that would seriously suck. oh a game is 5 bucks, too bad I have a conversion fee :(
you'd have to do it like 100 bucks at a time for that to even be remotely worth it
neeeeddddd tacooooossssss
maintenance never came
Tacos
on Tuesday
That should be
a "thing"
it is
A joke, that was
it goes well with taco wednesday
and taco friday
and well, taco any day
I can only have tacos like once a week
you need more taco variety
I do have plenty of taco variety
Also have you guys seen "Life is Feudal" on steam?
what is the craziest taco you have ever had?
Ghost pepper fish tacos
sounds unpleasant
It was delishiously painful
imagine eating ghost peppers so your mouth is on fire and then chugging milk to cool it off and then vomiting it all back up
that's what I would do
either that or i would just suffer to avoid milk
which is far more likely
I don't need milk for them
I just deblt with the heat
lol
However my friend did just as you described. Poor Jeff.
lol
RIP Jeff
Time for a Jeff story
is he a redneck?
My friend Jeff brags about how he can take spicy food
is he worth a fox?
no
So
Everytime he brags
I challenge him
I have won every time
and he won't give up
only one?
He has vomited 3 out of 8 times
no but you one
oh
won
lol
lol long day
your ninja edits didn't save you that time
They will now
no one will know
but you
Plus I could be a grammer ninja
I do those pretty fast
i saw it
just didnt say anything because doing analysis hw
anyway
yes
tacoooos
yum
and Flashhhhh woooooo
yes. very excited for that
what time does it air?
dunno
8/7c
cool
it'll probably be up by the time we get back from tacos then
it'll probably be on TPB within 30 minutes from now
from east coast viewers
ah, true
is that pdf derp for anyone else?
it has the same page like 52 times
yep, same page a bunch of times
so
i made a miracle rogue deck, basically a deck that keeps the enemy from killiing you until you kill them in 1-2 turns (about turn 5-8 if you get good cards) and it is incredibly fun
"always going on about climate change"
lol
that was accurate enough that it makes me smile
and yes
lol'd at climate change
also hodor
and honestly, colbert would rock rock at ruling if he tried
because of etho's strange word pronunciation, i always imagine he lives in a secluded log cabin up in the mountains with no verbal 2-way communication to anyone
lol
sounds like he plays minecraft a lot :P
he likes cheese filled pastuh
eww
cheese
and pasta?
bleh
yesterday i put shreaded cheese on my chicken sticks
because i completely lack condiments
Go buy mustard?
its cheap
mustard is gross
^agreed
Mustard is good
cheese is good
Make some ranch dressing then
Cheese is bad
make? sounds like a lot of work
95% of dairy products are bad
Homemade ranch is amazing
100% of dairy is bad
Cheese is dairy
or at least lactose is bad
i never said bad = tastes bad
it's bad but tastes good
I like lactose
i do not tolerate lactose
lol
I only like about 4 different cheeses
sucks to be you
I too do not tolerate lactose
sucks also to be you
You can't eat spicy food
and have never been to Ricardos
Sucks to be you
we dont know that
yeah ^
I cant know but if its a tolerance thing I could potentially
We do know that
you dont know the glory of Mr Ricardo
lol yuh huh
Courtbille is too nub 5 spicy foods
well
not for long
Psssh
Brandon
I too will soon learn of the Ricardo's
When do you come back next?
thanksgiving
You mean
Ricardosgiving
yes
thankardos
[8:36:23 PM] Courtney Boyle: I too will soon learn of the Ricardo's
"sure" you will
Also Brandoni, my family is leaving for thanksgiving
I am not
so we should have Ricardos that weekend
i agree
I agree with your agreement
andrewwww
when tacossssss
we'll leave at 10
if you want you could come over and watch me play hearthstone or hang out or something lol
as fun as watching you play hearthstone sounds, i think i'll just stay here till then :p
well we could do something other than that i was just making the most obvious and clearly best suggestion :P
Ri
car
does
Rhode Island Car Does what?
Ian has become decobot again, he's taking things from the cia's database and putting one word from each article on here
NORAD launch passcode - 1968 : 0000000000000
that's more than one word
this is not decobot!
send in the troops!
No really
Thats the actual code
this decobot sucks
right?
lol
in 1968 that was the code?
yes
to fire zee missiles
That was actually the code until 1977
you have mentioned that before
January 14,  at 22:58:26 GMT to be precise
however, the number of 0's is inconsistent with your earlier statement
Its 13
ready brandoni?
in like 48 seconds, yes
ready
flash good: looking forward to arrow tomorrow x 10000000
i cant remember what happened in the finale
lol
hallo
so nao
I think you'd enjoy this Dancing With the STars clip
so mezo
is it the carlton?
yes
lol
but the moment it hits is just epic
War Thunder update confirmed for tomorrow
woo
so excite
and arrow tonight
my lab ta left early to go catch it live lol
lol
do we know what tree the ho229 is down deco?
so we gon arrow after i grab alex from work brandoni?
when will that be?
like 1030 probably
[8:04:41 PM] : do we know what tree the ho229 is down deco?
Me 410
yay i'm almost done that tree lol
i am tired, i'd like to get to bed early :F
So heavy fighter tree
laaaame brandon :F we need your technical prowess to watch it on the big screen :( lol
lol
i have to get up 30 minutes earlier than normal tomorrow though :(
but then you'll be super happy for like an hour before bed
because arrow
no then i'll not be tired :F
#lameneighbors
#sleepwhendead
#pleeeeaaaase?
:l
you know you want to
so arrow yes yes yes? i'm leaving to get alex now hypehypehype!
!!!11ELEVENONE1!!
it isn't on their site yet
it probably wasnt up til like 11 last night either
i think they added it at 10, but it isn't loading right
gotcha
exxactly at 10 it started showing a "unable to play" message
and then it skips to a trailer
interesting
well maybe itll be fixed by the time i get back
lol
brb
maybe
it's working now
andreeewwwww hurrryyyyyyyyy
no time
ignore the url
but dat progress
working user account creation/log in
tony: more proof that big words are dangerous to use around people
why did you link us to a website describing punk rock culture?
AP: War Thunder update is out
i saw that
very exciting
FAIRE
also, that spunk rock?
also
oh my god
I wish we could just laugh people out and/or just explain that shit
that's just the url my group member had lying around. it's the unr cse submission site
hi
hi
hgi to you too
did you see beta 3 is out for renx?
yes
i wonder if its decent
probably, but there's hardly any players still
yeah
kinda lame
when do you want to do arrow?
dunno
brb
my internet speed is too slow to load speedtest.net
wut
did you restart everything?
no
i'm hoping it will pass and just fix itself
lol
so much faster to restart
once speedtest actually loaded i got 11 down and 4 up
i should be getting like 30 down though
sounds like router/things
because its NEVER The isp's fault
this router is not even 3 months old though
i had a router for three weeks once and it completely pooped out
so apparently there are just clowns in california
like
they come out at night
there's no criminal activities tied to them
and no one knows who they are
wut
i had a router for a day and it was already dead before i plugged it in
they're just being clowns
that was the router before this one
and it's kinda horrifying in it's own regard
sounds like your circuits are odd
as in the voltage is 3, 5, 7, etc volts
idk
lol
i thought that would be funny :F
ohm my god
shocking, right?
internet speed is recovering now
i wonder if it's a coincidence that it works now and I also just paid my internet bill like 10 seconds ago
i usually reinforce my internet connection just by calling my ISP
lol
I like to believe that I create a wired connection and my internet uses that to establish better connectivity
lol
so, arrow? (i'm excite/hyped)
yeah, in like 9 minutes work for you?
awfully specific, i'll double check with alex but should be fine
lol
thats how much my etho vid has left
?
andrewww
hi
e
?
large red e
you're large and ready? ok
lool
it's kinda like little caesar
but large
omw buddy ol' pal
lol k
Andrew: At Large
Coming this fall
Check your local listings
Synopsis: 
Dectective Andrew M. Duck attempts to thwart the plots of the evil Deco, INC.
i'm guessing his tagline is "send in the troops"
hi
dont worry andrew, i gave the murderer the slip
oh good
alex thought you died since you said "oh im dead"
that was to lul the murderer into a false sense of security
then i sidestepped and did a triple sowcow on him and ran back home
Bang bang
bing bong
BingDong Li
lol
Kim Jong un
ded
not yet
did they find him?
He was never lost?
He just refused public appearences
I thought he was missing
ah
anyone want to play a game?
waht gaem
War thunder
Its updated
but i dont want to playz that right meow lol
i want to play a slow paced shooter
like what would be a good example of that?'
lol
a splinter cell campaign
that is probably the definition of slow paced lol
i want a mr misty float from DQ
not a strawberry cleam slush from sonic?
that also sounds good
wat lol
lol wtf
that was hilarious
anyone up for some bfizzle4 or starcraft 2 today?
i'm up for whatever
i may buy the artemis 6 pack thing
we need 5 people
yeahhhh
that's a lot of people
lol
does it work over internet? or LAN only?
it works over internet now I believe
you may have to use a vpn though
either that or that was how people were getting around the non-internet support until they added it
someone should build a ship bridge with stations and stuff for this game
and force feedback via hydraulics under the floor
i'm guessing they have. maybe not with the hydraulics
lol
lol
war thunder has been updating for like the last hour and a half
:F
lol
so i just played a match of hearthstone against a streamer, while they were streaming
they gave up after turn 4
lol
lol were you spying on their hand via stream?
nah, it was a pretty unknown streamer but the name sounded familiar, so i hopped on twitch and looked to see if she was streaming, and i saw her concede thanks to the stream lag
lol
mackensieze
she has like 50 viewers or something :P
wow, war thunder finally fixed the problem i had with the launcher needing to be restarted after a new update
holy wow, japan has a b17 premium that you can get. if you needed a way to get the research points for the jets... lol
and oh my god the new sounds for the guns are amazing
the ki-96 sounds like a fucking battleship
lol
the new gun sounds are awesome
i want italian guy to make me an italian soda
me too :(
it seems i was not destined to have clam chowder for lunch
needs one can of milk, check fridge, out of regular milk
grab alex's milk
entire fucking thing is frozen
-_-
lol
so now i have to have steak and potato soup :F
i need sprites for my tower defense game
help me find some free ones
lol
i can draw you sprites
draw me a turret and we'll see if you're hired
wow
yeah
so
10/10 yeah?
if you can find someone to draw the sprites for you then you're hired
my mouse is a little shakey
it kinda makes it look like i have parkinsons
but
i cant help that, it's the mouse
lol idk a guy with parkinsons probably could have drawn better turrets
using a mouse? I think not!
for real though my mouse has really bad horizontal noise
lol yeah i bet
the one on the left was drawn with myh metal mouse pad
on the right, my new mouse pad
(those are pepsi cans)
that's why i use my metal pad for BF4. Otherwise aiming is basically impossible
yeah you know the more i look at this the more i realize this is probably not supposed to be this bad: http://i.imgur.com/JQsVruY.png
yeah that's pretty bad
like
wtf mousepad
y u do dis
lol
yeah
apparently thise mouse is known to be terrible on cloth mouse pads
interesting
mine seems fine
yours probably doesnt have that problem
definitely not. just tested it lol
the only problem i have is my horrible straight lines
lol
a family in St. Louis was driven out of their home after thousands of spiders started pouring out of their walls
nope.flamethrower
they were brown recluses
between 4500 and 6000 in the house
no
just no
how
why
phew
just redid all of the wiring for monitors and stuff at my desk
nice and pretty now?
about as good as it was before. maybe slightly better
my modem and router are on the right side now though
so i don't have two separate groups of wires
gotcha
so i just tried starting my tower defense game
after about 15 minutes of work it decided to blue screen when exiting fullscreen mode
and it seems the file is corrupt
looks like i'm not working on that today
:F
i'm very sad sc:blacklist has nobody playing anymore
i'm craving that kind of gameplay
yeah
i am starving
i should go to winco
we need to hit up winco as well
shall we go together?
we could do that for sure
when do you want to go? i'd like to wait til alex gets home if possible since she's the one with the knowledge of what we need besides bread and things I want
when will she be home?
i'm not sure
she gets off work at 6
but she's going to coffee with katie or something
we could go at 6 or so if i can get ahold of her by telephono
ok in the mean time i will scour my place for food that doesn't involve a rice cooker
lol
Hi
hi
How is ya'll
hi
bueno
japanese guns are best guns to listen to now
They are
And the 20's destroy
they do indeed
they finally sound like guns rather than someone flicking a credit card
Exactly
this is strange but kinda good
chicken sticks with salad dressing
wut

I WAS LAUGHING OUT LOUD
TWICE
HA
WOW
HAHA
I KNOW RIGHT
NO
these bbq chips are weird
which ones?
the one with the rib
aha
the deep ridged ones
lol
yeah
the ridges are too deep
they looked too deep
like
who needs that much surface area hidden inside a chip?
i want ti play a game (and not do this HW)
i played a bit of hearthstone but got wrecked
it seems the weekends contain more competent players at my rank
lol
andrew, which mall does alex work at?
My Google Cardboard arrived :D
meadowood
ah. i have to go to bestbuy/micahels which are both by there, if you want to carpool there whenever
would you want to go tomorrow at 2 and take alex with you? i've got lab (not mandatory, but really helpful with the midterm on thursday) at 1
she works at 2, so it'd be like 130ish
also yay cardboards
i could
that was strange
after taking cardboard off i was seeing double of everything
that is strange
did it go away?
after like 20 seconds yeah
oh then i'm sure you're totally fine >.>
lol
so you're for sure good with taking her tomorrow?
i'd prefer to go today but if it lets you go to lab i can do it tomorrow
lol
well if you want/need to go today, i'm sure she can find someone to take her
and worst case i can just take her and be a little late to lab
then I may just go today in a little bit
I want to see if bestbuy will let me trade my mouse again
gotcha
but I don't know what new mouse I'd want
naga
Corsair M65 or Logitech G502
nagaaaaa
roccat kone xtd
not going with razer
aww
razer has issues a lot
i like their designs and stuff
but they do have issues
my current mouse is a razer and it hates my mouse pad
the corsair one I assume would work well on a corsair mouse pad
the logitech one actually lets you create a profile that adapts to whatever surface
so I could make a profile for the mouse pad and it would work perfectly
roccat has the same deal
and so far i'm super impressed with the quality of the mouse
#honestreviews
i also like logitech's software though. dunno if i'll like corsair's
the corsair mouse is an all metal build
hmmm decisions decisions
i feel like that'd be heavy
and cold
maybe
probably
lol
but good build quality is nice
i already have a logitech keyboard and if i ever wanted a wireless mouse i'd go with logitech. also all my other preipherals are logitech
speakers, webcam, etc
so i guess there's value to just using the same brand for everything
i gauss
one software to rule them all
lol
and it looks cool
yeah i saw that one
it just looks too complex
it's less complex that that RATZ one
lol
it reminds me of the cyborg i had, and i didnt like that one
yeah
lol
that's what i mean though
simple is better
i tend to agree
that's the other option
it is $10 less but honestly has far fewer features
no free spinning scroll wheel mode, no left/right scroll, fewer mappable buttons, smaller sensitivity range
of course, i never use any of those features. i might use left/right scroll and free scroll, but i get by fine without them too
that one is pretty
got the G502
my old mouse had like 1 week left of warranty lol
bought a new 2 year warranty for $15. Got the mouse for $10 + tax
and it's usually $80
good deal
very nice
also poster frames at Michael's are expensive
$50 for an 18x24 frame
wow
yeah
so i went to target and got a nearly identical frame for $15
lol i was just gonna suggest that
so, i may need to reclaim a few of those nails that are chilling in your walls
lol come get em
we dont need em
in a sec, configuring my mouse
I can draw reasonably straight lines on my cloth mouse pad now :D
cool
the only error is coming from my inability to draw straight lines
lol
this goes up to 1 DPI x_x
i think mine does too
that's so incredibly unnecessary lol
oh no, mine only goes to 8200
yeah
8000ish is the upper limit of what I can reasonably use
aint nobody need that much
i use 4000
oh, I'm at 6400
which is kinda high for me
my old mouse was probably around 4000 too
yeah, 3200 - 4000 is pretty standard for gaming mice
my mom still uses a mouse that has a ball in it
using that is unbearable
lol
yeah
whoever invented the laser mouse is my hero
ok, gonna come grab nails now
ok
doktors
dragon age origin is free right now on origin
wut is
fun rpg
mass effect-esque but medieval and spells and dragons and shit
multiplayer online?
coop i think
yeah
downloading it
good man
Space Engineers is great fun
Pretty limited atm though
Yeah
We played it for a week solid
then stopped
lol yeah
I assume once there is a big update we'll do the same again
programming update!
It runs alright with a few asteroids but once there are large structures the framerate drops pretty low. Surprising though :p
greetings
yellow
The pleasure is mine!
hi ;p
lol
lol
watch your back...
haha
I WILL BE YOUR DEATH
rogue is awesome
I made a miracle deck
haha
#OPASFUCKKKKK
so much fun to play
#OPASGANGNAMSTYLE
lol
almost
so close
lol
Been busy since wednesday, only had saturday to chill out
when do you want to do prog lang hw andrew?
that's a great question. lol I want to work on this game and study more for analysis but I don't really know how much more studying would help and this game is boring to make
so we could do it now for a change of pace
also, ment, I hit rank 11 two days ago, then dropped back to 12 after losing to hunter twice :F
my miracle deck has taken me a ways up the ladder lol
I've got to play around with a different character, made a Mage Freeze deck
we should do prog lang later tonight, i need to do some software engineering hw first
freeze mage is fun
ok, whatever works for you
secrets mage is crazy
basically, hope you don't face hunter and hope they don't run double flare
there's a version of secrets mage that runs giants in it, kind of a hybrid handlock-secretmage
it looked interesting
haven't seen that one
once i gather up the dust for it, i'm going to try making a ramp druid
turn 2 yeti? yes please
lol scary, goodness
double innervate double wild growth OP
I've got to start building better decks
Anyways i've only been playing a few games at a time
yeah, i havent had a ton of time
i made an inner fire priest deck that's a lot of fun to play
Inner Fire Priest o_O
Goes to show I have just been building my own decks :P
Just a mash and mix of cards that seem to work together
yeah, that's what I did with the priest deck
basically just double your minions health with divine spirit, then use inner fire for 20+ damage and health minions
Nice
Handy, I'll give it a worl
wurl
vvd
lol
wat
do you still have the cracked version of office brandon?
oh nvm
wat lol
unr sent me a check for $480
wut
why lol
financial aid refund for summer apparently
not sure why
I shouldnt have had any finaicial aid over summer
interesting
ikea has expensive shipping
$350 shipping for a $280 item
we're pretty far away lol
still that more than doubles the price
yeah, that's pretty lame
my parents are gonna bring a dining table up sometime soon for us, maybe you could get them to grab your couch and bring it up as well?
maybe
so i played a bit of RenX earlier today
it's a lot smoother now than it was before
there were about 120 people on, too
wow
nice
did they add any cool content?
emp nades, AT mines
2 new maps
so not much
lol
that's cool though
lots of bug fixes and a new launcher
oh nice
that launcher sucked
lol yeah
oh one of the new maps has ladders
STAY. AWAY. FROM. THE. LADDERS.
after 3 failed attempts to dismount at the top of the ladder, i went up once more and looked around confused
somehow i got launcher about 50 feet in the air
lolwat
landed and took 122 damage
impressive
yeah
i've never seen such terrible ladders in a game lol
basically impossible to get off without falling back down or being launched to low earth orbit
lol
these look pretty cool
yjrdr ;ppl [tryyu vpp;
^ is what i typed first, with my fingers over one key
lol
thought i learned russian somehow
i want one: https://i.imgur.com/cAO2ErE.jpg
tesla?
toyota
no way
wow
it's a concept car still
figured
but still
very pretty
yeah
want to do prog lang hw now?
sure
my place or yours?
i'm good with either, head on over when you're ready :P
lol
ok
mostly because alex will be home within the hour, and she doesnt have keys
hi
hi
talking with my mom, 1 sec
lol
k
so then, mumble?
suer
mumble for what?
renegade x
Is that any good?
meh
lol
it's fun in bursts
it's a great game!
What do you do in it?
so race mode still needs some work
Race mode?
war thunder
it respawned me inside a mountain like 5 times in a row after dying
if my repair costs werent like 400 credits i'd have bugged out
other than that they were fun though
challenging
Oh yeah, I don't fly races
We should squad up after midterms
i'm beat
can anyone recommend a good bluetooth dongle?
I'm sure someone could :x
Hi beat, I'm Ment
I haven't a clue, sorry
oh har
hello
ugh I suck at games
yeah, after midterms and big projects are out of the way I have a lot of games and updated games to play so i'll definitely be down
LEL
caps :/
wait midterms are gone?
no
they are happening
so tony did originate ever contact you?
nah
y they no
I really don't know if I'm skilled enough in what they want
Hi
What did you apply for Tony?
didn't apply
just met top 3 peeps + talent recruiter and gave them business cards and portfolio
one said I'd hear in a week
another said about a month or so
"A blunt for blunt thoughts, adding color to the grayscale, Rolling up got me feelin well confined in a jail cell only to see what your mind can tell, If you find yourself would you pay the bail, deep thoughts on the bottom of the wishing well, following my spirit animal like a carousel, funny how people only care when you compare" - random text message I just got
the last line didnt rhyme
uhhh
hmm
one sec
"Smoke weed to think deeply and add some pizzaz to apparent dullness. I like smoking weed. I feel like I'm only a brain, my body is limiting. Would you explore with other drugs to escape this feeling? You have to think deeply in order to find amazing things. I feel like life has me going in circles. People only like you if you're amazing." ~ My rough translation.
3deep5me
lol
a totally believable translation though
also lol
although i don't know if "Rolling up got me feelin well confined in a jail cell..." really equates to "I like smoking weed"
imagine they fail at punctuation
"A blunt for blunt thoughts, adding color to the grayscale, Rolling up"
"got me feelin well confined in a jail cell only to see what your mind can tell, If you find yourself would you pay the bail,"
2 separate thoughts for me
because why would rolling up make him feel like he's ina  jail cell with pizazz?
4deep6me
all I can see is how the last line doesnt rhyme
free verse
but the rest of it rhymes
so he's breaking the cycle
they dont' follow timing either
in 3rd verse it's already garbled
so rhyming seems irrelevant by then
was it just a random number?
maybe what he meant was, weed can make blunt thoughts seem less... blunt. and that he is a prisoner to weed, because without it the world is dull
yeah
so really he's dull
but weed makes him seem not dull
or the world is dull and weed makes it more colorful
perception is subjective so i think they're both dependent
JOHN CENA!!!! ~da dun da dun dunnn~
they're a dull person in a dull world and they feel like weed makes them more interesting and the world more interesting
now, what does the color of the curtains mean?
blue
they're just blue fucking curtains
nobody looked at that link i sent?
lol
i looked at it
it was funny... :F
saw it was a prank call
me too
exited
aww
>_>
it was actually funny
it really is hilarious
i did the same but then i gave it a 2nd chance
you have to get to the fourth call
on your recommendation and another link then yeah maybe I'll give it a 2nd chance
that's the funniest one
these usually end with "YEAH WELL I CHEATED ON HIM TOO HAHAHAH" and terribleness
no
nonono
k
not a childish prank call
a radio station prank call
so there is effort
lol they were radio station prank calls last time
wait what the first one
well this one is well done
lol
"We're never gonna have wrestling in this house *again*
what the hell happened
i know right haha
we dont talk about that
not since the accident
_ever_
"umm hi do you support the military?"
no
oh good
Also that video is amazing
hmmm i should make another grilled cheese
lol
perhaps with some soup this time
see if ian liked it then you know its funny
wait
brandon
want to go get innout or something?
i need a break
sure
ok this gets progressively funnier but I also feel kinda bad
lol
i also wonder if it's staged?
watch it all
or listen
because there's not much to watch
lol ^
so, drive through ok?
this mouse is so curvy and nice
yeah
i've gotta get gas and the cheap place is near there, so i figured we could stop by
cool
this is like Brandon levels of trolling
lol
tony, i exchanged my mouse for the 3rd time at bestbuy
oh jeeze
4 mice, only paid full price for one lol
lol good god dude they are pro
you should keep a running total of how many years that chain of mice keeps you going
i actually had warranty left this time
2 weeks left
i plan on it lasting forever
lol
i can pay $15 for a 2 year warranty, and do this every 2 years
i have a feeling my mouse will last too long for that
basically  get a new mouse for $15 + the difference. This mouse is woth $80 so yeah
the mouse doesnt need to actually die
they dont test it
yeah, but I like this mouse
just get a new one every 2 years! :D
so why would i pay money for what I already have, just slightly newer
yeah but it is fun to change things up every so often
true
in a year i might want a different mouse
that corsair looked damn sexy
lol
ksoburgersnow?
this mouse has a metal scroll wheel and it gets cold
i imagine the corsair is like ice
yeah
lol yeah thats what I thought when you said it was metal
they have a non metal version
RAAAWRRRR METAL RAAAWRRRR
should i head over now?
༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つAMENO༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ

not yet
ok
if rejection is ever confirmed, I'd at least like a reason
experience / skill / style / etc.
they have hundreds of applications at the moment
it took them a few months to get in contact with me, i think
h'okay
and then the cops arrived
lol
andrewww
taco 2'sday?
wut
[12:22:00 PM] Anthony Humphreys: h'okay
[3:23:30 PM | Removed 3:23:36 PM] Anthony Humphreys: This message has been removed.
[3:23:30 PM | Removed 3:23:34 PM] Anthony Humphreys: This message has been removed.
[3:23:53 PM] Anthony Humphreys: and then the cops arrived
lol
hmm maybe
we may be making dinner
idk how much alex has started already
cause we forgot
lol those were two messages not meant for this chatroom
so i hid them
you should decide fast because i am starving and my actions depend on knowing whether tacos or not
starvingggg
lol come over here, we made guac and we're making lemon-garlic chicken with spinach and orzo (little pasta rice thingies)
and we can study and stuff

So according to war thunder's leaderboards my combat rating is in the top 1% this month

Explains the constant uptiering
I don't have resting bitch face, I have resting adorable face.
I hate that
wut
do you know what resting bitch face is?
No I know
I just don't know of anyone who says resting adorable face
that's me
O?
i tried to look intimidating and i look wide-eyed and curious
blargh
The trick to intimidation is the nose
Its all about the sneer
i have a giant nose
maybe that's it
Point it up more-so and flair the nostrils
My feet smell like poo
I approve of this message
And I like it
A lot
Would anyone else like to take a wif?
It's quite marvelous

lies. i only said his feet smell like poo and that he approved the message
alex said the rest
NOP
YOU SAY ALL
SO SAID YOU ALL
Tony: flood the market is my dad's #1 tip
you have the qualifications, so fill your portfolio with your best work, make some new best work to keep your skills on point, and send them to anyone who is even maybe possibly accepting applications
also stop thinking things like "i might not be good enough to work there"
^
the trick is, act like you do even when you don't and eventually you might
lol ok... I just hate not knowing >:I
just play it off like you do know, then if you don't actually know figure it out asap
I:
employers would much rather have an employee with the potential to learn and know more than an employee who knows most things but fails to adapt
I mean I hate not knowing why people don't call me back
ah
yeah
that does suck
lol
follow up
ask why
even the person I was ACTIVELY WORKING WITH dropped contact -_- sent 2 emails
oh good, android lollipop has USB audio
hmm?
so you can plug it in to a usb port in a car and play audio
oh nice
that feature went away when they changed how SD cards mount
but it's coming back I guess
interesting
so i dont have to go to lab
i finished the hw
if you want to come chill you can
y no lab?
we're making homemade pizza too if you want some

but it was doable on my own
ah
no lab this week
in a little bit, i'll head over
ok
eating the rest of my u-swirl

also upon further inspection, the new Nexus devices are kinda disappointing
actuallky scratch the pizza
do you want pho?
not really a fan of pho lol
(or something from a thai/chinese place)
got a menu?
interesting
that isnt entirely accurate
they have much more than that
and delicious boba
if anything you could come with and if you dont see anything you want other than boba we can stop by somewhere for you
that 2nd image looks good
is that pho? lol
it's by all the pho
umm
i thought pho was soup
it is
that looks like a rice dish with egg rolls on the side
i'll go
they also have chow mein, chow fun, most mainstream meat/sauce stuffs
ok
coo
noodles on standby chow mein nearby egg drop soup? i'm a won ton soup guy
they actually have won ton pho
that's what alex and I get

also im down for a round if someone wants
I'm on now... fite meh!
lol
did you add me yet?
I did but I don't see you
waitiiiiiittttt
you're on eu arent you
-_-
lol
gg
Didn't think it mattered
:/
yeah, different servers require different accts
:F
arg!
whelp, guess I need to start playing on my eu account more
haha
Didn't think that was a thing
have I shown you my miracle rogue yet?
nope
i'm always fiddling with it, so it's pretty much never the same deck
lol
but that's the general idea
most of the time i'm just swapping out a card for an extra violet teacher or si-7 or something
I'm pretty happy with my Ice Mage
have i seen that one yet?
not yet lemme look it up
that's the mage that got me to rank 15 last season
basically just built it up from when I started playing
(it's pretty crap lol)
+ 2 flamestrike and a Sunwalker
lol
good deck
very nice
you don't have ice block?
it's in there I have 2 of them
that's ice barrier
o wait, so not the barrier
lol
ice block stops you from taking lethal damage
really good with freeze decks
it's becomming difficult to remove cards :P
also, if you hvae the dust or the card, alexstraaza is apparently #1 best for freeze decks
Don't have enough dust for that yet
lol, i'm down to 95 dust after crafting all the preperations and things for my miracle deck
lol insanity
decided to make it as soon as i got leroy in a pack (first legendary from a pack)
k i'm gonna make an eu account now, apparently i messed up when I thought i made one earlier and made another us account instead
ah alright
Would that mean starting from scratch?
that would suck :P
yeah, no big deal though. starting from scratch means I get to practice arena runs
lol
true
alrighty, acct created
now i have to do the damn tutorial lol
hahaha
Wut
hearthstone
aye
oh
PLAY EEET
Mentalment#
i'll add ya once i finish this tutorial :F
mine is DarkWingAP#something
alrighty
I don't like digital card games
this is the first one I've played
this is the only digital card game i've enjoyed so far
Besides Solitaire, Hearts
lol
The reason I don't like card games like this is because of the luck factor
yeah this depends mostly on luck
luck of the draw, with a bit of strategy
i guess that's a factor, but if you build a solid deck (or use a solid deck built by someone else) then it's mostly strategy
sure you need luck to draw the right cards, but so does your opponent
Yeah, and that leaves a large portion of the game to chance
meh, kind of
The AI bosses are bigtime cheaters though...
if you really get down to the numbers of it then luck plays less of a factor than you'd think
Cards are always roughly half chance, at least
I know the numbers for poker
Hopefully not more of a chance han a shuffled deck of cards
Are you allowed more than four of one type of card per deck?
than*
nope, two
I don't think so
two max
per each type?
That's significantly worse odds then poker
Unsure
two of any given card, other than legendaries, which have good effects
many of the cards can have similar effects though
yeah
the game isnt so much "i need this one card or these three cards to win" its "i need this many cards I can play on turn 2, this many cards I can play on turn 4, and that will give me a good enough chance of having a good play for each turn"
etc
Meh it's just a lil something to pass the time
Hey apm, if you don't mind, we'll match another time, going to lie down for most of the night :P
haha yeah, no problem. i'd like to get a card base going first as well, i may get murdered otherwise :P
xD
Alrighty then, night all.
g'night
cya
wat do
wwaaaaaat do
don't wanna do hearthstone
but but but
jk
umm
what games do you have sitting in your steam library that you havent played yet/
you could get the free weekend of dont starve and play that
nao said it was fun
Playing Deus Ex for now :D
weird game
heard that was good as well
Deus Ex is great
number 1 or 2?
odd gameplay
I'll get into it later
dont starve isn't particularly fun, but it would be fun with multiplayer
there's no multiplayer?
not yet
hmm
it's in beta, the multiplayer
is Minimum fixed yet?
and is Toxik not failing?
what is Toxik?
toxikk whatever
spiritual halo
they thought
oh
dunno
oh it's still early access
ok
people who make youtube videos but don't mute their skype/steam notification sounds are terrible
lol
"Q4 of 
h'okay
ramen sounds really good right now
war thunder sounds pretty good
Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing Family Edition shows up on steam when you search by "Psychological Horror" tag
I remember that
lol
psychological horror
no joke
lol
i feel like playing a new game like Tomb Raider or The Last of Us
alternatively a worthy successor to Amnesia: TDD
i have >500 subs now and >50k views on the faction base tour video
and no new videos in well over a year
Make war thunder videos with me
i'd have to be particularly good for that to be worth doing
I can train you in realistic
Easy
Then you just cut out all the slow parts
i also hardly play WT
You should play more :D
Come onnnnn
its fun when you are doing well
lots of cool new planes
play
i dunno
play
play wat
play wat pls
play
play wat
play wat pls
dunno
dunno
:P
play wat pls... getfragd
nobody caught the rammstein reference? :(
lol I don't usually get those :x
lol
I'm 7-0 on my first arena run on that eu account
nice
lol paladin OP apparently, i didnt even get a spectacular deck
Arena is even more difficult to get a good deck
yeah, but its possible to get the most unfair shit ever
like mage with 3 flamestrikes and 5 fireballs
you just win
lol
haha
You know when a druid/priest or mage starts laying down spell +1 cards. they are up to something
This one time I had this priest buff a cards health up to 18, didn't really think much of it, till he made the attackequal to the health :x
lol yeah
like that deck i have :P
that's the inner fire combo lol
yeah :/
It's a good play though
yeah, its tough to get the combo though. very specifically needs a card on the board as well as two or three specific cards
crazily enough it was a 0/4 card initially
Kept telling myself it was no threat
sounds about right. gotta make it a card they won't expect, though the taunt on that card makes it tough
I silenced it :P
o well :P
lol nice
8-0
just beat a paladin mirror match :P
bout to lose to a shaman :(
yep lost
too many flametongue totems
he had four
ah, no boardclear on the paladin I guess
not that does three damage, and I have no equality :(
ah yeah
when I win I play unexpected... I often think the opponent think "what's this guy doing?"
thinks*
just lost to the same shaman again :F
that was lame
not always, just often
still
8-3 isnt bad with this deck
lol
Have you ever played against one of those bots?
9-3 would be awesome
oh yeah
tons
Apparently there are many Shaman bots out there
I usually wreck them because burst damage confuses them
I do like 20 damage in one turn with my miracle deck
lol
that's nuts
lots of fun :P
had to shut down battle.net it was just eating up my cpu
really?
weird
whelp
lost to a hunter
lame
golden dust devil lol
wow, two epics, one golden, from that pack
Nice
brawl and bane of doom
that disenchant value for golden bane of doom lol
(not a very good card)
ah
and now i have 520 dust after one arena run with a brand new account. lol
wow
that's nuts
lol and that arena run took my paladin class from level 0 to level 10
That's pretty good for a start :p
yeah not bad
doing a druid run now
cool
doing a few quests atm
when you have two ironbark protectors, it'd be nice if they werent the bottom two cards in your deck... just lost to a priest because of that
Yeah
Just played a warlock vs druid, he played his entire hand so the rest of his game was based soley on luck of draw
sounds about right
copied his 5/10 taunt, he tries to cancel out the mistake, I pull it back into my deck and replaced :P
lol
Fallen Earth
good game?
meh game?
is that the mmo?
yeah
i want opinions
dunno if I want to dedicate HD space to it lol
HDD space is abundant and cheap
but the game was fairly buggy when I played it years ago
..hm
My brother got pretty in to it
lol i believe that
he was really high level with a group of people
I jsut want to find another open mmo game
maybe beast some quests
like
have an investedc haracter
we could play '07 scape!
lol oh dear
lol
i actually looked at my old RS accounbt yesterday
their website has updated quite a bit
I had 26m coins. i was poor
I russia we give you opinion
full dragon armor was laughable
it's changed so much
lol
good god
also at combat level 98.. I was the lowest person I saw
on a f2p server
>_<
guh
T_T
this is why i like League lol
even footing
time...blargh
I'd like to see if Toxikk pans out
was toxikk a hobby/indie project? or is an actual professional studio working on it?
reakktor studios...er
looks indie
but ...since 1991?
i wonder how many people they have
and if they'll actually get the game published in a reasonable timeframe unlike some other indie studios
such as the renx people
who took like 8 years
could mess around in some war thunder?
gotta finish this stupid assignment due at 5 today
:F
Trine + Trine 2 free weekend
i so hope sengupta's not gonna be teaching that class when i take it :F
lol
well if he doesn't make us do the whole instant messenger project then it might even out
that would be nice
oh
i forgot to tell you guys
i saw dracula untold last night
it was fucking epic
didn't even know it was out lol
"Vampires don't have reflections"
lol
awesome
so, Words as Weapons was stuck in my head yesterday to the point of headaches and the inability to hear anything else all day. Today, it was gloriously out of my head. Then, the I'm Feeling Lucky button google music played it and it reentered my head :(
so, I played Raise your Kappa and it is now stuck in my head instead :D
hahahaha
awesome
I've been listening to Cold October Wind
that song has been on repeat in my head for 48 hours
it's epic
eww. right clicking a selected string in skype offers "Search with Bing"
who performs Cold October Wind?
your mom
oh okay
WELL MET
she's pretty impressive. Making wind, not to mention cold wind, in october, is not easy
WELL MET!
i can make warm wind any month
me too
that's why its so impressive
with my ass
er
lol
oh god
wait
It's by Whiskey Bards
and of course the live version is better
and of course I want to cver it
also
why do you guys keep saying well met
did I tell you that story?
the well met story?
wat
no
lol
oh
lol uh
its from hearthstone
XD OH
umm
one of the emotes for the paladin
i dont even play the game
brandon got it from "raise your kappa - forsen edition"
i just know it from the song
Big Bear faire, not this vegas one, but the one before that some pirate captain was going aroudn introducign teh guild
but not like a human but like a pleb
WELL MET! he said boisterously
with no sense of irony
Wilds got a kick out of it
so next time they saw him they made fun of him by going up to him and heartily saying WELL MET with a handshake
pirate bro was very excited to be greeted so personably
WELL MET
lol
WELL MET
YOU HAVE BESTED ME
you have bested me..
FORSEN IS LOVE. FORSEN IS LIVE. FORSEN HAIR IS VERY NICE.
I WANT TO SUCK YOU
SWEDISH MEATBALLS
way to misquote
shhh
Awesomenauts also free this weekend
"FORSEN IS LOVE, FORSEN IS LIFE, FORSEN'S HAIR IS VERY NICE. FORSEN IS SEXY, AND HE ROCK. I JUST WANT TO SUCK HIS..."
"SWEDISH MEATBALLS"
i was close enough
ehhhh
not really
i dont even know the guy
i want pizza
or dennys
but it has to be shitty overcooked pizza
the bottom of it has to be too stiff
and thin crust
why
lol
i dunno. that's my craving
sounds like you need overcooked little caesars
ask them for a slightly undercooked pizza? Customer is always right :P
you can ask for well done pizza actually
WELL MET
My Greetings
I MUST PROTECT THE WILD
The light shall burn you!
I:
WHAT
lol
I WILL BE YOUR DEATH
I THOUGHT I WAS ALMOST DONE
THERE ARE TWO MORE PARTS TO THIS
lol
FML
that sucks
i'm sorry
flips table
dear god
what in the world have they done
that's like gaming cancer right there
minecraft, generic fps, dragons, zombies
they have their bases covered
that just looked horrible
I need to create something
i feel weird being inactive
make a holloween costme
draw me a bunch of random sprites and backgrounds :L
Gomez Addams
2/3 done with this networking hw
seriously who makes homework due at 5pm on a friday
blargh
FFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
I JUST FINISHED. HE JUST EXTENDED THE DUE DATE
i did a really half-assed job on the last 2/3 of it too, because I only had a few hours and it was super annoying work
oh well
lol
that's really lame that he keeps doing that
I:
that's some nasty looking bread
its like goat simulator with bread
yes
brandog/guys want to do some cs:source? could be fun
sure. also up for some gmod
i can never remember if i have that
oh i do, just not dl'd
doing that now
i think i have a giftable bundle of cs:source and gmod if anyone wants it
i don't know if i have cs source
yep, i actually have two bundles lol
yeah i don't have that
i do have gmod though
gmod reuses a lot of cs:source textures and models
kinda need both
I can gift you it
I've noticed @_@
I'm down but I won't be able to play long
i sent you it
with a bonus haiku
aww wait
lol saw that
but apparently...
guest pass: This pass only gives you access to the full version of this game for a limited time period.
?
it's the full game
wait
what
um
OH
something something things.
Meow woof kappa kappa miracle
coma patient learns to woof
I have a guest pass
for osmething else
well no
same game
but i got a guest pass
these chicken sticks no longer seem like food
I felt that way about my pizza rolls after the 15th+ one
i think I have to be REALLY hungry to eat these
lol
nutrients in tube form
you need A1
yeah, i ate a bunch and they were find
after that, it was.... just... mush in a breaded tube
I had BBQ sauce
bbq only lasts so long cause its sweet
spice and salt never get old as a side dish
i have sour cream and onion chips
so, how bout that The Evil Within?
what about that evil within?
looks like it could maybe be fun
multiplayer?
i think it may be too focused on jump scares and not enough on psychological scares though
done downloading
lol
it's a horror game
saw that
SP
oh
1p roit roit
apparently it was just ported from peasantry to the master race
and capped at 30 fps
so it is max 30fps?
on pc?
yeah
RIOT
also a lot of bad reviews
welp
lol
the search continues for another good horror game
care to rescind your original statement?
so then
i have gmod and CS:S installed
me too
so then
mumble?
sure

imagine if the broth was literally nothing but squeezed out ghost peppers
cooking that would probably burn your eyes
ouch
my mom cut a lot of the spices out of it to try and tempt my dad (who cannot handle spicy food whatsoever) into eating some
he smelled it and noped
I will make some ghost pepper sauce for you guys
meanwhile my mom and sister were eating it like "push throug the pain, it's so good!"
and im like "pass the tapatio!"

hi
i just remembered I have a networking midterm tomorrow :(
what do
am bored
dunno
i am studying :l
so yeah we should definitely do Missile Wars: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uwv_7fPLpk
ok shit uhhhh
I'm about to reinforce my wordcloud issues
it's about mah website :I
images are cached
i want to know how to NOT do that
for you specifically for testing purposes or for everyone who visits your site?
erryone
i just renamed teh file
making sure the vnucleus logo actually went to the business card mockup instead of just a larger version of the logo
nao
for u
lol
caching is good and you should cache
X_X
well it's fixed anyways
if you change an image just upload it with a different name and point to it instead
lol i did
alien isolation looks like a fun game to play amnesia style
it does
i will probably buy it and then we should play it some weekend
sounds good to me
ohai
ohai
so tony, remember shannon from the holoween party a few years ago?
her mom was farmville
she WAS farmville. like. all of it.
yes
i do remember her
lol was that her costume or was she one of those crazy farmville moms
my mom keeps pushing me to message her on FB and apparently her sister keeps pushing her to talk to me
lol
she was the farmfville pig
._.
ummm
andrew: both
brando: why
lol
i dunno
lol does she have any interest whatsoever?
here we can pull a doctors play on this
as in
i only know what I have heard from 3rd hard info
well here
as in her sister told her friend told my mom
@_@
uh
are you interested in rekindling?
well here's the thing
sounds like sister thinks she needs a bf
lol
yes
so
she isn't my usual type (physically), but she's nice/smart
so there's that
but I can't really say if I'm interested without knowing her better
pics/fbs?
we were good friends like WAY back
like 1st grade era
Andrew: she's cute
redhead freckles and petite with a nice smile
ok so what you do
to get your mothers off both your backs:
hang out platonically
like don't expect a damn thing
in fact if you want to kick it up a notch
well theres 800 miles in the way
try to find each other mates
like "date that dude he's a bro"
and she can be your wingman
in which case
we're both shy though
so
suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck ok
so
i dunno
lol
lol
both shy is a bad combo
because then it's like the xkcd comic
both indecisive
i'd just (unless you actually are) let mom/sister know you're not really interested in a relationship at the moment or some other bullshit that you come up with
but that's just me
cause that's what i did back in the day
lol
well I'd be down for trying it out, but I'd kinda have to be in Vegas for that, I feel
well just let her know you'll let her know next time you're in vegas and see how it works out then. no harm in hanging out
Just be like "seriously... Reno. I'm down to hang out but there's no way there's gonna be a long relationship out of this"
showing that you're not interested in dating her may get her to get more comfy anyways
i figure i'll just wait till winter break in a few months
also you're not gonna be in reno much longer. like, another year or so tops, right?
yeah
anyone want to do hidden or prop hunt with hippos & co?
errrr I'm down
preference?
prop lol
i say prop hunt
always props with me
wait did her sis just get married?
is that why the parents are all "love is in the air!"
yes, but they have been pushing this for months
tell them you're like tesla at teh moment
too busy doing science to do bitches
or at the least that you don't want an arranged marriage
Brandon just be an evil sociopathic paranoid maniac and no one will ever question your motives
#justianthings
so brandon
hi
i was trying to start watching etho's terrafirma craft series
but he has no playlist for it
so i r no watch
too layz
#justandrewproblems
lol
lol
ughhh time to study HCI :(
amaranthe's new album :D
which doesn't come out till tomorrow
I really like the cover
yeah
not the music really though
it's a nice cover
Its like a harder version of soundgarden
I'm not a really hard music person
it's a mix between melodic metal and pop
The tone and harmony are good
But I can't do the hard guitar and screaming
lol
track 2 and 4 are good, I know
I'm more in the psychidelic end of the rock poll
lol
good god Courtney alive from teh dead
id rather yours right now though
teh deads
the deads?
Worship me for I am reborn!
PRAISE ALLAH
Digital World is awesome
wait
Its a vampire! Get the stakes!
ALLAH HUA ACKBAR
Allan's snackbar
I LOVE SNACKBAR
Does no one else like psychidelic rock?
i do
I'm just in a melodic/symphonic metal mood lately
Woo Tony
it's much easier to rock out to
I can appreciate it, as it technically complex and well made, its just not up my alley
Tony have you heard of Temples?
nope
Do you like revolver era beatles/pet sounds beach boys?
With a modern twist?
no idea
just click the link
haha
dig it
hiccups are terrible
Its one you can listen to start to finish, it all blends so well
hold your breath
holding my breath usually doesn't work
trying it, though
Don't hold the breath in
let all the air out
then do not breath in
and relax the dyaphram
i think it worked
lol
lol
drop dead cynical is a song on their new album brandon?
yeah
first single from it they released
Digital World was good, so was Over and Done
and of course Drop Dead Cynical, Trinity, and Massive Addictive were also good
danger zone has too much of the screamy guy
gotcha
tracks 2-8 are very good
yeah
9-11 were alright, nothing amazing
the acoustic ones are nice
irellevant
odne
wat
hm
irellevant
yeah
i should make some soba noodles
apparently my HCI test isn't today o_O
now I am wondering what WAS due/happening today
If it wasn't that test...
dun dun dun
lol
brandon, taco tuesday later tonight?
yes
coool
at like 10ish yes?
yep
i scored 96
the worst you can get is 100 i believe
I thought I did really well before I submitted it
I did that yesterday
I got a 4
show off :p
The red/purple one is the only area I made a mistake on
I basically solve it by grouping them in to two groups
and then beyond two broad groups, I can't distinguish any further
I can make a little more progress if I view my screen at weird angles
I did something similar except I zoomed in
redoing it with cheaty super monitor angle viewing and zooming in improved my score to 69
wow editing it with photoshop makes me realize that I am bad at colors
ready brandoon?
yessir
oquay
head on over whenever you're ready. we dont have to leave for like another 7-10 minutes
okie
so my newer router just got blown out
my old ass modem is still kicking
why best buy
and of course in my infinite wisdom teh receipt is nowhere to be found
o hey
hiya
oh also happy birthday m31
^^
wait
what
um
ok
I just said hi :P
so life is a series of turning it on and off again
no my router just works now
It could be dying regardless. Had a modem like that for a while.
my modem still works....but my router
my router is *new*
ish
like 2 months
and i have no receipt for it :<
How'd you pay for it? Cash?
no need for a receipt
sometimes perfectly good routers do just need restarted though
or a factory reset
had to reset mine 2x before it would work properly
it was card
yeah i'm hoping it was just  a restart
they have records of all sales
^
my parents router needs restarted every few months, and if there is a power outage it can take hours to get it working properly again
Got the latest firmware?
yeah
i think every building on campus should have nap pods
this isn't japan/google
unfortunately
i could totally nap for the next 3 hours
I:
happy b-day m31 :D
we had HW4 handed back today, andrew
I didn't see yours though
there was one without a name that may have been yours
i thought mine had a name
oh well, i'll grab it later
did he pass the tests back last class?
dunno
ah
how'd you do on hw 4?
95 + 10
cool
watch me get 100+10
lol
the -5 was from those ones where we had to make one kind of loop using another
the last one needed an if statement that we didn't include
the for loop one?
yeah
i thought about that
when i looked at the homework initially I saw that one and thought, oh yeah. for loop plus if. then when we did it I didnt see the need for the if
lol
well, it seems like s1 should happen regardless
yeah but not in all cases
only if i < testcase
in all cases even, I would think
s1 is basically where i is initialized
what's it look like again?
for (s1;c;s2) s;
what's the if we're missing then?
we need an if around s1
if c s1; do s; s2; while c
but my reasoning was that c usually depends upon s1
but this is a logically controlled for I guess
so, c doesn't depend on s1
yeah I guess
and it needs to be in an if to preserve proper scope
if it is actually iteratively controlled like most for loops then our answer should work as well
kind of
our scope would still be messed up
we had:
s1;
do{
s;
s2;
}
while c;
er
yes
so in what case would ours not work?
oh
nvm
i see it
yeah, i guess that's true but losing all 5 points is pretty lame
lol
we still got 105%
well
you did
lol
most people didnt do the extra credit from what I saw
what was it again?
(Extra Credit - 10 pts) Show (in low-level ps
eudo-code, as illustrated in the textbook) what
would be the target code generated for the
tail-recursive
function from problem 5.
lol
we bs'd the crap out of that from one of his slides
lol
surprising that nobody did it
i'm sure a lot did, but of the papers that were left on the table when I went up, a lot didn't
test runs minecraft at 640x360 with intel graphics
he needs a proper computer
andrew
yes
do you have green onion by any chance?
I do not
darn
making those soba noodles?
yes
you can have some if you want
i just ate a sandwich, thanks though :P

porque?
alex is in vegas for the weekend and i'm going to california
icee
yerperooni
YupeRicardos
we should watch arrow some other time
because i am tired
sounds good to me
I'll get the car http://i.imgur.com/srO11QN.gif
lol jeeze
you gotta wonder what was going through their minds during all that
"i don't wanna park here anymore"
"my car lifts up when i reverse. What if I floored it?"
indeed they must have both been drunk
"need to get out of the car, better go through the window"
They could have handled that situation better xD
ol
lol
lo
olo
lol
Howdy ya'll
Heyo
How's the Netherlands this time of year?
Cloudy, damp, and cold :(
Come to the desert! Dry air, a nice 24 c, and absolutely no clouds!
I'll bring a telescope
Those don't work within 150 miles of Vegas
We have 0 light pollution laws
and thus we are the brightest city on earth
Our light is visable for over 300 miles :D
Hrm, Guess I'll have to make a detour to the Hooverdam first :P
Hoover Dam is worth the trip
Indeed, must be a sight to see
It is
It is the most impressive slab of concrete I have ever seen
also the largest
Light pollution is also an issue here.
I don't know if I am in the camp that thinks that light pollution is a thing
Honestly I love how light it is here at night
I'd like to see the stars once and a while though
I've seen them once or twice
They are white
and blink-y
I have aswell, just north of where I live in the middle of nowhere. Quite the sight.
How are things overthere?
Well, you have to go 300 miles into the desert to get a good view of the stars
But if you have never been to the desert I would assume the sight is quite impressive
I've never been to any desert
O:
Well the Mojave is the most desert desert on earth
I've been to the western parts of europe, miami, venezuela and the caribbean.
Those are all very nice climates
They can be at the right times
All of them are wet though
I bet they don't have barrel cacti though
Mostly imported but none in the wild
People import those?!?!?!
Those things are basically spiney weeds
You'd be surprised what they import on the island
They are everywhere
They are possibly quite expensive
Want one?
I'll drive 10 minutes from here and pick one out of the ground
xD
I think each place has it's perks
That's true
Personally
I prefer mild tropical climates
(Hawaii)
But the desert is not so bad
wait nao were you stalking my fucking imgur account?!
Wait are we stalking Mez again?
This sounds fun
lol I wanna stalk!
no
give me 10 minutes
Shipping is expenisve
We do have cacti on the island. I even have one in my apartment
Yes it is
xD
Look its Tony in 
He's even got a linkedin
I should use my imgur more
Guys
Tony's whois is good
He actually has all the required info
lol I feel bad now :P
why
Oh wait
Tony
Your website
The whois info for the registrant's phone is wrong
You entered the area code twice
I should get going, pretty late
Cya!
adieu!
cya ment

stop doing that
god i was chunky lol
I did stop
lol
But really your phone contact is wrong in your whois information
actually
for kicks
cyberstalk my dad
same name but SR.
I think he's currently a truck driver with the Teamsters
I *think*
Okay
lets do it
should I start with the state penitentiary?
you can
He's not in there
lol
county?
At least in Nevada
he's still in Nevada, I know that much
County could be a possiblity
he's not IN jail but he has records
oh boy does he have records
pepole think his records are my records sometimes
Problem is that country records are only available for active criminals unless you want to go thru the assessor's office
which I am now
Nope I would have to file a legal request
so that's out
Tony
What is your mothers first name?
Myrna
Hmm
Well
All I have found is that your dad seems to be a member of Teamsters 631
how the hell does he do that
wat
Also I may have a house sale in 
i thought he'd leave a bigger trace
Does his middle name start with D?
yeah
same as mine
Anthony Dietrick Humphreys Sr.
Is he associated with someone named Crystal?
They house's sale has two names on it
1625 HOOVER ST
NORTH LAS VEGAS, Nevada
89030
I have two other addresses
5821 Edrene Ave Las Vegas, NV 89108-
and an apartment on flamingo road
9100 W Flamingo Rd Unit 1058 Las Vegas, NV 89147-6400
stalking more people on the intranets I see
Tony asked about his dad
so I did what I could
lol
lol his ex wife
i like crystal
she's in florida and her daughter's in...what, kyoto now?
we should all do some war thunder arcade tanks
the new additions seem fun
and I havent tried yet
boo tanks
airplanes masterrace
lol
tanks get airplanes as rewards for kills though
brb
They also raised the BR for the Nazi tanks again
which is really irritating
and the reward has been reduced
by the way
since you sent me taht image
check it
7 months ago
I'm top comment :<
it never took off
Its pronounced "gee-peg"
pfft all you anarchists need to get it right, tis obviously the first and last part minus the e for giraffe
lol tony
you got top comment on the wrong repost, clearly
im bored
I'm Ian
Hi bored
I just had dinner
Y u no give me dinner
me3
dinner is nice
y u no
we should all do sumthin
i need food
i should eat
you should
actually
if you want some mushroom pasta we have some leftover
Ricardos
and alex and I are going to be gone so it needs to be eaten
lol
hmmmm maybe
idk what/if i have anything here
you have lots of delicious jams and jellies
mmm nope
i basically only have old lunch meat, cheese, and bread
yum
and asian food
asian food is amazing
but asian food requires cooking rice
i'll probably just eat a sandwich
cuz that lunch meat will go bad really soon
I want to play terraria
or anything
yeah
anything
especially splinter cell with people playing
lol
wow, easiest boss fight ever in PoE, diamond shrine = 100% crit chance, crit = freeze, infinifreeze = death to boss
lol
so ap, you seen the new lightning spell?
yep, pretty cool
i named my new char for it darth sidious
lol
because hell yeah
nice
Andrew acquire N1K2 in war thunder
too much grind
Grind actually much reduced
They condensed all the A6M varients
into folders
"too much grind" is basically the subtitle for WT
No
lol
Its easy
unless you pay for premium, it is
3+ kills per match + Realistic Battle
But I do have premium
so x2 to that
3+ kills in realistic requires grind to get that good
grind + grind = 2grind5me
math checks out
Just be pro
to start out
Or be like me and spend a ton of time in custom battles
ton of time = grind
Its not grind
just kill
Just have fun with it m8
Also is still better than World of Tanks
that's like saying the flu is better than cancer
literally anything is better than WoT
^
But but, guys
I got a fever
and the only cure is
EBOLA
moar airplanes
Tanks just frustrate me to death
in every game
I can't do it
War Thunder, WoT, ARMA... etc....
Tanks man
you're welcome
boo
mez is the local reno news facebook keeper apparently
"Owners of a local bakery received a cease and desist letter which they considered half-baked, and donut want to go down quietly. They decided to rise to the occasion, serving up a twitter apology jelly-filled with oven fresh comebacks.
I don't want to sugar coat anything, but the ‪#‎notacronut‬ campaign may be my favorite of the year."
lol good god
Heroes and Generals looks like it might be fun
is that the one frankie posted a bit ago?
yeah
free on steam
I was gonna say that after i watched the video, but it seems really slow paced
like
WWII was slow paced
lol
frankie probably edited out like 30 minutes of just running to places
yeah
but WWII isnt typically depicted accurately in video games
so it could NOT be slow paced :P
it did look fun though
we could try it out sometime
i'm about to head to california however
so
:F
Mr Docosun has played it, perhaps he can say whether it is good or not
sid mier's beyond earth is out
aint nobody got 50 bucks fo dat
yeah but it is $50
lol
it's basically sci-fi civ 5
yep
but sci-fi
looks cool but i'll get it for $5 in a year or three
^
yeah
when we feel the need to play a modern strategy game which may or may not take days to finish one game
Tony have you watched any of the avatar series stuff like legend of Korra?
apparently they made a game for it
so, i bought alien isolation last night
orly
sweet
yesrly
lol
so next weekend = frightful weekend for realz
yay
lol
I'm gonna try it out later today with headphones/darkness
don't die
i plan on probably dying a lot
but i'll try
oh also alex and I kept watching american psycho for a bit and it actually got pretty fucking creepy
like
i figured it would
bodies everywhere run hooker chick run kind of creepy
yeah
indeed
i need to go to the store :(
that means I have to get out of pajamas
yeah I probably should get packing and shower and stuff but all i want to do is play PoE or hearthstone and just chill for another day
I also want pizza
and a nice, dark red wine
from a box?
but I can't have/do any of those things :(
eww no
I don't want to get drunk
IT WAS GOOD UNTIL IT STARTED TO TASTE LIKE PISS
if i got a box i'd have to finish it in like a day
and i'd probably die or something if i did that
nah you'd be fine
I can drink two bottles of wine in 4 hours without dying, so you're probably right
but
eww
my kind of wine = good wine
boxed wine != good wine
it can be
thus, boxed wine != my kind of wine
boxed wine is usually just wine from a winery that went bankrupt or whatever and they had to get rid of their stock
right
but it's in a box
shields it from harmful UV radiation!
ever heard of aging wine? #somuchuv
(I don't really know that but it sounded good at first)
isnt wine aged in a dark cellar?
pshh
no
pretty sure it is
in dark bottles that reduce UV radiation
what kind of winery are you going to? the crackpottery barn?
no, that's where I get my crack-cocaine
oh
I go to Amy's Wine House for my wine
i thought they sold crack/pot
lool
and they sell it out of a barn so they can dress up as cows/pigs and the cops can't find them
i dont buy pot, that's bad for you
just cocaine
they disguise all of their products as feed for the animals
cocaine is just fine for you, obviously
do the pot-belly pigs sell the pot?
hitler took it medicinally
because if so that's kinda obvious dont you think?
through eyedrops and shit
lol
kind of obvious, if they did it that way
the cows sell the pot, and the pigs sell the coke inside eggs that look like normal chicken eggs
the pot comes in haybale looking things
if you know so much about this place why did you assume I got my wine from there?
they dont even sell any!
they do though
in the basement of the barn
the deep dark cellar with no uv radiation
that's why I thought you might get it from there
but if the cops bust them, they will be fored to get rid of their wine for cheap in boxes
that's why they dress up as animals
what if the cop is a wolf in sheep's clothing?
hell, what if the cop is a wolf in cop's clothing?
well then he'd try to eat them rather than bust them
so as long as they keep him well fed off the real animals they should be fine
sounds difficult
nah, you just baaaahck up and let him get the sheep before he gets to the sheeple and he'll go away quietly
that's gotta be expensive though
replacing all those animals
well they breed them
surely it'd be easier to just kill it
also he's one of those drug sniffing police wolves
their cocaine is laced with the blood of the animals, so it just kind of adds some value to their product when they get wolfed down, so it evens out in the end
he can't tell the drugs are there cause its laced with animal blood, so he gets distracted and steals a sheep and runs
wolf instincts, right?
#1 off topic conversation ever
lol
sounds like quite an operation at the crackpottery barn
indeed it is
they'd impress me if they didnt keep their wine in a deep dark cellar away from all that wonderful UV radiation
right?
i, for one, welcome the piss-flavored broken down wine!
see, this is what happens when you dont drink UV radiated wine:
dafuq
it shrivels you up
and gives you a tan
that doesn't even make sense
you're a phoney
HEY EVERYBODY HE'S A PHONEY!!!
wow
i really wasted 20 minutes talking about the crackpottery barn
impressive
gg
actually it was only 11
but close enough
11, 20, close enough
only off by almost 100%
50%?
yes
whelp, off to eat, get gas, and head to california
adios for the weekend
[11:47:19 AM] Brandon Worl: Heroes and Generals looks like it might be fun
Its not
I tried it about a month ago
its beyond grindy
and the bullets move at the speed of an old man on the freeway
lol
seriously
there was an old woman driving in front of me today
You aim at someone whos just walking, and your bullet winds up a mile behind them
she was tapping her brakes like 20x per second
xD
I swear
They must have used nerf darts to calculate their trajectories
lol
Frankie was sniping like 300 yards in his video
Also you hit a man with a 7.7 and he doesn't die
He keeps going
with a springfield i think? i dunno. it had a huge scope
It doesn't come with a scope
tell you that
lol
You have to get to like lvl 20
Firing potato pellets at people
my brother burned his eyebrow off with a potato gun
You'll lose hair playing heros and gernerals as well
Beyond Earth is now available at super high price
yup
Civ 5 space edition isn't worth $50 to me
Its worth about $20 to me
I'll get it next summer sale or something. lol
but
civ v in space
.....want
also, if you want a space-based strategy game that might take a day or ten to finish, try out sins of a solar empire :)
Hmm
that looks cool
What is the gameplay like?
very startcrafty
but slow paced starcraft
extremely enjoyable
hmmm
Alien Isolation is fun
I have no clue how far in to it I am, but I haven't died yet
and I've only nearly peed my pants twice
MFW I accidentally install 32 bit linux instead of 64 bit, and only notice after I have set up rvm, rails, git, and mysql http://i.imgur.com/LOHZLLQ.jpg?1
looks like 32 bit it is
wow
lol
i saw the iso sitting on my other VM, which is a 64 bit VM
so I just used it
ah
this post makes me uncomfortable
it's like there are clones of my grandma out there, turning off random people's stuff
I had a really weird dream last night
It started with me in a resturaunt watching a large boat dismount from the drydock. It slid off into the ocean fine. Next, I was suddenly on the boat. We were sailing out to sea, but we were sailing sideways. That didn't seem strange or significant at the time, however. We approached another boat. As we got closer, I decided I should probably get back inside the boat (I was just kinda sitting on the edge of a railway bordering the boat.)
We kept getting closer, until we collided with the boat. We kind of just bounced off of it, but then out of nowhere a GIANT iceberg comes in and hits us on the other side, thus driving us in to the other boat again. We started to sink and I got tossed around. Next time I knew, I was under water unable to see anything. I blew out some bubbles and tried to feel which way they floated, and swam that direction.
I emerged in a room inside the boat, which I assume was just an airpocket and the boat was submerged. I noticed that there was ice and magma nearby, so I reasoned I could melt the ice for drinking water. I have no clue why there was magma. Next, I tried to call for help with my phone, and apparently I called the military and was able to see the person on the other end of the phone. He said that the nearest rescue ship was 9 days away. So, I decided that I should try to find food so I can survive the 9 days.
Suddenly, I am back on the boat, on the surface of the water before the crash. With me is Andrew and some other guy. Again, we approach the other boat and the iceberg is coming at us from the other side. I remember from the first time that we're going to get tossed around and end up blind under water and tell my companions to exhale some air and swim in the direction the bubbles flow.
We crash again and eventually all emerge in a room forming an air pocket in the boat. This time, there is no ice or magma. We need to find water, and notice that there's like 7 toilets in this room (which is a bedroom, not a bathroom). So, at least we have somewhat clean water, I guess. But then, thankfully, I notice a 20l container of filtered water. Now, we need to find food. We go out in to the hallway and find several food items. The only one I remember was a box of rice krispies. Except, these weren't regular rice kirspies. They were red beans and rice krispies. Like, the red beans and rice from Popeyes'. Which sounds disgusting, but they were actually pretty good... in the dream at least.
So, now that we had food and water, the next step was to contact someone to get help. I tried to call with my phone, but it had no signal. No problem ,let me just use my tablet, which has a wifi connection (wat?). Also, at this point my phone is dying. Neither my phone or tablet are able to get a message out (perhaps the wifi at the bottom of the ocean isn't very good.) I decide to leave them on and hope it keeps trying to send the message.
After that, we head back in to the hallway to look for more supplies (specifically a phone charger. I had a feeling a phone charger wouldn't work, but I couldn't put my finger on why. Looking back, the boat was probably pretty water damaged and without power. Seems obvious now that I'm awake.)
While looking around, a door opens and some freaky looking, semi transparent dude walks out. He has crazy hair, kinda like Doc Brown from Back to the Future. I ask him who he is, but Andrew replies that he is Death. I'm like "uh, no." He was kinda ghostly though. I was able to walk right through him. So he probably was, but I decided to reject that notion.
From down the hall, we see a bunch of people running by. They ignored us though. This was definitely influenced by my playing Alien Isolation earlier the day before, when a ton of survivors just ran past me without so much as a "how do you do?" and locked the door behind them. Anyways, these people are somehow a threat to us, I realize. As they stampede past like a herd of wile animals, I capture one and bring her back to the room we've claimed. 
When I get back there, I see my phone and tablet are missing. Andrew informs me that Death stole them. This angers me, but whatever, I still have my laptop. The ocean floor wifi is still terrible, but at least Google Play Music still works.
This person we captured is going crazy, thinking we are dangerous. Apparently Death told her and all of her people that we (Me, Andrew, and other guy) are dangerous. I offer a red beans and rice krispie treat to her, as a peace offering. It works! Who can resist a red beans and rice krispy? But now the rest of her people have discovered what we have done and are at our door, pounding it down. I look at the bucket of red beans and rice krispies. There's only about four left. Oh well, it will have to do. The door should bottleneck their approach so I should be able to offer them to our invaders before they try to kill us.
This is when I woke up.
long dream
So
Do you know what the lesson here is?
Computer science and sleep don't mix
o_O
Amazing dream
lol
that dream was totally caused by playing Alien Isolation
except it was boat themed instead of space ship/station
Have you ever been on boat?
yeah
was it a row boat?
it was a cruise ship
ah
which is more of a ship than a boat i guess
Its an extra big dighy
i've also been on a ferry and canoe
I want
it would be fun to have one of those
Did you read the article on it earlier today?
i skimmed it
Its $ though
Kinda pricy
If it was $500 I'd go buy one right now
$800
Not in production yet
And you need your own bike
true
still a bike + that will be less than 2k
This is true
that's a bargin, here they go for that in euro's
They have one of those ford bike dealerships here in Vegas
well
Henderson
They make an offroad one too
That looks super cool
those wheels just look funny to me
they're so massive
They are for rocky/mountain terrain
Would be great for a bike camping trip
Bring collapsable solar panels
They sell those at Fry's now
do they generate enough power to actually charge an electric bike?
yeah
They've been quite the rage here with the 50+ folk :P
lol
Still
Off road bike
Could easily mount camping stuff
and you can always peddle
in the pedego shop page, what do the numbers in parentheses after the bike name mean?
How many are in stock I would guess
The classic interceptor is cool looking
It looks like it would be a good urban bike
yeah
$ though
+tax
thats like 70 tanks of gas for it to pay for itself
not factoring in electricity costs
So
around 1.5 years of gas
well, in Reno I fill my tank up like once per semester
lol
I fill my tank weekly
I am a commuter
I filled mine weekly over summer
Also you'd have to hire a security guard just for the bike
actually maybe it was bi-weekly
lol
Yeah these bikes look fancy
and if it looks fancy
It will get stolen
well if you work some place cool, they'd let you keep the bike inside near where you work
I don't work in a cool place :(
My boss hates inovation
No seriously
We still have 1 typewritter
my place works in the innevation center
we like inovation
give me job
lol
No prices though but expect 2k and up
2k is 2 much
indeed it is
the average bicycle here is 200-400
I need to invent a cheap easy to produce electic bicyle and rake in the money
print a bikeframe made of carbon fibre?
Not a bad idea, would make shipping cheaper
It's late I dunno what I'm talking about
Then people would just download the bicycle
and not pay for it
you wouldn't download a car
Apparently you can but we don't have the drives to download the plans for it
hola doctores
howdy
how's it goin?
alright, you yourself?
yeah, i think i'm myself. havent checked lately though
lol
lol
i'm good. just got back from california
how was it?
still there?
lol still here. it was a lot of fun, just went down to hang out with mah family since I only get to go home like once every few months
Ah cool that's nice
yeah it was good
got a new cast iron skillet from my grandma randomly too which is awesome
love cooking with those, and i didnt have one here previously
Cast iron is nice, got a little stewpot as a gift a while back
Alrighty night,
goodnight
Hey docs
hi
Hi
the last part of Alien Isolation is crazy hard
ragequit.exe
stalin.exe
brandone
want to come over and have tacos?
hi
i just made soup
i am making le tacos del puerco pulledo
i also got a sore throat from out of nowhere last night :(
hono :O
no bueno
go to bed
lol
si senor no bueno
but im not tired
but you're sicker than a rad beat dropped by the greatest of the great sir vanny ice
i'm really not very sick though
lol
i know
lol
but that analogy was cool
or is that a simile
who cares
lol
that was a simile
metaphore uses "like" or "as" iirc
anyway
really?
hmm
whatever lol
:F:F:F:F
tacooooos
actually
i'm going to make tacos tomorrow night when alex gets home
ill just make myself some mushroom pasta and a quesadilla for now
lol
I'm almost done with Alien Isolation
can't get past this part though
also I made it quite a while without dying, but after that first death the count rose quickly
also I was wrong, simile uses "like" or "as"
metaphore does not
there's quite a bit of noise coming from the apartment above me
GET IT ONNNNNN
awks
also yay i was right
lol
about me dying?
no the simile
we gonna carlake tomorrow?
yes
and i'm actually gonna get up and go lol
lol
For example, when a participant of the study was told that he had a one-in-thirteen-million chance of contracting the virus, his response was, “Whoa. Thirteen million is a really big number. That is totally scary.”
facepalm
hello doctors
bonjour!
Herro
hi
wassup
nao that was best vid ever
lol
Man I hate Mondays
everyone does
Lets ban Monday
ok
ban(Days.monday)
If only it was that easy
tuesday would be the new monday
Lets ban Tuesday
wednesday
weekends only
New plan
Lets ban work
all work and no play makes jack a dull boy, after all
Clearly
So
Based on that logic
All play and no work makes Jack very interesting
by that logic we either kill jack or kill work
kill him
definitely
you want work to live and jack to die?
yep
because jack IS a dull boy
and dull boys shouldnt be allowed to live
darwinism at its finest
dafuq
but if we kill work he'll be undull and we wont have to work
we could also kill work
because
you know
then we'd be mass murderers
that would make things easier
1 is the limit
pshh
well then kill jack
nobody liked taht guy in titanic anyway
so
brandon
still down for tacos at like 11?
(alex gets home at 1030)
maybe. i might be asleep by then lol
lol yeah, i figured
its fine if you dont
i was bearly asleep in programming languages
nearly*
i made the meat already and am gonna refrigerate it anyway, so it doesnt need to be eaten right away
in fact, if you want dinner you could just steal some and some chips and salsa or something later if you want
i was asleep in programming languages
lol
not on purpose, i swear
i was so pissed
i actually wanted to go
for once
i ended up just going to my 2:30 class as well
because he was handing back our midterms
ah
i got a 71%
not bad
which was the average
i messed up dijkstra's algorithm >_<
also i still have my dyn programming assignment
I have an A, B, and C. was it a 3 parter?
ah, yes it was
yep
there's also the graduate question and the extra credit, but you may not have those
extra credit was just 2 questions
so i probably turned that in just written down or something
i'll work on that this weekend, too much other stuff to do
due the 3rd?
yeah
it was a pretty big program
idk when else i'll have time
well, part D was 160 lines of code
gotta catch up on labs in cpe since i didnt do one this last weekend, do a hw in there by thursday, do my linear algebra tonight (due tomorrow), work on the design document for my group project game in game design, so yeah :F
that's pretty big
she gave it to us on the 22nd
not really. the hard part is the algorithm
yeah i figured
a lot of that is just C++ being C++ (aka ugly)
indeed
first 90 lines is just class definitions
oh then its not bad at all
yeah but i didn't comment at all on my algorithm lol
i'll figure it out :F
this is some terrible code i wrote
3 magic numbers that mean nothing to me in the algorithm
lol i didn't finish one of my comments
it is just "// The"
lol
i also have a totally useless chunk of code
...
sounds like you really knew c++ well
I knew C++ fine, but this whole rest flag on this class is useless
it is always false
and the function that sets it true is never called
I do check if it is false in an if else though
if(false){
//things
}
else{
//neverhappens
}
to make it even better: if (always true || who cares) { stuff } else { never happening }
lol
oh wait, nvm, it isn't always false
but I do never use the set function
i'd honestly not be suprised to see you in that commercial somewhere
lol
i'd be five
too young
so if i'm reading this right, which I very well probably am most likely not but there's a slight chance I amn, my algorithm just forms a tree of all actions
and then just prints the path with the highest utility
which seems really easy. too easy, considering how long it took me to think of that algorithm
picking the path with highest utility was the hard part for you
you kept trying to do it with greedy algorithms on accident i think
but that's easy
easier than the solution I even wrote here
you literally just traverse up the tree from the leaf node with the highest utility
so then building the tree with the correct values for utility was probably the hard part
yeah but that's easy too
you just.. do it
Nike TM
lol
NNNOOOOVAAAAAA
i pasted this here earlier but it didn't seem to send (from my tablet)
For example, when a participant of the study was told that he had a one-in-thirteen-million chance of contracting the virus, his response was, “Whoa. Thirteen million is a really big number. That is totally scary.”
(about ebola)
lol
lol
spooooky
that's pretty sick
pretty sure i'd shoot the fuck out of that with a shotgun tho
so good luck with repairing your $10000 drone
lol
hey tonizzle you available for a consult/fixup?
yus?
um
what?
need a logo for my group project, our team name is whiteWatch, so i came up with a prototype logo but did it in paint and yeah
lol
gives me an idea
I like ideas
lol
If I took my time i'd have made the text curve along the edge and make the bumps on the wrist part actually even
and changed the font
that font is bad
I've also noticed now that that image is massive
:F
i actually have like
an entirely new idea
orly
yes
still white watch though
if i do it right you'll see
oquay
guys Rails is cool
in a handfull of lines of code, I added an admin view to list all users and a way to edit fields on any user and validate/save the changes to the database
that would have been much harder with php
lol
that's awesome
#morereasonsphpsucks
Guys
php is the best
don't even
lol
no
That was a joke
lol
thatsthejoke.jpg
joke.exe
joke.exe has experienced an error and will now close
I would like to send a report to windows
windowsrepair.exe has experienced an error and will now close
I would like to call my sysadmin
Actually no
your sysadmin is currently unavailable, can I take a message?
I reboot, and launch Ubuntu instead of windows
ggwp
ty ty
brandon you've rooted an android device before havent you?
well, for when you get back, what did you do with it? lol i just rooted my tablet and dunno what to do other than put google play on it
andrew
what format did you need the logo in?
jpg? png? gif?
ANDROID
bleep
blorp
hi sorry, taking alex to work and such, but i'm back
and any format works
wow
that's really cool
like
seriously cool
you don't mind if i steal it and use it in our game, etc? (i'll even credit you in the credits screen and everyone will be like "who tf is anthony humphreys")
nope
awesome
all yours
free and clear
blah de blah
we have a loading screen! lol
lol
is the background transparent or is it white?
bg is transparent
but text is white...
i should fix that
lol
hold up and lemme see how it looks in gamemaker, they handle transparency weird
yeah all that shows up is the black part of the text
wait
maybe not
nope, white text
but the inner watch thingy is transparent sans-black areas
black areas are solid
is it showing well?
lol
umm
sec, screening what it looks like with a blue background
brb5mins
never rooted android before
afaik your tablet still can't be really rooted though
i have it rooted
like
i have superuser access and such
but no unlocked bootloader right?
fully transparent
pop over anything and it blends in
ANYTHING?
so how bout that rocket launsplosion
what?
Blah
Space cargo ship goes boom
also tony how easy would it be to make the whole image white minus the background? like the first one but with the watch filled in white as well
hot damn that's a big explosion
yep
for those who havent seen
tis sad
indeed
nobody hurt at least
we doing taco tuesday?
we could but we have taco stuff already made and stuff
so we could do that instead
it'd be free
also alex works til 1030 again
well, i am starving
but i also bought panda already
alex and I just had canes an hour or so ago
not hard
lol idk what it is but pure white screens before playing a game bug the crap out of me, especially when its dark
cause it just blasts your eyes with the brightest light ever
it's like the white flashes in amnesia
yep
er
the last slash is wrong
but you know
imgur fixes that for you lol
super white
with the blue I think would work: http://imgur.com/0Xxkxwf
i feel like white on blue looks better than black on blue
you could do blue on black and play the Kenny Wayne Sheppard song
lol
that looks epic
that's almost cleaner than a windows loading screen
how'd you come up with the name white watch?
one of our group members was wearing one, and when our teacher said every team needed a name I asked them if they had any ideas, nobody did, so I looked down at his watch and was like fuck it
lol
it's pretty cool for a developer name
White Watch Games
bam
looks epic doesnt it tony? awesome logo man
thank ye sir
how did you do the shading on the arms of the watch? photoshop stuff?
er
yes
basically
it...erm
hold on
lol
make watch vector
make it white
copy and paste behind vector
make that vector black
knock it down
and to the right
blur the black
slant it
whabam
watch
So vector
such drawing
wow
purrrrrrrr
purrrrrrrr
uhhh hello Alex?
haha
no
i was purring at your vectors
that's pretty sweet
I didnt know photoshop could do that so easily
but i guess it makes sense
:F
showed thal the logo (he sent me a link for a cool song)
Thalagyrt: change it to a fist
Thalagyrt: become white power
XD of course
lol
i almost made the filename whitesupremacy.png
did he link you that song brandon?
tbh when i first read "white watch" i thought it was some white supremacy group
kek
i think of Game of Thrones
haha why am I the only one that didnt see it?
lol
Make swastika
profit
pft
but yeah deconstructed shapes ftw
hey man, swastikas are just symbols for good fortune
^
Exactly
We should spread the good fortune everywhere
he linked me that yesterday
its pretty good
i was looking for the rest but couldnt find it
guess the fluid! http://fat.gfycat.com/JointWearyBarebirdbat.gif
headlight fluid?
probably just water right?
water has hydrogen, hydrogen burns
h2o2?
so probably
hydrogen peroxide can be used as a flammible propellent
so I guess you can say that that fuel-member
was
fired
Could be water-methanol for fuel injection
They do use that in high performance engines sometimes
i love how the driver's hand is all like "shoo! shoo!!"
lol
I just found that in a reddit comments section
Its so cringe worthy
lol'd
its so painful
bleh
candy corn on the cob
eww
you fellas up to play a game? just finished my assignment for the night and have two hours of free time
i have to write a few paragraphs for a group paper due tomorrow
group paper? how does that work lol
paper for a group project
ah
seemed like it was some kind of collaborative writing exercise where you all have to type at the same time
playing league
alone? i'm down to try a bit
with group ><
aw
lol
andrew are we doing something for halloween?
ok so
alex works friday
but
we could do something thursday
alex wants to carve pumpkins again
but we only have two
i dont care to carve a pumpkin anyways
lol
if you wanted to join in I think winco is selling them cheap
ah
but it was so fun :F
i dont believe in fun
anyway, we can hang out and stuff since alex'll be working
si
i'm sure we'll find something unfun to do
i'll just hang out in my creepy asian man mask
haha
i'll put my glasses on, grow a stomach (or use a basketball), put on a collared shirt and jeans and say "hehehe."
lol
I:
yo andrewww
venom.jpg
venom.jpg

lol
hi yes this is andog
hello andog

sounds fine to me
we need to grab hand soap anyway
woo
lemme know when you head over, we dont have to leave til like 1010
k
omw
okkkkk
this guy near me has the goofiest laugh i have ever heard
those are fun
like the hyuck hyuck guy from pokemon
remember that weird video with the laughing people?
that was hilarious
eww
god no
that was creepy
lol
you're thinking of the "happy birthday andrew" thing right?
or am I insane
cause that thing was weird as fuck
no
oh
what was it
oh dear
i remember this one
lol
the black dude has the fucking weirdest laugh
https://www.humblebundle.com/ scroll down for free game teleglitch
vgh
thx
and
vgh
oh look they ahve risk of rain
risk of rain is fun
teleglitch is supposedly fun as well
lol the guy after the black guy
oh boy a new kid named connor just shared my youtube channel
oh nvm, same connor
apparently he still loves me
lol
lol
oh btw
thal linked me that song earlier today
hehe
que suprise
lol
the rest of the album is on google play music all access
oh nice
pay3listen?
yes
damn
all access is the paid service
it's what I use
gotcha
where the hell does all this mucus come from!?
lol
obviously from oblivion
wow so apparently the EU account I made in hearthstone because i failed at making an EU account the first time, still wasnt an EU account
so i get to play the tutorial again
:F
man del taco is really bad at giving sauce lately
asked for mild and medium, got medium and hot
did you go again? lol
yeah. i am out of food here lol
and i didnt want to actually buy food
shoulda came over, i still have taco stuff
working on rails stuff, no time to stop!
so you left and got food lol
well, i had to eat
but that was the fastest solution
lol
i was waiting for a bit of code review on my pull request i just put up anyway
so i was blocked for the time being
gotcha
tony, you here?
what'sup
trying to do something with photoshop
go on
it's for a website background
it'll be a transparent image overlaid on a solid color
it's a line of fading boxes evenly spaced descending vertically
so the top of the background has a box/space/box/space etc pattern going downward for a bit while fading out
just to add a bit of texture to the top of the background
what's the issue?
idk how i can evenly space boxes like that in photoshop lol
hm
i guess i could just make one and manually transform them downward by however many pixels
I wouldn't say transform
if you have a selecitron
er
selection
you can actually move the selection down
so start with a select box
place at tippy top
Ctrl+Alt to fill
er
no
Ctrl+backspace
move down
delete
. . .
wait
well isn't that a nifty shortcut
that's overcomplicated
OOH
wait
find a spacing you like
paste that in and over
on it's own layer
i feel like i could also do this with a custom pattern
then go to Select>Color Range
you could
select one of teh alternating colors with the eyedropper
back out of the selection
and theeeenn
select a new layer
and fill with alt+bkspc or ctrl+bckspc
and you can change that layer opacity
got it
tanks
woot
np
I've been Nao's Rubber Duck every once ina  blue moon
Rubber duckie is the best
lol
css is hard

did you ever remove my stuff from that database? lol
no
lol
ugh. my software engineering midterm is tomorrow at 9:30 am :(
eww
yep
hopefully it will be easy
good luck sirrah
dig it
i like the side blurring vignette
helps bring focus to the center
nice touch
thanks :D
i feel like the dashboard area is too flat
sidebar looks a little boring
dude
duuuuuuude
yeah
too bad xbone only
I KNOW
WHAT THE FUCK
we need pc halo!
too bad that will never happen
the moment halo isn't an xbox exclusive, xbox will die
we need a fucking movie
seriously
slightly tweaked styles :D
that logout icon looks like a maximize window icon
you know.. it kinda does
i get what you were going for though
i'll change it later
a big fat X would do
and I saw you were checking out icons
so well done :D
using Gimp is like trying to pain by shoving a painbrush in your eyeball and painting with it
paint*
lol
and faceplanting the canvas?
yes
seriously
what the hell
i took the paint bucket
selected white
clicked it
it made it more black
WAT
selected black, still made it black
is it the backmost layer?
it was the only layer
er
do ctrl i?
on gimp?
gimp is infuriating, i'll just wait till i am home and have photoshop
lol
Miranda Keyes looks weird
I seriously want an xbone just for the master chief collection
mmmeh
imagine all of the halo versions with active multiplayer!
...guhhhhh
dat halo 2 multiplayer
but i don't want xbone :<
yeah
maybe if ps4 keeps beating it in sales, its price will drop even lower
heh
I need a veapun!
trailer is indeed epic
confirmed
the original trailer (or something like that): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5aTOJXL698
wut
indeed
I think it's strange that they haven't made a halo movie yet. Surely it would be profitable
YEAH
apparently Thyth gave a Defcon talk
he doesn't look quite like i imagined
orly
link?
seems nerdy enough
lol
his mouth sounds very wet
oh neat
doesnt he work at google now?
don't know
he was going to apply there last I heard
his website is interesting
his website didnt work on my phone
it just doesnt work
lol
huh
yeah he's about as pro technologically as I expected him to be
his website needs some work. lol
yeahh lol
must be going through an overhaul
it has a cool background and one image, as well as three semi-working buttons
woo
why does his projector make everything pink
you'd think tech conventions would have better tech
:F
blame whatever hotel in vegas hosted it
ah
true
so, fellas
how's it going?
buen
we should play a game or something
we could do that indeed
what play?'
dunno
steam wont launch lol
O.o
odd
lol
there it goes
Amnesia is $5 on steam right now
the good amnesia
it does that a lot
especially around halloween
it's the spooky halloween sale
since its the only good scary game like, ever
penumbra was alright
yeah but we couldnt get it to run so it was just meh
lol
well we got pretty far
then it just crashed
yeah thats what i mean
lol
it was awesome while it worked
Alien Isolation is a beautiful game, but the entire thing is a game of cat and mouse
which I hate
yeah i hate running from stuff
psychological scare is much more fun
it's not running though
like amnesia
if you get to running, you're already dead
it's all just about timing when to run from point a to b
and this level I am at is fraking impossible
there's like 20 robots
lol
they took my guns away before starting the area
i still have emp mines so all is good right?
nope
robots have emp protective suits
oh well. still have pipe bombs
nope
2 pipe bombs to kill 1 robot
impossible!
lol
sounds like running away time
nowhere to run
i feel like playing an fps where my actions are significant
BF4 is fun but it seems like even if I am doing really well I don't really move my team forward much
lol
halo
i miss halo
halo was fun
halo was very fun
we could watch arrows/flash
alex is work
lame
yeah
we caught up on arrow last night though
we watched last weeks
ah very goot
yesh comrade
we need to find a good, free, halo imitation
i just want mister chef collection :F
lol
so
game?
didnt see any god looking games
well there arent very many god looking games
so that'd be why
well in Sims you're basically god
lots of games have god mode too
yeah but you're never really god looking
true
unless you're playing god of war
lol
right now I'm changing something my group member made on our website
he named it reset password but it is actually just change password
because it expects you to enter your old password before changing
gg
so it doesn't really let you reset it if you forgot it
reset should give a random code to their email
yeah, we'd have to set up an email server though
which we can do
but it isnt a primary feature
gotcha
we need to get core functionality in first
yeah
i bet there's a service that does that kind of thing for you
dunno how secure it'd be though
does what? reset tokens?
just sends things for you without making an email server
like
without YOU making it
there are mail services, which cost money monthly
UNR already has a mail server for when we actually deploy this
and setting up a mail server is easy
oh gotcha
we could try playing splinter cell again
wat
I say wat a lot
you do
it was in your word cloud
It was my word cloud
lol
no
everyone's word cloud was lol
^
Besides lol
mine was "lol ok so"
sounds about right
"lol ok so just like"
mine probably had meow or woof on it somewhere
so i've now hit rank 20 with four different hearthstone accounts in one season (one month)
one of which is rank 9
two others are like 17, 14
and the other two are 20
Put that time in war thunder
become pro
but i'm putting it into hearthstone and becoming pro
lol
but you has joystick now
hearthstone feels so much less grindy though
I don't feel like I am grinding in WT
and i feel joy every time i open a pack of cards like i'm a little kid
I just fly whatever I want
yeah
but i want to fly things i dont have
:F
Just get the planes that seem cool to you and have fun
the ones taht seem cool are either biplanes or jets
lol
Right now, my favourite thing to fly is the Ki-61 Outsu, and thats tier II
the machine gun one?
Yes
eww
that one always gets wrecked when i fly it
6 kills in one realistic battle would like to argue with you
I defeated 4 russians at once
but you're right, the one country i don't feel like i'm grinding is japan
1 v 4
and i never fly realistic with them
maybe i should
You should
apparently one of the top realistic players uses only joystick
Japan in realistic is like you are god
lol
and you slay all living things
unless you fly jets
low tier jets
N1K2, J7W1, and Ki-84 all eat F/P-80s
And they're props
and the new R2Y2 jet destroys all its opponents :D
Also, Po-2 event tomorrow
lol
yeah i saw the new jets were good
wanna play a little japanese realistic?
Yes
k
gimme 5 mins
eating dinner
lol
kk
Take your time
I have till like 1:00am
loolol
i have like an hour and a half, then starting at like 11 i'm free all night
Want to just pick up at 11?
if you want
That would be easiest
i've got nothing til like 1015 so either way works
oh wow i thought you meant it was a po-2 only event
not a po-2 earning event
that's cool
races are derp though
yeah
but ki-10
would that even be good in a reserve realistic race?
i feel like the buffalo would be best
if you're good at piloting that is
so i got a kill assist, a ton of hits, and died to a swarm of la-7's and yak-9t's
do you use tracers or air target ammo?
Air targets
no
tracers
for ki-61
tracers are pure apit
Buffalo is not a reserve
er
i meant peashooter
lol
The ki-10 is both the fastest and most manueverable reserve
does it have highest top speed? i didnt actually look lol
it does
interesting
the fury is 2nd by like 6kph
ki-10 masterrace
indeed
do you fly the otsu or kei?
er
not kei
ko
the otsu keeps getting tiered up :(
otsu
the 4x 12.7 one
yeah i keep getting wrecked by tier III's
just flew against corsairs and p47s
and a few p-39s
Are you climbing into space?
yep
but my problem is going down after that
Ah
I seem to fight p47s just fine
and cobras are easy
yeah, the biggest problem was the speed of the corsairs in the last one after a dive, and then there were some f6's that kicked my ass in general
F6Fs are tough, you have to beat them using roll speed to destroy their energy
decosine are you alive
I see you are game
i am now game as well
Ian
Ian
hi
hi
hi
happy nevadalloween

:F
i'd need to steal your muffin tray cooking thingy anyways
but tonight is a late night
lol

green onion would be good on that

no we do not
i think we have malt vinegar or something nasty like that
lol
welp, i have created my shopping list
oh nvm according to alex we're out of that as well
also getting stuff for this: http://www.thugkitchen.com/fresh_corn_and_herb_pasta_salad

LOL look at that
a mig-21
trainer
in the middle of the street
Very komrade

Also basically free rare airplane in war thunder tomorrow
i thought that was today
oh
wow
nice
want to get po-2 with me?
also if i dont get the xf5f or tb-3 i'd be pissed
I got the Po-2 already
oh
only took 3 battles
well then
i'm gonna go fly some
lol
well flights
just use Ki-10 I C
yep
spaceplane extraordinaire
so
dont cook bacon in the oven for 30 minutes
cooking comically lied
wut
little crispy?
30 minutes reduced them to little black.... husks
i only cooked half of it though
oh thats good
redoing it with the other half
yeah just watch it this time lol
so yeah i got 6th
:F
lol
why use the ki 10 i-c?
i used the IIc
er
just the II
I-C has better acceleration when upgraded and weighs less
ah
i just used the 90 eagles i had left to buy the upgrades
lol
didnt have engine injection
Ah
That will make all the differnce
Also
Best fit lines
and you just have to go "near" the hoops
you don't have to even go thru them
andrewww
i need cheese grater
oh yeah
come on over
lol
be there in a sec
got second that time
by .074 seconds
first that time by 5 seconds
everyone died
lol
second place was the only peashooter in the place
whelp
won that one by 9 seconds
i want to enter that race with a po-2 and be like "aww yeah cruisin speed"
they overflowed a little bit
i think a larger muffin tray would have been a good idea. but they look fairly edible
damn
they look delicious
come on over!
doing so promptly sirrah
should i bring something?
i have pepsi
sure
mkay
i also have chips/salsa, those too?
sure
okokok
onmyway
#justdoit
THIS JUST IN, NIKE GOING ON A LEGAL RAMPAGE OVER COLLEGE STUDENT USING THEIR CATCHPHRASE IN A HASHTAG
whelp, one sec, dad called
so jared and his girlfriend are definitely having sex right now
:F
walked in, could hear pretty well
bleh
lol
lol
should make it as awkward as possible for them
nahhhh i'm just gonna stay in my room and put headphones on lol
lol
i'm wearing my asian man mask
it's freaky how every year it becomes a better fit
it's like a glove
for my face
hahaha
your face is growing into it
52 minutes left
mine is ready
check if it has people
i immediately was put in a game
so i think it does
I find it painful to watch the mindcrackers play minecraft
they're all so bad
and so inefficient
watching them play pretty much anything is painful
watching etho play survival of the fittest is even painful
they could take so much less time doing absolutely everything and stick to the cool parts
lol
guude is impossible to watch
i watched an episode of his alien isolation
SOOO OBLIVIOUS
i tried watching bdubs play that flyboys modpack, all flight stuff
THE MOTION TRACKER INDICATES THE EXACT DIRECTION TO WALK!
would have been cool if it wasnt horrible
lol
lol
gg guude
to be fair, he didnt die at that part
that was the same part my first 4 or 5 deaths were
and it was freaking hilarious too
he's just bad at the game. still had a good laugh
yeah
they're funnyish
most of the time
but they're all so bad
lol
i dont watch most of them
andrew
quick
get 3d glasses
a lawnchair
and some popcorn
i watch TTT/Prop Hunt from pause's perspective
just wait outside the door
when they exit, clap
i have 3d glasses
the red/blue kind
even better
lol
or, what you could do is...
just walk in
and say "ignore me, just gotta fix my camera's angle"
then leave
lol
DUDE
ok that'd be epic for someone you hated
lol
btw tony, we're gonna give blacklist another try in about 40 minutes
blacklist?
splinter cell
oh
uhhhh
i dunno how I feel about that
i forgot what things do
well
you point the end with a hole towards the enemy
but it was so fun back in the day that it'd be totally worth it to play :F
and you pull the trigger until they fall to the ground and stop moving
or you walk up behind them
and stick them with the pointy end
i like the pointy end version
dl'd yet?
16 minutes left
wat
for what
SC
blacklist
what wawss tat on again
uplay?
yes
1 minute 30 seconds
woo
well, the game downloaded
now uplay is updating
at 0 B/s
oh good it sped up
lol
yeah
did that to me too
well, I am ready to play it
gimme like 3 minutes, playing a game of hearthstone
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
k ready
im in mumble
WHAT
GUYS
I just saw Fury
on our way with the food brandon
dont worry tony it wasnt that fun. brandon's place is lame
oh tony isnt even on
well
lol
lol
hahahhahahaha
dearie me
lol
i saw my opportunity and i hit the print screen button
brilliant
too bad it wasnt a gif, i was making some funny faces
i could arrange a gif
Free plane
only 5 kills needed
collect now
lol
also I got the stupid floating He-51 :(
are any of those american planes?
Yes
XF5F
is it good?
Super fast and turns great
you have a 20% chance of getting it
is it as good as an air cobra?
oh i dont get to pick? :(
nope :/
Or I would have picked the TB-3
it's so weird rewatching us on the motion camera
especially without any sound
lol Andrew, I could definitely make a gif of you running to the camera
but I will do it tomorrow
lol
gifmebro
Ian
i'd have to install a bunch of crapware to make the gif I discovered
star citizen FPS module
Ian
welp, I'd say that was a good day's work
implemented courses on my senior project, and students can now enroll in them and see a list of their enrolled courses
nice
not much fun huh?
o hey!
ohai! o/
alphas are weird
Played EVOLVE
fun
but
i got rocked
started evolving
srcreen blacked out
evolved echolocation
lost eyesight in process
yeah
evolved armor, health, and attack damage
lose eyesightand feeling
lol
that actually happens? lol
lol no
alpha
i bugged out
lol
game forced windows into basic mode for apearance adn made it impossible to go back
last night a face hugger got me in Alien Isolation and my game crashed
hard core game over
lol
are you fucking sorry?!
idk but I'm very dead
I walked in the room and was like "why did those boxes fall over?"
then about 1/2 a second later I scramed and nearly threw my mouse
?
oh lol
Well I had a dream involving a construction of a room with shower, gardening, sylverster stallone, hostages, flying, paris and a tsunami
a room with all of paris? wow
:/ I don't actually know where in Paris but the architecture and language was french
Dream logic
lol
is pretty tasty
more of a side dish though
Looks easy enough and that
But food processor ugh
lol
i just used a blender on low
Yeah I have both, I shouldn't complain.. it's just the dishes
lol
got most of it in house :D will try
thx for ze tip
The dill is kinda over powering
if I made it again I'd really reduce the amount of dill
Will season it the dutch way = lightly ;p
lol
Another easy dish is preboiled potatoes in cubes, seasoned with chilipepper, chiliflakes, dash of salt, fresh garlic, olive (or any other) oil. Place in oven for 45 mins at 180C, drizzle some lime with coriander over and serve.
*drools*
lol :P
my mom is making pot roast
still in crock pot
smells like heaven
now i'm drooling
so hungry
It's food for the time of year
darn right.... and this might be one of the last days of cold before it gets way too freaking hot for autumn again
winter is coming
here in reno
lol winter
california says lolno to that
reno says "snow snow snow ice snow" to that
supposed to hit mid-high 90's again
>.<
we were lucky enough to have 2 days of sun through the weekend
it's sunny and a nice chilly 62F out
such a nice change ^_^
I'm happyas long as it's a bit stable and not too freakty
freaky*
youd hate living here
lol
I wouldn't mind living near the coast though
reno is terrible with lots of wind and cold and yuck
haha wind
but I have less than a year left here so wooooooo
brace yourselves, the santa anas are coming
hold onto your small children
they might be blown away
i read that as "Santa anus" and was really confused
lol
I have no idea who that is
Santana? xD
haha
santa ana is a city near the coast that has nothing to do with the winds
yeah. Carlos
but for some reason they call it that
Or is it the non racist version of saint nicolas
ah
but winds are usually a steady 30 mph with gusts of 50-60
and dry as fuuuuuuu
hmm dry
basically, allergy season on crack
Yeah that's what I was afraid of
the sad part is we're in the middle of record droughts and got our first real rain of the year last week
and the winds are coming to ruin that
we've had higher temperatures than normal, 5 degree difference
temperatures are a bit above average here
Thx Obama
it was cold the past few days but it's warming up again
but for some reason september and october are our hottest months
always
Hopefully it'll calm down a bit. Hurricane season should be officially over
but with higher than normal temeratures anything is possible.
I should get some rest, g'night!
night
I made chili
from scratch
its now in the  pot
doing chili stuff
chili = yum
brandog
art thou of the hunger?
the peoples of house C-102 are going to traverse the abyss into an extremely cheap dinner of 20% off dennys if you would enjoy accompanying us
Ewww dennys
Isn't there some cheap mom and pop dinner near you guys?
You should find one
there is joe's
and mel's
but dennys has crazy coupons atm
andrew: sure
I also have pasta salad
if you want some
it did sound good
but we should save that
yeah
well, i am ready to go when you are
although i just cut a lemon
so i should eat that first
apparently I have a cut on my lip
TIL
ouch
lol
Lesson from a Lemon
by Brandon Worl
so painful, so good
lol
you just eat lemons?
yes
gross
we're ready when you are
just head over
jared's coming too
also do you mind going to target after?
sure
we all need some stuff
ok cool
lemme finish this lemon
so, this senior project requires that, in the finished product, each team member must have contributed at least 500 lines of code
I have almost  lines myself, so far
with another 1300ish by my other team member
lol
How are the comments
we don't comment
the code is easy to read
oh
I finished about 15% of the project's overall functionality over this past weekend though. We have until around April to finish it all. lol
i challenge you to land a swastika on the moon
bonus points proportional to the size of the swastika
1 point per meter
oooo
What if it was a space station moon swastika?
that seems easier than a surface moon swastika
Okay
Moon swastika then
lol
hmmm
so much effort though
Well
Not really
Just the resistence of the shape in the atmosphere
lol
Atempts 1-3 have been destroyed by the atmosphere
you could attach each piece as a small detachable drone and assemble it all together once it's beyond the atmosphere
that would take forever though
lol
welp, time to hopefully beat Alien Isolation
that was a strange ending
lol
im a hipster programmer
not a hipster designer though
offic emax derp
that person is a hipster designer
Someone brought up that it was an issue that the text of something on ONE side would go over the frame ont eh OTHER side
so Titanfall is $10
not bad
lol
it was just alright
lol
I'm not suprised the price has dropped
it was a next gen hype title
I hate low temperatures and winter
yep
I want my 90 degrees back
I'd like around 75
what the hell is wrong with you
75 good
best temp
ian is weird
masterrace
I made rice and it wasn't terrible! :D
What kind of rice?
japanese short grain
Good stuff
That's what I eat
last time i made it, it was all gooey and nasty
Too much water
and not enough polishing
I also let it sit in the water for 20 minutes before turning the rice cooker on this time
I cook mine in a pot
so it heats up with the water
same effect
lemme guess, one of the top 5 comments was something along the lines of "with names like those i'd commit capital murder too"
nope
whelp
with one of those names i'd commit capital murder too
"This is some Hingle McCringleberry level shenanigans."
lol
Stereotypes are once again supported by reality
"My neighbors name is Pooticia and everone calls her Pooty or Poo. I swear to you."
"Saggitariutt Jefferspin[1]  "
"Ozmataz Buckshank"
"X-wing@alicousness"
were the top 5
whelp, coulda saw that coming as well
lol
my personal favorite from that lineup is "torque (ratchet noises) lewith"
he went to nevada state penetentiary
Shall I examine his record?
yes
okay
"No matching results were found."
he's not real :F
dangit andrew!
that was gonna be fun
oh
sorry
:F
I meant, "well that's odd, he definitely went there before his pro football career"
god
did you see the part 2 part?
yeah it wasnt quite as good. but it was still funny
they're all amazing
south flurrida
D'squarius green jr.
Jackmerius Tacktheratrix
lol
Davoin shower-handel
Ya know Key and Peele were in the White and Nerdy music video?
yep
they're also both in a few movies (separately mostly) but they're funny
[8:20:02 PM] Anthony Humphreys: Ya know Key and Peele were in the White and Nerdy music video?
So was Donny Osmond
that's awesome
He has the best part too
He's that weirdo backup dancer behind Al
Sad thing is
I just watched that
and I am roughly that white
don't know if I am that nerdy though
lol those are awesome
lol
Apparently it only took me 13.8 hours to beat Alien Isolation. I thought it took more like 20
lol
also
that lamp
isnt it a great lamp?
it is a great lamp
really brightens one's day
look at them, tony
real people agreeing that those cookies are great
the best, even
pft
they wanted sewing supplies
not cookies
"Those are THE BEST cookies. I just love them" - Mrsdoralice
Hmm have they ever had chocolate chip or oatmeal cookies?
oatmeal and choc chip have nothing on danish butter cookies
I could eat an entire tin of those easy
They are good though :P
"I actually agree with you, from all the traditional religions, Judaism seems the most forward to me. It values science and education, its not homophobic and misogynist as Christianity and Islamism. And jews can be quite reasonable. But its hard to let go of this tradition." - Mrsdoralice
"only 1% of uncut boys will ever have a infection due the foreskin, less than 1% of men will ever need circumcision due phimosis and HIV prevention is done with condoms, not surgery.
Yet, they have no idea about penile adhesions, meatal stenosis, buried penis, problems that affects almost 10% of cut boys.
But I blame our medical community for this horrible misinformation." - Mrsdoralice
sounds like an open minded individual
wat
at least they are able to form coherent opinions and discuss them in a civil manner?
yup, they can form opinions alright
like the opinion that those cookies are tasty
ok, well how about this
"OMG I love those cookies!! Mmmmm so jelly right now! Teehee! ;)" - plasticsinkbarbie
"that poor helmet! O_O" - plasticsinkbarbie, on a wreckage photo
sounds like a caring individual
very caring apparently
a lot of her comments are "aww"
"Someone during class said the Air Guitar man died during that thunder storm! Is that true???" - plasticsinkbarbie
"I saw this same guy from my last post Air drumming at a stop light, I guess he is a local San Angelo'n!?!?!?! XD Then I saw another person air drumming in a different car. OMG so crazy much! What do yall people think?" - same chick
at least she knows a good cookie when she sees one
"Wrong. Step one: Remove pants. Step two: Eat cookies on couch pantless. " - Mr0lsen
he knows what's up
he's a brother of the pc master race
he is a brother
also a patriot
sounds like a pretty cool guy
the kind of guy who would know a good cookie when he sees one
so we have an intellectual, a caring person, and a brother who all endorse dutch butter cookies
danish?
whatever
*danish
lol
lol
you have a political activist, a twit, and a brother
1/3 ain't bad
"Danish butter cookies are the best" - Naosyth
That guy also likes blended taquitos
A VISIONARY!
lol
for real though i have taquitos in my freezer and I may just end up blending a few in to a nice sauce
blended taquitos: amazing
danish butter cookies: not so much
that actually looks... really cool
it'll be 4k on pc
who has a 4k monitor though?
lol
yehhhh...
fleeing for food and whatnot, tanks for the LoLfun
hokay
tanks as well
I think i'm gonna save up for wukong
he was fairly fast paced and fun to jump around with
lol he's fun in toplane
I still really havent figured out the difference between the three lanes lol
ok
there are 5 *typical*  roles
Top Lane Attack Damage (AD)
Mid Lane Ability Power (AP)
Bottom Lane Attack Damage Carry (ADC)
Bottom Lane Support
Jungle
gotcha
Top AD is usually 1v1 in their lane
they build up attack damage
they get more farm (minion/creep kills) and can build better items to just ruin people
Attack Damage is also what takes out turrets/inhibitors/nexus fast
since it's a "basic attack"
Mid Lane AP is heavy damage dealer to enemy champs
great in team fights
they're usually squishy and will go for other squishies
since they deal the damage
Support is supposed to "feed" the AD Carry
Support basically whittles minions down and goes for crowd control
gets the ADC to kill off champions and minions
gets them a LOT of cash
Jungler is complex
they can be ap or ad
usually ap
they get money from killing the little monster/minions in the jungle
with all the tress in between the lanes
they roam and can finish off champions
good if you like surprising people
I bought 2 tins of danish butter cookies
everyone i gave one to loved them
including Andrew
is everyone like 3 people?
yes
lol
not including me
i forgot his name
androo's roommate
no
Andrew, Bisby, and uhh
i forgot her name
bisby?
sounds like some sort of pasta
Penne
nope
Ragatto? maybe
Rigatone?
Tony?
no
definitely ended in an o
i don't kno
ruffetto
also thanks for the lowdown on lanes mez
makes sense now
any idea why they're structured that way? the lanes seem pretty similarly structured so it seems weird that they're so standardized
no prob
well
there's hidden shit
bottom lane has 2 bushes
top lane has 3
bottom turret is also stronger/more defense
interesting
i don't know if it was initially by design or it just happened
kinda cool
i think it'd be neat to take an actual team into some pvp and change it up and see if we can catch some people seriously off guard
lol breaking the meta
yes you can
if your'e good enough
you fuck everyone up
problem is
meta is so ingrained that we'd have to establish a new set of rules
like all mid for example
frightening for turrets but that means they can farm
etc.
oh man
I just won a war thunder match 5 v 1
Me in my Venom
vs
5x MiG-15bis
Totally thought I was dead
venom OP
plot twist
you are
lol
honestly i'm not that surprised
Plot twist I am what
mig15 operates wayyyy better at super high altitudes, and your plane works well at medium-low altitudes
plus you're a good pilot
I forced them to fight down low
yeah
definitely not surprised
pretty cool though
5v1
venom just outturns and accelerates the migs at low altitude doesnt it?
Yes
And outclimbs
50m/s in the Venom
Killed 2 of them as they tried to climb away
lol
not a whole lot of those are actually secret
other than like the nachos and the cilantro and I guess the free tortillas and stuff
lol
but yeah
I'd like to try the cilantro thing
the quesarito and stuff are pretty well known
and I almost always get my burrito double wrapped
i didnt know about them :l
lol
well now you do
Ricardos sounds better
it does sound better
Andrew/Brandoni/Toni we must plan-oni a trip-eroni to Ricardoni's
we can also do not-ricardos
where is is midtown where we can all meet?
not that I dislike ricardos
but maybe it'd be easier to go from ricardos to something else
if we wanted to hang
since Ricardos is like...dead center
Ricardos is just placed right between us
anywhere near there that's also near something else?
We could go to Holstein's in the Cosmopolitan
They have good hamburgers
that's in the middle as well
i'll be down for a couple days around new years
so we should plan around that if possible
Yes I agree
When will you be here?
I will be in vegas for thanksgiving, but I'll likely be pretty busy
I might be leaving town then
woot
wait not woot
i heard amazing things about holsteins
still need to go
Ian
I'd like your stalking skills
so good that he can stalk imaginary people
??
so fast that he can research your history in five minutes
lol
it's IAN!!! THE FASTEST STALKER ALIVE
WOOOOOOOO
GO IANNNNN
ki'mdone
:F
lol hello sir
hola
I want to play LoL
ok
do you have the time?
but I also want to pass my classes
lol
ah
pass your classes then we can rock lol
hehe
yeah
I have to write a 2-4 page paper on verilog and vhdl tutorials by tomorrow
should only take an hour or two once i'm done researching wtf verilog and vgdl are
lol
and after that?
maybe you and brandon and i can run a game or something
that would be fun
I'll probably be able to at some point soon cause i'll need like an hour break from reading tutorials
good god
too
no
to
fixed
how did I even
stahp
I never do that
lol
stop
lol
seriously though this gent is strange
whodat?
aaron galant?
no clue
lol
i'm no pro stalker :(
hence my request of the mastah
but he's away
indeed. he seems to come back to us around 5pm or so normally
wat is verilog and why do i know that word?
verilog
oops this isnt google
lol
its a hardware design language
i've seen it before but i'm not sure where
probably 301
probably
LoL later?
probably not today
aww
i'm almost done this essay already
imma do my networking homework and then we have arrow later
laaaaaame
yur lame
nawww
what's the networking assignment?
dunno
lol
havent looked
networking assignment: play LoL with andrew and tony
heh
both computer and human networking involved
you'd have 40 random people also show up then
gg class
well they don't have to play with specifically this tony and andrew
just a tony and an andrew
XD
seen it :P
i love C&H
these cookies. these sour strips. it is my new diet.
this fucking guy
117 gold
118 now actually
damn
people must really want this dude's info
is he a big LoLer or something?
thefuck
lol
gold for lyfe
poor bjergsen
dude
all questions are for the guy who posted the master list
lol
it's the most gilded comment in reddit history
lol
previous max was only 71
wow
yeah
i think they're gonna make it to 400
has it even hit the front page yet?
oh, it has
but the posts about the gold haven't
Hi I am back from work
I hear stalking is required?
er
yeah
Aaron Gallant
Anything else?
(Like a state or city?)
has the handle "foxamg"
in las vegas nevada
his favorite color is green
knows a crystal rivas
Oh okay
I can do that
The handle should REALLY help actually
wut he does Towing?
no idea
nope
different aaron
Age?
Also is his actual first name Michael?
Wait a sec
I thought his first name was bisby
i am almost out of sour tape :(
There is a problem here
Everything that I find registared to "foxamg"
has the name "Aaron Gazlay" attached to it
@foxamg on twitter is just a bot or something
every post has a mysterious tinyurl with it
and is clearly fishing for clicks
Problem is, there is a linkedin and a photobucket attached to "foxamg" and "Aaron Gazlay" as well
Which leads me to think that its all one person
probably
Though the twitter is clearly botted
why do you want this person stalked, tony?
Also are you sure the handle is correct?
also are you sure his favorite color is green?
that was his email address
he's contracting me
"going to" contract me
About what exactly?
have you met him in person? how did you meet him?
didn't meet him
friend referred him to me becase he needed graphics
he ends every sentence with an elipse
lol
Hey....
Thanks for responding...
I got a job for you....
it's fucking creepy is all
yeah
the twitter account with that username is a scam/spam account
and belongs to a person with a similar name
so
...hm
foxamg is all connected to the other name
Aaron
Galzay
not Gallant
two people named aaron by the same handle with last names starting with "Gal"
^
Hyper fishy
Besides that there are no Nevada criminal records on either person
so fishy they named a fish place after him
and a whole series of desks
actually they stopped producing those
probably because they were a little fishy and nobody bought them
actually like EVERYONE on /r/battlestations had that desk
lol
i like how the answer dude has only 2 gold
lol
lol? sure, sounds like a good idea brandon lets do that
lol
wait i just realized that mufugga has almos 2 y ears of gold
what the shit
i thought each gold was worth a month?
he has 17.5 years of gold
O.O
nonsense
each gold is worth a month
isn't it?
30 days
ooooooh
i was donig the 12 mo thing
right right
so basically a month
that is insane
LoL didnt take hours to update this time
woo
tony are you available for some LoL?
hey brandon alex wants to know if you're going to use that basil you have (if there's any left) because she would love to if you're not
i am not and there is
can she come steal some and maybe some dill salad?
sure
i am
wan2mumble?
sure
no more lolligaggin?
loligaggin with others
andrew is eating i think
i bet he's eating basil
lol
loligaggin
nope, pizza
alex made spinach orzo though
for dinners later this week
which is what the basil was for
we can watch arrow now if we want
how?
it aired hours ago east coast
oh right
so it's on the internet
would you mind waiting til like 10ish? alex wants to shower first
sure
oquay coolio
oh
you are mumble
i will mumble and LoL in second
no loligaggin
mez
leggo
we have 1 haur
one hower
you two play in a bot game
still
trying... :<
i'm getting so outplayed
you both try a bot game
and see how ya guys do without me :3
we won :D
3/9/3 not nearly as good as with you tony lol
you tell me when to gtfo and stuff
3/4/5
which keeps me from dead
yeah andrew kept running in to turrets and dying
well ashe and lux were one hit from dead so i chased them through their turret to try and get a nimbus strike in on them, but i'd just get turreted too quickly to finish them
still fun
k arrow
lol
333 gold
Poor Benadryl
410 gold
some guy said he would eat a dick if it got too 400 gold. he said that before it even had like 10 gold
syphyllis cankersore
great name
so apparently the champion I was looking into using (fiora) is like universally hated and called useless
lol
maybe
it's good to try them out during free weeks
yeah, i'm still trying to figure out why my free ones are different than the official free ones
hi
hi
whatcha doin?
eating danish butter cookies
yum
want to laugh out loud a bit?
no
i dont lile laughter and cheer
nobody does
but i'd like to play a game
lol?
yes
lol
but i am also STARVING
so lemme go put a pot pie in the oven
come grab some pasta
I made a bunch
what kind?
just whole grain penne with red sauce
do you mind if i steal some?
not atall
well then
omw
lol
lol
i'll warm some up, just put it in the fridge
lol brandon, your assigned advisor for cs is yaakov
mine is hung la
(based on last name)
yuck
ov
varol
also who the hell is hung la
he has an office on the third floor of sem
no idea who he actually is though
maybe he's just a research professor
ah
he's brand new
great
I have a brand new guy to advise me on what to take at a university that he's been at for a few months
:F
lol
just be like me and don't get advised
yeah, but my situation is different cause i'm like in-between years in the major
like i'm taking stuff sophomores and freshman take, as well as what seniors take
anywho
i'm hopping on mumble
not really, other than maybe CH
but even then a lot of upper classmen take CH
cpe301, cs328, analysis, most of those are frosh/soph classes
there's a lot of seniors in analysis
then i'm going into operating systems and sys-admin and stuff
i guess
and mostly juniors in OS
TBH there's like no order to any of the tech electives
yeah
true
still feels like i'm in a weird spot
lol
I want Elite Dangerous
We're on lol tony
o rly
Hey Brandon
?
Want to buy Courtney's soul?
what'll it cost me?
Dunno
What's yer offer
I like Mexican food
blended taquito dip?
I'm afraid that won't do it
That sounds more gross than her soul
is she a redhead?
^
tony:
always the first question to ask when dealing in souls
LoL is cancer
like Dota and WoW
wait... doctors playing LoL?
watisthis
nao and ap, you fools need to add me
lol
oh yeah we can 4 team now
oh IIIIIIAN :D
I don't think he'll ever join LoL actually. :x he did call it a cancer
indeed
Its is Cancer
multiplayer battle arena games are cancer
filled with cancer sometimes
people do get toxic
but i like the teamplays
why the hell do i not have ccleaner on this computer?
*downloads*
some people should start playing PoE again with me too
schooled some scrub yesterday when he tried to pvp my current char
was great
lol
you kinda win at PoE
i'm so behind in that game
my current char is lvl 48 or 49 atm
but has like 5k DPS
so this poor guy invites me to duel
and im like awwyissss
i ended up going 5-1
2shot him
would have 1shot if i crit though
lol
lol @ 3 minute mark
lol
that would totally be Andrew
xD
lol i'm literally watching this just now
it looks like 6v6 TF2 pixar style
lol yeah
looks like a good game
yeah
mehbeh
there was bone in my pot pie
ew
this is so strange
I have a group member on my HCI project who is both competent and proactive. He's actually started the project and made decent progress
lol weird isn't it?
yeah
My senior project group is pretty good too
it's weird having teammates who contribute
lol
i'm still kinda into PoE when i have time
also
greatest movie I've ever seen
of all time
like
seriously
Interstellar
so
brandon
hi
if you want to see it
i do
i will go with you
because i want to see it again
lol
lol
um
really?
Interstellar?
I just said yesterday that I wanted to see it :F lol
or day before
whenever that was
yeah i know
so i'll go see it with you
alex and I had an impromptu date, just kind of ended up seeing it
maybe
lemme know how it goes
sees that Metro is free for steam on humblebundle
goes to redeem teh free code
already has that game apparently.
#PCMRProblems
lol
x_x
this datetime picker plugin has a ton of config options
none of which are for timezone
odd
what DOES it do then?
well i can set a year offset
the default value is something about Buddha
lol wut
dealing with timezones is always unpleasant
since the web server may run in a different time zone than the client
has to be handled client side. which means I'll have to refresh myself on coffeescript
ouchie
whelp
off to bed
I had something to mention but i forget what it was
._.
?
at his mentioning of things
hey man
don't ._. my mentioning
alright?
._.
not cool
jeez
lol
whatcha been up to?
binge watching The 100
also working on project
what's the 100?
It's like nuclear apocalypse lord of the flies pilgrims
lol
pilgrims from space*
aha
seems interesting
first season is on netflix
it's a CW show
airs after arrow on wednesdays
oh nice
might have to check it out with alex
the acting is typical sci-fi tv show quality
well that sounds promising
lol
but it's good
lol
i
want
to
see
interstellar
again
:F
lol
when?
idk
i'm busy all this weekend
and next weekend except sunday
could probably fit it in somewhere though
(what she said)
also
found out the dude's real name
is it albatross dungoode?
(literally the first thing that came to mind)
who's ming?
oh hi
lol
What's his real name?
definitely "saidsomething thenleft"
oh sorry
Aaron Gazlay
CALLED IT
why did you have a fake name?
Everything that I find registared to "foxamg"
[11/5/ 5:24:56 PM] Ian: has the name "Aaron Gazlay" attached to it
oh snit
o.o
well that's him lol
what a botter
twitbotter
bottwitter
anything sketchy though?
bottwatter
Besides a fake name no
twitter scam botting
yaaaay
good call ian
so the new minez 2 looks kinda fun
less hax pvp noobs and death
more exploration, cool map, quests, etc
would be fun to try it out
indeed it would
they still have stacking issues I guess though
starcraft global finals are on
this is actually quite exciting
and i have no idea what things are past a basic understanding in SCII
Finished first season of The 100. It suggested I now watch The 4400
lol
my character was Robert Neville from I am Legend, and it actually guessed it
I was impressed
it got really close for mine
who was it?
I did Jun, the sniper in halo reach
it guessed Emile, the shotgunner/explosives expert
that's pretty good
dunno how he got that, he asked earlier if he was a sniper and I said yes
Jun is the only sniper
lol
he asked if my person was black. i said no
his last question "is your person white?"
"Is the character from the "halo" universe" was like the sixth question
haha
imma try Sam Fisher. Maybe he'll confuse him with Mr. Snake, Solid
lol
I want to do something
"does your character wear goggles?" I think he's on to me
say no, they're a high tech night vision headpiece, not goggles. jeez what a noob
i said yes but he seems to have no clue any more
I think at a certain point he has it figured out but just asks filler questions til he's at 25 for extra accuracy just in case
he answered two of line in like 16
of mine*
hmm
damn
he got it
it took him 25 for mine, and he asked if he was bald or had a shaved head at least twice per question
lol
I kept saying i don't know because i couldnt remember if jun was bald or not
i'd have gone with probably
since pretty much every male in the halo universe has a shaved head
shaved yes, bald no
that's why i said idk
i thought the question was shaved or bald?
or was it two different questios
two different questions each asked twice
lol
lol
I want to LoL i think
maybe
soon
I kinda want to try playing against humans
welp, I have watched every aired episode of The 100 now.
time to wait 1 week inbetween episodes :(
lol
definitely the worst part of watching tv shows that aren't over
didnt mircea say our next hw only had a week til it was due, not two like normal? due date on the hw says the 19th
that sounds familiar
although
that may have been the previous homework
no he definitely said that about this homework
previous was assigned 27th due 5th
thats about 1 week
yeah but i don't think that was it
because I never went to class between assignment and due date, so i never would have heard him say we only had a week
well
it kinda sounds familiar
lol
buuut
homework says due 19th
so does website
due 19th, not gonna complain :P
it's strange though
i checked the website earlier today
and could have sworn it was due wednesday next week when i looked
lol
lol
we'll find out monday i guess
not like we'd start on it before then anyway
it looks like it'll be easy enough
next week I ony have HCI/SE once \o/
lol yay
I don't have any hw due in cpe or linear because of that as well
so yay
again
would you like to join me in a LoLigagging adventure or two?
sure
oquay
It did not guess Emperor Franz II of Austria
That guessing thing
so not only was nancy's sysadmin class waitlisted, I don't have the prereq for it (Op sys) so I had to add the other beginning astronomy class instead
:F
Astronomy doesn't contribute to your graduation requirements though
i wonder why nancy's class is closed
it only has 16 people in it
capacity is 32
there's the grad section to it as well
that's probably why
yeah but there's usually only like 5 grad students in those types of courses
any suggestions for classes I could/need to take?
automata :F
mynevada probably reserves an equal amount even though its not gonna be that way
There are some IS courses that count as CS tech electives
I'm definitely interested in tech electives
because i'm relatively low on those credits
There's an IS course about MySQL
you'll have to contact the professor to get the pre-reqs dropped
if you want to take it
database design and implementation?
i think so
I've never taken an IS course so I don't know what it would be like
I have a friend who's taking it next semester though
what about richard kelley's classes, the topics ones?
it's very math heavy
that's the fluid dynamics/drones one
he's only teaching one class, but he's listed twice for some reason
he's teaching a directed study in machine learning as well?
what about pattern recognition with bebis? is he really that bad?
he is, and i think CV is a pre-req
nope
just cs 202 and stats
but no, he isnt teahcing machine learning
only the one class
gotcha
pattern recognition is much harder than CV, according to everything anyone has said
i'd avoid taking it
yeah it looks horrible by the description
i'll just take the second half of senior projects with you! :D
lol
you would probably be fine with automata honestly
it may bore you to death with Varol, but the content isn't particularly hard
yeah but its actually semi-important to learn and yaakov is horribad
unless he decides to include more proofs than Nancy
what about robotics with feil-seifer?
never had him as a teacher but he seems cool
it would probably be a tough class
probably, but at least it'd be interesting
yes but it would also probably be super time consuming
well fuck
i can't even do automata
conflicts with engr 301
any CPE 300+ classes look good?
embedded games is fall only sadly
dont we need to take computer network systems?
cpe 401
uhhh
isnt it CPE 400?
401 on mynevada
taught by mehmet
i'm in it and it is 400 :F
lol
unless 400 is just a very similarly named course
but yes, CPE 400(+/- 1) is required
it's the followup to 400 I guess
not required
and 400 is only in fall
whelp
looks like i'm taking astronomy
there's really no reason to take it vs not taking anything in its place though
financial aid pulls their support now if you're not at 15+ credits
I thought it was 12+?
unless you're graduating soon
not anymore
I see
well I kinda don't expect any aid at 6 credits next semester. lol
you never know
lol
I find it extremely annoying how few options we have for tech electives each semester
there are four this next semester
there are more than that
like what
anything that is CS/CPE >= 300 that isn't required is a tech elective
Actually, there's something about pirates that i believe counts as a tech elective for us
sec
looking it up
game engines, numerical methods, pattern recognition, three topics classes
so there are six
+ CPE stuff
there aren't any really
+ potential IS stuff
not that we have the prereqs for
or that I do anywya
401 needs 400
and that was the only one I could have taken
ah damn. the pirates one is only a 200 level course
that sounds awesome
yeah
he came and talked in our AI course
he's using AI to document historical documents
wow
that's cool
you should take that with me :P
but there are actually a good amount of random courses that count as tech electives that arent CS/CPE
I could take it
where do we find this list?
lol
because ive looked
i'm not sure if my nevada lists them or not
i will look
EE and MATH >= 300 also work
k, i enrolled in that pirate class, it'll be more fun and applicable than astronomy at the very least
does diffeq work?
is it > 300?
yeah
then i'd imagine so
hmm why does my nevada say I still need 1 more CS course to graduate..
diffeq sounds like such bs
probably because you skipped 135
it says i need 12 and have taken 11
it includes ones you're enrolled in as well
before enrolling in my 2 courses for next semester it said i had 10 and needed 12
what did you enroll in?
i'm in both but still says I need one
senior projects and...?
CS 447 and Senior Projects
nancy's class
interesting
senior projects is definitely cs
:F
lol
yes
and it is listed here as one of the 11
is nancy's?
nope
but it is listed on my tech elective thing
maybe it's referring to required cs courses
135 is supposed to be on that list
maybe
well, it says "The following courses may be used to satisfy this requirement:
and it proceeds to list 11 courses
not 12
interesting
the current course catalog isn't correct for me so I can't just look it up :F
they have archived versions for your year
also I only need 10 of those
not 12
does it list ones you haven't taken or enrolled in?
like automata?
umm
does what list it?
mynevada?
or the archived versions
my.nevada under academic requirements -> view my requirements -> CS & E Major Requirements / CS II
it says 10 required, 8 taken, 2 needed, and lists courses that I am either done with or enrolled in
I see
I wonder if I need to take CPE 411R
cpe 201, cpe 301, cs 219, cs 326, cs 365, cs 446, cs 477, engr 100
well, 411 isn't offered next semester
sooo
i'm missing automata and cpe 400
the catalog says 411 is offered every spring though
hit view course list at the beginning of the list of your taken/enrolled classes there
i dont see a view course list
where that is, mine just says "CS II" and it isnt clickable
interesting
well then
i'd email yaakov
since he's your advisor
yuck
i'll ask Harris
lol
so
anyway
you should take that pirates class with me
but i don't need it :F
but it'll be fun :F
"fun"
yes fun
i might take intro to proofs
math 301
eww
oh nvm
930 am
can't do proofs that early
all time is always too early for proofs
i feel like diff eq would be horrible
math is horrible
on a scale of 1 to fuckthat how bad was cv and on a scale of nope to maybe should I take it or not?
it's a lot of work and you don't want to skip that class
a LOT of work
i'm not going to have time for a lot of work with OS, game engines, and engr comm
all three of those are like 99% projects
os just has the one project towards the end which isn't super bad
game engine just depends on how nice of a game you want to make
engr comm isn't bad except for the whole school visit thing
how the fuck does leverington have a 4.3 on ratemyprof
he's the only cs teacher with higher than 3.1, and that's nancy
oh
nvm
surely richard is higher?
but he is the highest of them all
oh nope
dascalu is 4.7
wat
oh
richard is 5.0
nvm
thank god
overlord richard
lol
if dascalu beat richard i'd cry
lol
yaakov is the lowest with 2.4
other than carl looney, but he doesnt teach here anymore
lol
stupid rails wont include this plugin file
stupid rails
keeps derailing the train
wait waddafak it is including it
y it no work then
did you have ramazan for something? birant ramazan
the name sounds familiar
no, but everyone loves him
he's teaching theory of positive integers
i heard that class isn't too bad
i'm just gonna stick with my current schedule
it sucks, but i'm still on track
so meh
taco saladddddd
sounds delicious
it is
i've been trying to remember what these things were called for years
OH MAN
I remember those
yeah, I used to have them packed in my lunch back in the day
I've been wondering what they were called for like 10+ years
wow
Clearly they are discontinued now though
yeah
Gushers were better anyway
idk man
those were the shit
something about the strings
and gushers had one or two flavors that I didnt like
remember I was talking about those last time we were at winco?
and they melted
yes
lol
or time before, whenever that was
gushers are like teeth cement
I've never had a string thing
Eww you guys shop at winco?
food ghetto ftw
String Things were great
[7:34:46 PM] : food ghetto ftw
I now have a new name for winco
lol
called it that since one showed up near my house in california
all the ghetto everywhere is at winco 100% of the time
I shop at Trader Joes/Whole Foods
guaranteed or your money back in your pocket
both of those cost more than my nonsalary as a college student with no job
but if i had the cash i'd go there for sure
Ian is one of those fancy 1%ers that only shops at fancy places
way better
Iam? who is Iam?
i think he makes dog food
oh right
Iam's
lol
I might be
I buy my clothes from Banana Republic too
all the women in my women's studies class hated banana republic
because of its labor practices
lol
Does that make me evil?
Or a hero?
well, you are evil, but no
My response was "it sucks. doesn't mean i'll stop shopping there or similar places. out of sight out of mind"
that might be a bit more blunt than I put it
but same idea
in a room full of women, i'm sure you werent' that blunt
lol
it was online
lol
I was asked how I felt about Jackie Robinson in my US History corse
well then
i'd have been more blunt
My reply was: "I'm not black and I hate baseball, so I really don't care"
lol
"fuck bitches get money shop at banana republic because low labor prices keep my costs low"
^
"Gap sucks" ?
Except the coat I bought there was $220
well, keep in mind it's for a grade
But I got it on sale
can't be TOO uhh
i forgot the word im looking for
vulgar?
no not quite
Apathetic?
no
Jewish?
lol
no
Woman?
no
Man?
no
Tactless?
apathetic works
you had to make your answer convey that you don't give a fuck, while making it sound like a valid argument at the same time
yes
lol
got it
I still can't believe that "women's studies" is an actual college corse. Seems like something very un-academic
it's more like I realize they treat people shitty but I also realize my not shopping there won't accomplish anything
Why was this even brought up in that course?
because women in other parts of the world are forced to work shitty factory jobs
waah
Oh no
What's next?
probably gobstoppers
or nerds
Black tribes killing each other with stone spears?
That sure would suck huh
ebola
lol
"Basic sanitation? What's that?"
they probably all saw Bear Grylls drinking his own pee and thought that was a great idea
then they started drinking peebola
wow
thanks tony
More like they threw out the Western powers which controlled their country before they managed to finish building infrastructure and have had 5 consecutive decades of corrupt leadership resulting in countries unable to manage even water distribution
sounds like they're off to a slow start
whabam
I've evolved to ventriloquist puns
lol
i didnt even say a pun though
<<< ?
Sounds like if they had stuck to the Imperialism game plan, they could have ended up like Singapore, Austrialia, or Canada
that isnt a pun
that's a combination of two words
Its a portmanteau
not a pun
thank you ian, at least you understand
You are most welcome
That gif really..... sucks
bah bum tis
that football gif was confusing until i realized its shopped
like
the movement of the dude
who's getting his head hit
no
that's game physics
collision detection with elasticity
the helmet tag is custom, I'm sure
american ski jumping according to Japan
oh god, what is the source of that gif?
i've seen it before
with a bunch of other ones
lol uhhh
orite
someone here posted the video
brandonnnn
wanna go to winco
i went a few hours ago :F
awkward wanna go again
i mean im sure you missed something
lol
i didnt miss anything
Go to Trader Joes
or Whole Foods
closed and far away
Trader Joes is actually pretty cheap
its closed :/
Wait till tomorrow and get good quality never-frozen vegatables?
I get my meat from the butcher at Whole Foods and I only buy whats on sale. But they'll cut you whatever you want, and even grind specific cuts if you ask!
alex just really wanted to go to winco
and I didnt want to lol
i like your skype pic, deco
I do as well
very doctorlike
Thank you, thank you
it took many hours of trying stuff out, but I can now pass through walls on http://cursors.io/
that game was frustrating
ohai
So my parents adopted a turtle :P
aww
what kind
red eared turtle
Red eared slider*
those are fun
are those the ones taht chirp?
Hmm not sure, it wandered into the yard one day and has been there ever since. They've just built him a lil pond.
aww
my sis used to babysit batches of them
not the most graceful of turtles
I've seen photo's of it, looks to be a good size.
I've had dogs, chickens, roosters, bird and frogs but never turtles
simple to take care of
especially if you've had fowl
Yeah I got 5 chickens as a kid and adopted a rooster before then.. and suddenly we had 17+
They were huge aswell
sold a dozen for 3$ as a kid
They were also a fair bit of work, plus they'd start crowing right at my window in the morning :/
The roosters not the chickens :P
lol that would drive me insane
XD
When 1 starts they all start.
You get used to it :P
I'd probably get a cat if i'd have to choose. I like dogs, but cats are less needy
i dislike cats
haha, any particular reason?
my girlfriend had 7, now has 11
NOPE
REVERSE
had 11, now has 7
lots of cats
lots of expulsions
1 cat I can handle
multiple, meh
lol that's a bit extreme xD
1 cat is more than enough
ok kittens are adorable
puppies are adorable
cats are alright
for me, dogs are adorable
also
i'm gonna go see interstellar at some point http://uproxx.com/gammasquad//11/neil-degrasse-tyson-tweets-interstellar/
Sadly both of ours passed away within a week last christmas
oh :<
i'm sorry to hear that
one had cancer and the other, may have died because of the loss
Yeah.. I was here up north :(
aww
....dude
pretty dog
Yeah, he was sweet
On another note, we could start a pet cemetary, with all the pets (including poultry) we've had.
._.
Haha, that movie always freaked me out
Anyway I should sleep. g'night!
lol goodnight
meowoof
that halo menu thing is cool
I miss halo
I miss my xbox :(
sup
nm
i wish i knew the song for the halo 4 menu
?
knew as in knew the words so you could sing along?
lol
btw, nao is on his way home as well
so we should all do some lolligaggin if nobody has stuff to do
lol i'm down
knew as in wish I could identify and find/play/dl/stream
which part? there are actually 3 songs played on the main menu
one of them
the other two aren't on the soundtrack and have no names as released to the public apparently
hi
tony if you dont mind waiting i'll be back in a bit over 2 weeks and we could see interstellar
i can also just see it with my parents though if you wanna see it earlier
also i am up for league
also that cursor game can be frustrating but sometimes it can restore your faith in humanity
a rando cursor will draw "Go!" as he holds a door open for you, well aware of the fact that that means they will get stranded there themselves
lol
also my move through walls thing is so hacky
their code is minified (obfuscation + all white space removed)
and i can only edit it by duplicating it
so i end up with two sessions, one of which is out of sync with the server
so it is SUPER glitchy
basically i just move towards the goal as fast as possible and eventually it detects that i touched it and i move on
i'm down for waiting
and league
and Andrew, I want the voice
that beautiful haunting voice
aha
okkkkkk
league
aka DAMACIAAAAA
or something like that
reunite the freljord for damacia? yeah that's more like it

sup
separation in 53 mins
oh

diffferent pixel densities across different devices is going to kill me

alrighty
lol those are great
my security cam worked! :D
i saw the maintenance guy
lol great
isnt that the most shady looking entrance?
motion tracker?
yeah
also what is he maintaining
it doesnt alwasy record
only when there's motion
ahah
lol he was probably making sure you weren't getting it on
they were SUPPOSED to check the water heater, as well as put stoppers in the sliding door/window
in the dark
but all they did was the stoppers
which I already had
lol
"my job here is done"
lol
wah
its ment's b-day
his birthday is the day after alex's (i'm guessing, time is a weird thing across continents)
so happy b-day ment!

yep lol the email woke me up
thankfully not enough that I couldnt sleep for another three hours

so i looked at what solomid has to say about fighting malzahar as shyvana...
"There's almost nothing you can do here except buy . And even then his lategame damage is absolutely insane. Good luck ulting into this guy's team lategame. I don't care if you're full tank, you will get oneshot."
seems about right
whoa all the other docs are gone o.O
hai ment
and happy belated birthday :)
Hey
Not belated, it's today
and thanks :D
oh right, weirdness with time zones XD
Hmm the other docs are still there for me.
they were showing as offline and then simultaneously appeared as busy
*shrugs*
yeah suddenly most of my contacts show as away, I think they may have made a few changes to skype
inded
deed*
HAPPY BIRTHDAY MENT
Thanks

fact or fiction http://i.imgur.com/R6Zi7dp.jpg
now I want a cake made with this :/
i've only ever had nutella on crapes, but it was pretty good
Ah yeah, good on almost anything :p
so last night i tried dipping an olive garden breadstick in an italian margarita
it tasted weird
lol
who even thinks of doing that
me
like really
lol
the lunch table in 6th grade was an interesting place
Well brother used to dip fries in coke
there were many challenges put forth
coca cola*
lol
lol
fries and cocaine, guess that'd be like using sugar rather than salt
xD
what was that about Brandon eating like a stoner
stoners dont eat margarita bread sticks
they would try it
that's like hunger games fancy people level of gormet
you'd blow them away though
guaranteed
Who knows it could have been a culinary hit :P
lol
lol
i was hoping you meant margherita
like the pizza
which reminds me
Brandon and I went to an arcade once and ordered a "4-Cheeses Pizza" (it's how they put it on their menu).
The lady thought we ordered a "For Jesus Pizza"
lol
haha
was that the time we spilled the drink everywhere?
yes
lol
good times
lol
they brought a pitcher out instead of glasses
i think it was that day or another where we ran UP the DOWN escalator and were being cheered on by people who wasn't his parents
didn't dare look over whilst doing that lol
lol
that was another day i believe
roit
same place though
man I loved that fire fighter game, even though every time i played it it was exactly the same
and i never really progressed very far
the hoses were just so cool

You guys can go without me

Reno also smells weird
just the areas infested with homeless people
there's too much wind for the whole city to develop a distinct smell
sounds like calgary
[9:19:49 PM] Brandon Worl: just the areas infested with homeless people
So everywhere? but up on the mountain
and by the lake
except less cold
lol

is there anything else actally worthwhile beyond that? :P
ermahgerd
[9:40:10 PM] Ian: She wants to sit on a barrel cactus for the true desert expierience
[9:40:22 PM] Courtney Boyle: is there anything else actally worthwhile beyond that? :P
Seee?
I know theres a lake with an underwater ancient native american city
She wants to sit on a cactus

brandone
arrow?
o hai

lol he must want to not see me
my guess is he just doesn't like Ricardos
psssh
He never likes ricardos
He's never here
brandon was
i saw him
hi
andross is in cali this weekend
so he probably wont be here at all
ahah
it really bothers me when people spam new lines instead of using page breaks in text documents
or if blank lines have formatting
or if there's useless spaces after a sentence
none of which are visible, but it still bothers me
Does  it now ?
lol
people refer to me as "Super Dude" on that cursor game now
i saw a guy helping other cursors get through so i gave him my hax
now there's two of us helping people :D
lol great
there was one guy who didnt like my hax
he said "GTFO"
so i teleported to the exit and left him stuck there
lol
wtf its 1 am? o_O
i'm just sitting here eating a pot pie thinkings it's like 10 pm
i forget that that's an idea emoticon
ah yeah
lol
I:
better?
indeed
i don't know what to say i'm just declaring my presence in case shit's going down
Haven't heard anything all day, so far it's been pretty quiet
yeah weekends are strange
Indeed, sundays
It's been raining here all day so, i've been mostly stuck inside hanging out.
it's....hm
cold here
"cold"
10.5c
i shoulnd't be complaining lol
lol I'd agree on that xD
for me that'd be cold aswell, it's probably 8 or 9C
still, raining over there
probably much colder
stopped raining but very much still wet. 9.5C on the thermometer :P
outside of course
Inside it's a wonderful 21C
The humidity is suffering for it though, at 41%
lol
oh yeah ouch
Not much you can do about it besides drying laundry near the radiator :P
I:
Up to much?
hai
just got home
holy shit those birds
what a badass
birds?
aye thar be birds
Was hoping for something of a bit more mass.
Like seagulls and pidgeons
lol
guys
i got lollipop.. for my tablet now too!
lol
woo
So I started watching/rewatching SG1 from the beginning
For being from 1997, it really hides its age well
except for the 3 inch thick laptops
and that floppy disk
lol
i grow stronger daily! I can now push all buttons on Cursors.io instancly simply by pushing a key on my keyboard
You are a wizard sir
lol
they call me...
super dude
....good god
super dude, guy, man?
it's so funny seeing them react
i show up and suddenly a super dark circle appears on the top left corner of every button
they all draw "o.o"
some asshole left me stuck in a box after I helped him through like 10 levels though
so now i am super dude contained in a super box of no escape
lol
i'm stuck
i don't get how people are doing that smooth vertical/horizontal scale
lemme help you out
sec
here''s how to use
ctrl shift j
paste that all in console
enjoy
oh also
to avoid bugginess refresh before pasting it
did it work?
it did
that's the wallhack right?
what level are you on?
and super click
how can i tell?
the level? describe it
gold?
lol
argh mom skyping
sec
k sorry lol
no worries
now what level?
with the pink square
theres a few like that
is it the pink square and 4 buttons?
yeah
the one when my mom called
ok
just press space or something
while in thesquare!
you must stay in that square
or you'll get stuck
yeah got stuck
lol
sec
god people are stupid
they wont let me pass
to save you
lol
lol this is so buggy
movement wise? or is the map messed up?
movement is a little jumpy but that should be the only issue
yeah i keep bouncing
FRAK
well im here
i instantly teleported out of the square
lol i got through
ffff
lost connection
lol
im not far ahead on my other window
i think we can do this
can you mumble? lol
yeah lol
lol you really mumbled for the click game
gg
we are super heroes
uh huh
lol
you should see my power!
they call me a god!
lol watch the devs of that game IP ban you or something
I have the biggest, blackest click!
lol
if they ip ban me, that's what proxies are for
such a haxor nao jeez no wonder you have name stealers
actually that is the biggest blackest click
seriously
we could identify each other from the size of our clicks
lol they were superclicks because you clicked tons of times per click?
50x as many click packets per click
damn
yayyyy'
i beat it again
and i got a ton of people through with me
-_
-
do we need to mumble and get that fucking thing
i wanna win it :<
lol
are enough people playing?
im fixing a bug in my hax
123 people online
i figured out why buttons were glitching out
just not how to fix it
bummer
ok so do you think i can solo that?
i did
if not i can try to catch up and help
i may have fixed it actually
THEY ADDED THE SMILE UNDERNEATH ITS A PHONYYYY

the one that won
it just loaded a bonus level?
that was weird
it loaded a random old level
anyways you stuck?
yeah
yeah i accidentally went all the way through lol
its an early level
shouldnt be stuck long
T_T
i had a herd
an entire herd
they left me
i opened all doors and they left me
you through now or not yet? i got another window there
no
i'm at the one that looks liek a person
with the buttons and spaces
I GOT LEFT BEHIND AGAIN BY ANOTHER HACKER
I WAS TRYING TO HELP HIM THROUGH
GAH
IM GONNA BE SELFISH
where?
thankfully people have been coming in hordes
no dont join the dark side
What did you do this for brandon
they are stupid, it isnt their fault
the top/bottom spiral
@ian ?
lol int
too much programming
oh
i was clicking to try to see if you were there
didnt see you respond
...that was you
T_T
i made it through
but then...i wasn't fast enough past the door?
i'm trapped here
do i take top or bot?
don't know
obv you go mid, you're an ap carry jeez noob
got myself stuck
lol
where are you?
nvm im good
but still where are you?
tesellated
again
stopped to help people
got boned
ok stuck where w e were
not sure if im ahead or behind
lemme know if you see a big black click
nope
got farther
 now i'm stuck
on the right side
actually need people to click the left buttons
waiting for next group
passede
lol hi bran
hi
careful with the click all
if you spam it it can cause you to lose connection
lol
with the version you have, at least
lol you improved it?
yeah i'm stuck now
me too
should've gone with that crowd charing
this part is hard
lol
it's near the end though
be free!
see this is why i don't help people lol
i wasnt trying to
i derped up that one
lol
figured i'd go down with honor as a hero
is that you? on an earlier level?
or another haxor?
lol um
no
i'm at curiosity
he has blg black click
OH
DO NOT BE CURIOUS\
DO NOT
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD
DO NOT
JUST TAKE THE EASY WAY
IF YOU ARE CURIOUS YOU GO BACK TO LEVEL 1!
SERIOUSLY?!?!?
yes
lol i just hacked like 10 people into there
gg
im unstuck now
omw
lol celebratory clicking
shall we go on to victory?
lol they still won
yeah
lol that was amusing
isnt it fun being a god?
also i didnt fix the bug apparently
wait wat
yes i did so why do i keep getting errors >_<
Its so nice not having skype ads
yep
y u no have ads?
you can block ads in skype
^
Is Ian intimidating in real life?
i still see ads
You can block any ad from any URL
i removed the microsoft ads
he says his friends say he is
how are you people wizards
we google
he's not intimidating
^
Thanks
I'm really not
lol
we consult the great wizard Googlicus zul zorrander
Some people I think are just chickens
and are scared of polite language
it was fun being a god
Ian isn't intimidating
he may knowledge you
^ +2
but not intimidating
knowledge me?
o.o
It means to hit you with a book so hard you die
oh
my math teacher did that once
you already do that to me
pardon?
I must have an extremely long arm
So pro
wow
hahaha
ow
welp, I have clearly invested too much time in to this, but my super click all buttons thing works reliably and correctly now
well Razz my berries
i just learned a new slang term!
nao
hey nao
nao
lol
wow
god that whole "dirty energy" thing
it is so stupid
lol yeah
glad you knew who that was
don't show your mom the evolution
of course
lol
the worst part is my mom tries to push all that dirty energy nonsense on to me
yeah
if they could clarify what "dirty" energy was then yeah I'd be down
well "dirty" is a buzz word
and they have basically zero conclusive evidence to support it
and it is just "bad" for you
and makes you "feel" tired
basically anything that produces any form of radiation, they instantly assume is bad
its kinda like being amish, without quite being amish
lol
ahah
ok
Andrew, I picked up your programming languages homework for you
lol oh shit
Cursors.io changes the passive field
on level 2
the correct goal changes
this bitch
spiral gate
where near the gate you can get through
dude stopped right in front o fit
waited
blew through and didn't trip gates
screw it
back to hacking
lol
yeah, it can be frustrating without hax
i have a few ideas for "because I can" hax to add
passive "aura" mode where it constantly draws some sort of shape/pattern around the cursor
and the ability to draw perfect text
lol
lol
just came across a cursor that is able to draw perfect smiley faces
via a macro or JS lke I'm doing it
i drew a perfect circle and he drew a face in it
aaaand then he drew a swastika
lol god
wow so uhh... aura mode + reset zone = crash
in a very strange fashion
...huh
lol
so aura mode might not be a good idea
just because of the way drawing works in this game
heh
i can still implement drawing pictures and text though
what's a good image i could draw? that can be drawn with simple lines black/white
i could draw GabeN and then put it on PCMR for karma
oh thank you brandoon
what did I get?
lol
cool beans. that was teh one where we skipped the ec right?
yeah
not bad then
you lost 5 points for not actually writing the functions in the last one
interesting? lol
i don't remember it at all
it was something about the function being broken and you had to fix it
oh
lame
I said what needed fixing
:F
it was literally two lines
the question said to rewrite the function though
ah
which is actually less writing than the paragraph you had anyways
lol
lol
gg me
also we started prolog last class
damn
i was so tired though
lol
wouldnt have absorbed anything
lol
prolog is weird
doesnt seem hard though
online tutorials ftw
you fellas up for a game or two of league? I have til like 8
im working on more cursors magic
break = takeplz :F
...maybe
i dont want to play league atm
lol
laaame :P
i just got shamed out
honestly
like
ARAM
peepz just raped you? lol
atrociously
and i should've known better
gotcha
meh, it happens
I get wrecked by bots all the time
lol
the people i play with yell at me though
so it becomes unfun
yeah i've heard stories :F
praise be to gaben
it is starting to work
lmao fixed the random gaps in the image
this is hilarious
what is that game?
cursors.io
roght
but its point
what do you do
cooperate with other cursors to beat levels
lol
Is this the one you cheat at?
yes
lol how complex is your cheat?
based on what?
the code itself is pretty simple
most complex part is the whole drawing images thing
Hmm
because I had to write an image parser to encode the data in to something i can send their server
also over half your tabs are javascript
lol
lol
i closed a bunch already
xD
oh my god dude lol
let me know when you get a full image
scrn plz
i have it
trying to get to a big enough level to draw it
where there will also be people
dafuq
i cant printscreen
ya dun goofed son
your script has become self aware
and will now take your computer
did you just
break me out of the server
that was u
i saw the click density
?
dont think so
i keep my click count low
fraking jerks left me behind
what level you on? lemme gaben you
lol
you need to swastika
post that to pcmr plz
already did
lol
i can make it draw any black/white image, too
i just run the image through my parser and paste the array in to the program
hmm my email/full name is visible in my tabs
also my school
deleted all ready?
deleted and reuploaded
lol
with info cropped
i just saw someone who could draw text
they drew text to a pastebin
must one-up
lol
wooo i can draw letters now
a-z upper case
oh great
now you need to be able to start "text mode" where you just type what you want in the console and it writes it for you
already working on it
inb4 "hello chaps, this is your lord and savior. please follow my big black click!"
lol click
dat hand encoded font
lol
dang
lol looks good
nice
my inner architect approves
lol
still have to manually specify coordinates for the word to appear at
i might add a text box and a cursor lock toggle
so you just type in the text box, lock at position, then send
although i cant easily add a text box so that may be a problem
lol
i can type a message then hit enter now
no way to backspace but whatevs
i can use backspace now and the current message shows under the canvas :D
welp, i drew mona lisa
now i just need to draw a recursive tree and i'll be back to where I was half a decade ago
lol
lol god
a game where hacking the client is an intended feature would be cool
write your own magic spells that way or something
lol where the hell did that fruit face cutout come from
wasn't it after a trip or something?!
I got my face in the hole, that counts!
[5:50:57 AM] Anthony Humphreys: I got my face in the hole, that counts!
No context
lol
oh
lol
uhhh
I was told I failed I:
lol
apparently there's a boss way to stick your head through a hole
so, my senior project is like 1-2 weeks away from being functionally complete :D
and we still have until may next semester to finish it
nice
tut tut
@Mez http://imgur.com/gallery/H8SjjeN
lol
oh god
lol we've all been there :P
My question is
How does the train have current to travel?
The track is not complete so there is no complete circut
asking the real questions involving claymation hounds
It runs on fear
lol
it runs on time
B)
it had inertia from going down the stairs initially
(seen it)
Oh
Must have been a long stairwell
oyeah
fo free
Insurgency
that link can be used 3 times
1st come 1st serve
got it :D thanks
cool
np
wow, gauntlet is only ten bucks on humble store right now
...hm
hi
andrew
tacos and PL homework?
indeed sir
quien?
well i am starving
lol
eat something :P
im all out of food
come have some kind of food? lol
i have chips but no dip
alex wants tacos too :P
i have salsa
is alex at work?
yep
til 10
lemme know if youre gonna head over
got my headphones on
lol
im feeding my cursors god complex addiction :F
lol oh dear
welp
there was like 20 of them with me
i went in the box to make the maze disappear
all of them abandoned me
I SHALL SMITE THEM
as soon as someone takes pity on me and releases me
cant release yourself as god of cursors?
watch volume
someone released me
justice was served
and no, God isn't all powerful
for it is written, in the book of Architectur, verse 13:37 that collision detection shall be performed on the server side
lol
i ought to release my cheats, but actually release a bit of code that blue screens you if you are an asshole to others instead
lol oh god
seriously
i went back to rescue this guy
and he BOOKED IT
closed the door behind him too
anyways android, I decided to make a salad, since my lettuce is gonna go bad soon
it's a lettuce, pepperoni, and cheddar cheese salad
with a vidalia onion dressing
because thats all of the ingredients i had
lol
doesnt sound horrible actually
we'll see
yeah, not half bad
you can use an icicile in BF4
that's cool
let me know when you want to work on that homework. I have to finish my group game tonight so i'm pretty busy otherwise
i'm looking over it right now
we should just do these separately and compare answers
because this is requiring a lot of googling
lol
yeah i tried googling earlier, couldnt find a whole lot
i have 1 and 2 so far
on 4 c i can only think of one ambiguous issue
i'm not even past number two
lol
btw, number one is yes, right? you can do factorials the iterative way inside a macro using a for loop
the answer is yes, kinda
because you can't really just tell it how many times to loop in a macro
for(i = 1, j = 2; j <= n;; j++){
i *= i;
i isnt declared
nor is j
or n
i dont think you can declare them in a macro, either
hence the kinda
the macro is FAC(n)
wut
lol
the macro depends on those variables existing
that's a ( /n/ )
i know
ok
the macro doesn't guarantee n exists though
or any of those other variables
so a macro alone isn't quite enough
int i,j,n; n=10; FAC( n ); would work
riiiight
yes
just thought about that
lol
for 2a, it seems to retain its value because the function got combined into the same activation frame and never deleted the data for y (or something like that), yeah?
no
whelp
it deallocates between calls
this guy is wrong then
lol
it just happens to reallocate to the same location on the 2nd call
that's what I though originally, before I googled it
lol
what would be the case where it doesnt happen? if you had a variable or some memory allocation between the two calls to p?
yes, i think it has to take place in a fuction though
like p()z()p()
why in a function? so it takes a space in some local-variable-memory?
(pretty sure that's not a thing but you know)
it'd have to be put on the stack
probably because of something along the lines of different stacks in different memory locations
anything declared in main won't have the same memory location as something declared in a function called from main
right
welp, i finished. my #4 might have errors though
nice
i think the two sources of ambiguity i mentioned on 4 c might actually be the same thing
i'm stuck on number 3, completely
pass by value is easy
well with that you couldn't do it to elements of the array
with value?
yeah
cause it's not referenced
would pass by value work on int a = 1; int b = 2; swap(a,b); ?
no
lol
and those arent arrays
unless your parameter was (int& x, int& y)
then that would be by reference
right
so, see why value doesn't work? :p
reference is the same as passing by name, duh
jeez kid
no it isnt
because it works if you pass by reference
(i know, but I was thinking that)
lol
so
to recap
a) only works if you pass by reference
no
a doesnt work
because it says you are passing by value
but you can pass a value by reference
if you pass by reference then that is a totally different scenario
no you cant
if you do that you are passing by reference
which is entirely different than passing by value
lol
okok
so with passing by NAME you wouldnt be able to do it if argB depended on argA, like if you passed (a, a+3) or something like that
no, because a+3 isnt a name
the important hint in 3 is that it has to work for simple variables and variables indexed by an array
so if you did swap(x, y[x]) it wouldnt work
correct
does it have to be x and y[x] or could it be x and y[z]
it has to be x and y[x]
ok
otherwise there's no mutual dependence
riiiight
just clciked
good god
whelp
gg
no saving it now
lol
edit fail
*2
wtf is value-result
lol
it is passed by value and then the result is saved back in to the original variables
aha
makes sense if you look at the name
you do the e.c.?
yeah
pretty sure the answer is no, because the compiler needs to figure out the optional stuff anyway and if you provide them it would make it faster
the answer is no, but for a different reason, unless i am misunderstanding you
subroutines with optional parameters are implemented exactly the same as subroutines with explicit parameters
they are just set to the default values
so its no slower and no faster either way
it's exactly the same as ones without optional params, so yeah
gotcha
lmfao Guude's sims series is hilarious
never watched it
he's cheating on his wife, and the wife just unexpectedly came home from work while the other woman was in the house
his scream was hilarious
and he scrambled to send Guude off to work and get his son to tell the other woman to leave before the wife noticed
haha
with 4c is it going to try and write the first argument back into A[1] rather than A[0] since i got increased?
that's one of the ambiguities
if it recordes the return address at the beginning or end of the function call
the other ambiguity would be which value is stored
no
they're the same
i said the other ambiguity is the order they are returned in
i feel like i may be wrong on that though
because the more i think about that the less sense it makes
well it wouldnt matter in this case right? they're the same values
oh, i guess it would because they are the same
say the 2 variables x and y arent the same
x = 1 and y = 2
if it writes x first and y second, then a[i] will be 2
if its the other way a[i] will be 1
right
but in this case they're still both 1
no
no
a[0] is 0
a[1] is 1
twice
uhh
a[0] is 1 and a[1] is 2
or vice versa
oh
right
depending on if it does it at the beginning or end
they start at 1
lol
whelp
that's probably good enough
thanks for being the idea bounce wall with added force coming back in my direction
lol
speaking of fast things, flash is tonight
alex got a new 40in tv for her birthday but its in our room
wait
nvm
i have a game to finish
fuck
:F
ll
lol
basically gonna eat and work :( such a lame night
how much do you have left on your game?
well
we had basic player mechanics done
and lots of spriting and backgrounds and stuff done by me
and one enemy done (we need three) and we need 12 levels, three of which need unique boss mechanics that involve both players
we also would very much like to have a count-up timer and high score thingy
according to my groupmembers we now have 4 levels including one boss done, the last two normal enemies are done, and the second set of 4 levels is being worked on
so i'll have to do 4 levels including a boss, as well as fix everything they half-ass, and then i'll have to add the timer and high score if I feel awake enough at 3am
well timer and high score should be easy
kind of
high score is going to need a bit of work because we can't just use the built in one for our level system
iirc writing a time/name pair to a file is easy with GM though
so you could do that
and just make a level that displays that
that would probably work
icicles are legit
ready for teh tacoez?
yep
oquay
head on over, i'll unlock the door
still no blithering size
?
lol
just complaining that's all
hello
hi
i can tell this powerpoint is old because it shows a blackberry as a popular smartphone
khehehhehe blackberry xD
well Razz my berries! A good ol' cellular phone!
yo brando, you okay with doing arrow and flash tomorrow night? alex has a test tomorrow and needs to study
sure
cool beanz
i'll watch The 100/ more SG1
lol
how are your godhax going?
Lets just say that if I could, I would make a great flood that wiped out all of cursormanity
lol
y u no
just break the rules
the bible may say that collision is server side, but that didnt stop scientists from making particle accelerators!
particle accelerators dont break the laws of physics
um have you seen flash? yes they did
nope
big league patch
i saw the video thingy for the new champ
kallista?
she looks fun
such doctor
lo
well done
lol nice
kallista's ult looks awesome
looks like the doctor's farm has a hole in it
wow
that video about the creepers just taught me what peat is and why it's a thing that creates fuel in FTB
lol
You didn't know what peat is?
lol
i knew what it was, but only at a basic level. I now know much, much more lol
lol
oh god ii just about flipped my shit
so www.pointerpointer.com
it points to your cursor
it's a fun little time waster
and
this came up
For a minute there I thought that was me
that would be hilarious
i wonder how that works
database of pictures linked to a vector that represents the direction the finger is pointing in, get position of cursor on page, draw line from vectors in db to cursor, when done finding matches display picture that is closest to the cursor
it'd be a lot simpler to just divide the area into a grid and match images to each order pair
but either way, i'd expect it to be a lot faster than it is if that's what it did
yeah it does seem to take a while
maybe it doesnt have the images preloaded and that's what takes longer?
loading images from a db is fast
they may have a huge database and tons of selections of pictures. if you make it big enough no matter the method it'd be slow
not necessarily
there are databases designed for huge amounts of data that have order n lookup
true, but with a lookup like this one you could have several thousand possible images with pointers that match the cursor. you then have to pick the prettiest looking people, which requires machine learning as well as fuzzy logic
bam
lol brb getting alex
i think they're probably using some sort of CV to figure out programatically where the finger is pointing
and that's just what's slow
or maybe they just slowed it down on purpose
to preserve bandwitch
loading so many images in real time to track the cursor would take a lot of bandwidth
i think i found a way to manipulate time on cursors
mez, care to join for an aram?
sorry, had a lot of teamgames :<
and 5:30 am is gonna wreck me for it lol
nite
my team members for my game project, literally as soon as we were done with making the game, started talking about League and how they both mainly play aram lol
dude league players are like the illuminati
fucking everywhere
i put it off for like years until I realized it wasn't gonna die lol
lol
mentos, battle id is DarkWingAP#1823
dunnit
it's true, everyone plays League
it's weird
I just got a severe beating :(
call 911
lol
it wasn't THAT bad
you should see my NA decks :P
lol, i'll see about getting an NA account an have a look
my AI teacher cancelled class today because he wants to play with his new robot instead
lol
right now my eyes are over stimulated
haha wow
apparently we just got a new half-million dollar robot in the robotics lab
wow
wtf does it do? cook you breakfast and reply when you call it jeeves?
it can fetch a beer
it can cook too if you program it to
and probably reply when you call it jeeves
whelp, its official
I want one
start saving
lol
no need
the school has one
or plan an elaborate heist
^
i'll club richard over the head, you grab the robot
haha
sounds good
we'll need to disable any security cameras along the way though
or just wear masks
i am all out of ritz crackers and chewy bars
sadface
oh wait i have 7 ritz in my backpack
if i eat those and then finish my test quickly, i shouldnt starve to death
lol
hey mentos
here are my NA decks
so I gave my cheats out to someone, and this morning they contacted me on Reddit and called me "Cursor God"
lol
rofl
just hit rank 10 on NA in hearthstone :P
this month has been really tough to climb ranks
thx
I think i've been overthinking this game
definitely a possibility
<-- this could possibly help AI get better at object recognition
It's good to know the cards you have in a deck
yep, very good
lol ment, we looked at that article in my AI class
also the PR2 robot is really impressive looking
it's almost as tall as I am
o.o
and its head looks freakishly scifi
and i bet it could rip my arms off if it wanted to
it gets taller
that's legit
costs like 400-500k
lol
thanks hearthstone
discard a card at the beginning, get the same one again
m31, its even better when you discard all 3/4 cards and they come back exactly the same cards in a different order
heh
nao that's legit lol
we just made this
it is good
that is super white
like
wow
hey man
that looks like a mess
you are super white
This is true
its actually not that bad
but my food taste is super not white
mess wise
lol
yeah
but its delicious
and kind of stoner food if someone else made it
so it fits brandon's food palate
Best "stoner" food is in'n'out at like 01:00 in the morning
nope, definitely dennys at 3am
or taco bell's dorito tacos
but in'n'out actually tastes good
Dennys and Taco Bell are gross
I:
you don't go to dennys
you end up at dennys
no we often decide specifically to  go to dennys because of coupons
Is it ever your first choice?
yeah
Do you know of other good breakfast foods/restaurants?
yeah but not that are open til... forever
so due to time constraints?
no
we go to dennys during normal dinner hours
we go for the cheap food
you actively are in the mood for a hot plate of Denny's because you enjoy their food sober?
because coupons
if coupons weren't a thing?
then we probably wouldnt go there
cheap and open forever
but if ricardos was 100 dollars a plate we wouldnt go there either
true
i'm still saying you end up at dennys
at least
i end up at denny's
i never actively want to have dennys
ever
it's the arby's of breakfast foods
they do one think REALLY GOOD
all else :x
Ricardos is open 24/7
dennys master race
i forget you people blend toquitos
^
ew
yum
thoughts?
oh good god
that looks....oh good god
still in alpha
that looks really cool actually
wtb multiplayer
so bad
what's endgame?
you have to make rocket defense systems to land an earth colony ship on the planet
but so much automation
oh wow
yeah been watching some youtube factorio series
looks really cool
any1 wan2 l3ague?
sure
actually
getting kinda late for me :(
lol
i'm just gonna head into a bot game anyway
getting up at 4:30 ftl
ouch

deforestation in factorio is so much nicer with a flamethrower
lol
factorio good?
Apparently they have a few on patrol in silicon valley
not bad at all
Yeah it's nice
Takes a while to get the assembly line setup efficiently
my base is a giant convoluted mess though
It is quite the puzzle
and thank goodness for peaceful mode
haha, was about to ask how you kept everything safe and stocked
I set the game to never attack first
finally found my first biter base way the hell away
thats that i did
ah good man
my big problem is going to be when i run out of iron
i have a huuuuuuuuuuuge iron field, but it's kinda a long way away
and i have no idea how trains work
meow
you guys have the demo or buy the alpha?
torrent
thinking about buying it
aha
I haven't tried trains yet
if they plan on multiplayer, i will instabuy
I've only used conveyors thus far. Aut I built relatively close to the ores
Same, it's a good time filler :p
unfortunately, i only started out with a relatively small iron patch
I didn't think they ran out :x
yup
lol
sadly, time for me to get ready for work
And time for me to sleep :P
g'night (wave)
Factorio?
How complex is it
looks pretty complex
mmmmmm
Like OpenTTD levels?
of complex
doubtful
that would be cool though
android, do you need to go to winco?
after much consideration I have decided that I will in fact go to winco with you
if you'd like we could do it after I pick up alex, we're gonna grab in-n-out after as well
that way its all one trip
sure
bool ceans
woo i added marker mode to cursor jesus
nice
yeah
i ended up not doing it with vectors
i tried and it looked wonly
when you made sharp angles
wonky*
interesting
how'd you do it?
now i just draw 5 points in a + shape
aha
same effect basically
yeah
imma play some league, anyone care to join?

o_O
hi
o_O
I see the russian maffia using something like this
"Play if you want to live"
or hackers making random people drop dead
lol or that
May aswell, just play the game and tally after how much blood you'll have to give
dafuq
lol sand wall
aww we do have to do a paper submission as well brandon

yes
it got better
juith
i love the spit blobs
lol yeah
the detail is glorious
lol
gonna save that for a rainy day
that recursive tree is pretty nifty
i like how it uses a circle for thickness
hmm?
tony messaged it to me and i was too lazy to switch back to that chat to reply directly to him
lol
<<< 
yuck
it uses flash
lol
pretty cool though
it makes some pretty realistic looking trees
so then
shall we prolog?
yeah, i've been browsing a tutorial so i have a basic understanding
want to skype/mumble?
indeed sir
lets do mumble
ok
lol why is that such a huge deal
extremism
So
you're saying black people are like al queda?
nope
That's what I got from it
So we'll start the drone strikes tomorrow
maybe i misunderstood what you were asking about
That case result reddit comment page you linked
oh, curiosity
in case anyone wanted to watch history being made
Wait, a small town court case is now history?
lol
I think it will likely be forgotten by march or something
Just like this story overwrote George Zimmerman
what happened, ian wont tell me what happened, why are there riots?
I did explain
lol
A black kid got shot
people were grumpy
No I dont even know what happened, what the case was about? why people are unhappy
basically
White police officer
Because black people say it was racial profiling
black unarmed civilian
classic case
but then various interest groups got involved
Honestly it just police shooting people again
and things escalated on both sides
police brought in military vehicles
people started freaking out
it became a heated issue of race and civil rights
but to the extremes
police officer wasn't indicted (decided as of tonight)
well i mean...military vehicles yp
so of course people went to the streets
now there's riots
etc. etc.
Our cops dont shoot people...they just do starlight tours :(
caused a lot of people to have a bit of national introspection
violence rarely leads to positive changes
yeah
this is actually one of the more peaceful riots
people are actively blocking looters
thats good
but military vehicles?
er...where is it
that hardly seems necessary? is that even legal? like on citizens?
MRAP
were they actually military vehicles?
like operated by the us military?
Yes
no
wait were they?
Well previously
operated by military?
They are surpluss
ok so operated by police
so basically just big vehicles to intimidate rioters, and provide protection to police
it's not like a tank or a humvee with a 50 cal mounted on the back
yeah no
lol
where did andrew disappear to?
just mine resistant
objectively it's a sick vehicle
kinda sketch to be on civ streets though
rioters are also sketch on civ streets
true
mob mentality scares me
yeah
we saw how that turned out for the piggies
the pequenos
wat
the french
ender's game reference
lol oh
wait
no
a later book in the series, though
Lord of the flies
oh
ahah
you said piggy
also LotF
lol
piggy, yes
of course the streams have editorialized commentary
piggies
Boulders
andrew totally just disappeared in the middle of working on HW on mumble
._.
alex involved?
either that or ninjas
damn ninjas
lol uhhh
one of the streamers' phone/camera got stolen
lol
it was fucking recording
LOL
It seems to me people were just looking for an excuse to loot
variety of reasons
made me laugh out loud though
2:30
lol
GG phone
that sucks
'We call it "Pizzabomination". Ground beef, cheddar cheese and bacon sandwiched between two DiGiorno pizzas.'
oh my god
why am i so hungry now
because you want pizzabomination
not just some
I want one
for myself
right meow
bring me a pizzbomination
FETCH ME A SHRUBBERY
all i can offer you is pasta salad
ew no
als
also
uhhh
tell me you didn't make that
HOW IS THAT EW?!?!?!
YOU MAKE NO SENSE!
YOU EAT LIKE A STONER BRO
SO?!
WE HAVE DIFFERENT TASTES
IT LOOKS AMAZING
DO YOU LIKE CHEESE BURGERS?!
DO YOU LIKE PIZZA?
DO YOU LIKE BACON?
I LIKE CHEESE BURGERS WITH PIZZA AS THE BUN
FETCH ME ONE PEASANT
BUTT SCRATCHA!
the hell is wrong with you folks
ian isnt cool like us
BUTT SCRATCHAAAA!!!
butt scratcherrrr :(((((
Ian AND Tony
You guys seriously find the most disgusting food items ever
they just don't understand
lol
HOW IS THAT DISGUSTING
i'm sure on a drunken night that would be delicious
HOW
but that just doesn't look...appealling to me
dude I used to not eat jello because it jiggled
I cooked yesterday
IT LOOKS LIKE A MESS OF DELICIOUSNESS
in my french oven
I COOKED PIZZA YESTERDAY
ON MY FRENCH BREAD
I cooked a french yesterday in my pizza oven
I made a rice dish, I made a broth with beef tips, black beans, bay leaves, cilantro, green onion, lime, and carrots; let it simmer for 2 hours, then added the rice.
It was good
I made taco bread that was similar to that
i made taco salad
That sounds nothing like that
lol
but all of that was inside a crescent roll bun thingy
literally all of that minus the broth, bay leaves, and carrots were in my dish
black beans?
refried black beans, yes
eww
from a delicious sounding can
schlerrrrp
scuuuu
plop
Clearly we need some schwip schwop
clearly
if not, then spezzi
^
Brandon knows
why not just pizzbomination
it has two z's as well
i vote for pizzabomination
me3
god that looks so good
seriously
I looks like a once frozen heartattack
aka american food
When I make american classics nothing I use is frozen
so make a pizzbomination minus two digornio and plus two hand-crafted pizza
modern american classic, never frozen ingredients, ???, profit
that's how that works right?
well
if I were to make a "cheeseburger" pizza
nonono
cheeseburger with pizza bun
a full pizza
on each side
why not a cheeseburger calzone then?
no other thing will suffice to be called a pizzbomination
because then it isnt a cheese burger with pizza buns
then you're just imitating a classic in another less awesome form
So just make a calzone then?
I made a really good buffalo chicken calzone a couple weeks ago
like making apple pie in the shape of little cupcakes
it's just not apple pie then
I'm a huge fan of calzones
but you can't make a cheeseburger calzone and call it a pizzbomination
lol
they could even have the exact same ingredients, still no pizzbomination
calzones are good
^
they really are
they're my favorite thing to get at whatever italian restaurant I happen to be at
oh boy
another youtube fan found me on the GH forums
hehehe
lol
also strombolis
also good god
also
the first page is all about the riots lol
at first I was super confused because it said I was looking at some kind of naruto sasuke fanfix
then I looked at the URL and it made sense
what?
your link
imgoingtohellforthis
when you go to the page it says it is /r/narutoxsasukefanfics
uhh
wat
lol
yeah
lol
i dont want to go to my remaining classes :(
then dont :P
i have a presentation to do for my 2:30 class
they don't need you, they have like 12 slides all to themselves
plenty of material
well i mean if i want a grade i kinda have to go
nahh I don't think that's how it works
ok that's fucking hilarious
i didn't even know that
also
Ferguson (and probably the rest of St. Louis) is going to wind up like Detroit after the black roits in the 70's
The whites who own all the industries are going to leave
and there will be no jobs
boom
instant Detroit
hi
hi
andrew are we doing taco 2'sday?
perhaps I too will have tacos

i'm here
Velcome herr doktor.
Wie ghets
if i said that right
gut :P
I dunno, never had german
lol
In highschool we got french and spanish
I think formal it's Wie ghet es einen
but wie ghets for informal
oh nice
i'm....kinda sorta ish learning spanish
The grammar is a pain
But it's easier than most
I've tried mandarin, but after skipping to the last lesson, I saw that this wasn't going to happen.
lol ahah yeah
Tried russian aswell, just because. But didn't have the time to spend on it and uni.
I just want to learn spanish because that's like...language #2 in the US
I also want to be able to know what people are saying at my work if they curse me out
xD
learn the swear words :P
Shouldn't be too difficult, there are plenty of helpful guides for spanish i'm sure
well ihave Rosetta STone
it's jsut a mattero fme actualy taking the time to learn it lol
Yo tengo come sandwiches y beben agua.
"I eat sandwiches and drink water."
lol Rosetta stone is pretty good. I used it to get me started on russian
Muy bien
has changed a bit since i've used it but I remember it being real easy.
that's kinda cool
Wie ghets
if i said that right
<<<  should be wie gehts
ahah
thank ye
reddit is the worst and the best thing I swear
My sister had never seen office space before
so I made her watch it
lol
it's a trip
Its a great movie
it prepares you for real life
yehhhhhh
Tony, I'm... uhhhh gonna have to ask you to come in on Saturday
Okay?.... Thaannnks
Yeah if you could just go ahead...
god
yes, that is work
that is 100% work at its worst
^
Pretty much
never seen office space
you should watch it
yes
i want to learn to play this: http://www.scribd.com/doc/171946134/Nightwish-Ghost-Love-Score
Its pretty repetitive
you could learn pretty quick
it's a long song
i'm also very out of practice
Its still not very difficult, even out of practive maybe 20-30 hours would get it up to playable
yeah
So do it?
It's still harder than any other songs I've learned lol
Still, its not the Warsaw concerto or anything
yeah
I'd have to somehow get my keyboard to reno
Open a worm hole
I'll need to build a stargate first
Do that first then?
maybe I know someone who's going to be driving back
There you go!
a wormhole would be cooler though
This is true
it'd probably make me a billionaire
I'd have to sue you
it was my idea
but it was in stargate already
unless you'll give me 10%
i'll give you 10% if you throw your soul in to the deal
i'll even make it 12%
lol would you take 20 other souls?
hmmmm nah most of them arent that noteworthy or valuable
unless you have any of particular interest?
I have Courtney's
how did you get her soul?
and MrFURBs
I asked
lol
And I got it in exchange for editting a paper
ah
was it a good paper?
It was dreadful
It was good when I got thru it though
well then at least you had to work for the soul
um
Maybe you could also try duolingo.com
^ I have an account there
Merry Happy Thanksgiving everyone
Guys
oil prices just dropped $7
greetings and hoopy thoonksgooving doktors
oil dropped 7 bucks huh, por que?
thanksgiving was last month
and whats this I hear all of you making casseroles? Casseroles are not a standard thanksgiving meal item.
alex celebrated with me today :P
Tsk
She been in the states so long though lol
lol still technically not a citizen
Honestly if you were both smart, you would take this perfect excuse to have two thanksgivings
hehe
definitely should do that
And at the better thanksgiving feel free to add bacon to your turkey and maple desserts to your posterior cushions.
lol
I went out for Thanksgiving dinner
since my family is not here

Holsteins

Through the steam sale?
Yes!
It was $10
Question: Is Factorio worth my money?
how much is it going for?
$17, I think m31 plays it
hmm I don't know if i'd pay that for it. I may wait for a sale
Sadly its not on steam yet
there's a demo on the site you could try
^
true
Ian: planetary annihilation good or bad
its been on my wishlist since a long friggin time ago lol
Its fantastic
oh good
Its a totally fresh RTS
which is great
and single player is pretty good

I searched for decosun in planetary annihilation and there were two results, both called decosun
odd

i'm now caught up on the 100
that was fast
lol
literally two days of doing nothing but watching the 100 for 8 hours while playing random games
sounds delightful lol
it was
greetings
so what did you think of The 100?
also I just saw hunger games
you like?
yeah
it was mostly build up though
read the book?
no
match is seriously like 100%
I saw it at a galaxy theater with recliners and stuff though
sooooooo gooooood
the girl i went with read the books
she said it matched with them well, but they kinda left out a bit about... that one dude
i am bad with names
sec
ok, there's only like 1 or 2 very small details that arent that big of a deal
but still
yeah, she said it was more like a psychological type thing they can't really put in a movie
she mentioned that in the books a bigger deal is made over the significance of the roses
yeah
and how they cover the smell of blood on white beard dude
also, the fact that peeta flips shit is a lot more jerking in the book and they make a very large deal about it
but given time constraints, im super happy with how it turned out in the movie
yeah it was a good movie
i had to pee super bad though
lol
ermahgerd
these new IEMs are amazing
skullcandy got nothing on these
lol
the 100 is very good
much excite
cant wait for the  next one
anywho
off for the night
noo
dont leave me
He left you brandon

hi
hey
Well today was my first day of employment with the hospital
how'd it go?
and I said "lol" to the picture
it was okay
lol
I'm not allowed to do the IT
and the guy they brought in was an idiot
that sounds not fun
it took him half an hour to find the IP for a printer
that he installed
poor guy
all the while I was not allowed to say anything
why not?
it was new levels of frustrating
the hospitals IT is outsourced
they bring people in to do it
so I can't say "hey bud, let me do it"
interesting. you couldnt have just told him what he was doing wrong? lol
No
lol
So I kept dropping hints
lol
Still I get paid more to do less work
so I can't really complain
true
you just have to put up with some IT frustraiton
and I also inherit all the old extra IT equipment from my previous boss
since he doesn't know what to do with it
So later this week I will have six computers with i5s in them and at least 4G of RAM each
for $0
wow
crypto farm!
Now thats a deal eh?
^
Exactly
you'd probably need GPUs to make that even remotely close to profitable though
Yeah
I could pick up some cheap ones
I'm going to have to buy a couple hard drives too, since I can't keep the data clearly
But thats no big deal
i bought a 2 tb 7200 RPM HDD on newegg two days ago
How much?
$80?
it was around that, yeah
i dont remember exactly
I'm thinking about picking up one of these:
what for?
My computer?
lol
yeah but for doing what on the computer?
Bragging rights and more power than I need
lol
That's what I have now
i have i7 4770K 3.5 GHz
That's pretty good
yeah
hmmm
or I could just get a new graphics card
that would probably be a more noticable investment
That is true
but my current card works fine
honestly everything works fine
buy more monitors
5 of them right?
lol
yes
Then I can do full circle flight simulation
That would be cool
yeah, most games/simulations dont seem to support ultra wide FOV very well
you get a strong fisheye effect
I know IL-2 sturmovich supports full cockpit wrap around
I had a mimosa with my dinner
it was much needed after today
never had a mimosa
i imagine it's refreshing
I'm also amazed at how the internet just evolves things
Mimosas are pretty good
Champagne and OJ yeah?
Champagne or Sparking white wine and OJ
yes
Champagne is actually lower quality then most sparkling wines, as its not aged.
makes sense
i have super aged pasta salad in my fridge
i dont think you could argue that it is better because of it though
only things that ferment require aging
well, it had red wine vinegar
lol
lol
and aged dill is the best
like
the BEST
i like dill
I don't think you'd like THIS dill, in the quantity he has it in that salad
not to mention it is covered in mold
i am just going to throw that entire container away
ewww
mold
lol
Dill is great though
false
lol
that pasta kinda ruined brandon's dill tastebuds
this programming languages hw is kinda long
yes it is indeed
and i'm gonna have to do it all tomorrow
all I have left is save and reset
oh nice
300ish lines so far
and about 3 hours in
not too terrible, but you've done this before :F
i've never really done java gui stuff before
i tried once years ago, in like 8th grade but I had no clue wtf I was doing
lol
you gonna be super busy tomorrow?
probably
I'm probably gonna need help :F
projects everywhere
yeah
woo PL HW done :D
this is some damn ugly code
his lecture slides are so fucking confusing
?
I can't tell where one project begins or ends
nearly everything you need is in lecture 24
they all seem together
when the title at the top changes, it's all new code
that would make sense
i've read through it twice trying to figure it all out :F
just reference it, dont bother reading it all
i'm also trying to figure out how/where to run and install these java things
lol
install jre and jdk
in linux?
add jdk to system path variable if it isnt auto added
i used windows
windows was already set up for java dev on my machine
because I've done windows android dev
right
<<< what does that mean
lol
oh
wait
not that line
<<< 
that ;one
lol
right click my computer -> properties -> advanced -> environment variables
you have to do two things there
add "JAVA_HOME" in the top box
and set it to C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_11\bin or whatever it is for you
then in the bottom one, find Path
and add this to the end:
;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_11\bin
with the ; in front
ok
unless it already added either of those
i will keep that in mind
once you do that, you can use java/javac via command line
ok so the bin folder for my jdk was at C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk1.8.0_25\bin
so that's what I use for the two thingies
yes
okiday
so now that i have all that done, I should be able to create files ending in .java and have java code in them, and through windows command line I do javac FILENAME.java and it'll compile them
yes
then you do java programname and it will run it
alrighty
windows programming is weird
and new
i've never used a windows terminal before
lol
as in programming a window, or programming on windows?
oh
lol
it's infuriating compare to linux
the fucking up and down arrows make no sense
at all
how do i open a terminal
jesus
lol
win + r -> cmd
aha
thanks
lol
stupid networking class
its final is on 12/17
so is my game dev class
how do I turn off sublime's auto-finishing of parentheses
I couldnt find it in preferences
idk
i leave it on
well fine then :F
lol
yayyy I got a simple window to open :P
lol
how many classes did you have?
uhhh
so a few listeners, a window manager, and probably something to deal with handling the colors
pretty much
do you have to include other files in your main file?
just do it all in one file
that's how he wants it turned in
oh
ok
if I have two classes in the same file, it's giving me an error saying it should be in a file of its own because its public
WindowApplication.java:13: error: class WindowDestroyer is public, should be dec
lared in a file named WindowDestroyer.java
public class WindowDestroyer implements WindowListener{
      ^
make it private and nest it
nest it in public WindowApplication or whatever you named yours
and you may want to skip a few slides ahead
lol
it says that there's a better way of using window destroyers
yeah, i'm just trying to get the basics down first
welp, i am going to bed. have fun writing java
window destroyer...
yes
we computer scientists like to make dramatic names
deleter is not cool enough
and remover just sounds stupid
lol
DESTROYER
the delete methods in my project's controllers are all named destroy
that's just rails convention though
lol awesome
so the guitarist for Delain got shot by their confetti launcher thing during a show
he finished the show
oh shit
found out afterward that he busted his nutsack open and was bleeding badly
and nearly lost one of his testicles
OH SHIT DUDE
DUDE
NOOOOO
he finished the freaking show like that
. . .
ughhghghghghhghghg
lol
nope
nope nope nope nope nope
nope
very uncomfortable pain
no duh
lol
i only need a 50% on my networking final to get a b in the class
and a 100% to get an A :(
mmmeh
hemmm
OH MY GOD MICROSOFT YOU PIECE OF CRAP LET ME BUY A WINDOWS 7 KEY
does not want windows 8
so the code that our programming languages teacher used in his powerpoint doesn't compile
lol
ah, yes it does, i'm a derp and named the file incorrectly
gg
I don't like the way we're doing this section of the class
we're supposed to write a java application
which is fine
but we're basically putting a ton of things together from two days of class, and a few of the things in the assignment we havent even been taught
and as someone who has never used java before, this isnt easy
:F
wait youve never used java?
never
that's the assignment
eeeew gui
yeah i have no idea what the hell i'm doing
the whole class structure of java is confusing me
I have a few text boxes, the color rectangle thing, and some labels for the text boxes
Brandon, for when you get home:
#1. Tacos?
#2. HALP MEHHHH (how the fuck do you do the menu with the color names)
tacos, yes
help, sure
but i also have to do some python stuff tonight
i think basically everything for the assignment is covered by the lectures though
the thing on the right with all the colors that you can select wasnt as far as I could tell
i think he had a list selection thing somewhere in the lecture
it's easy enough anyways
also java exceptions are totally useless for debugging purposes
follows the same pattern as everything else
lol. just find the line number and then look at the code
most of the time i just made a typo or didnt capitalize something
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerException
       at java.awt.Container.addImpl(Unknown Source)
       at java.awt.Container.add(Unknown Source)
       at ColorSampler.<init>(ColorSampler.java:74)
       at ColorSampler.main(ColorSampler.java:45)
it seems like my add buttons thing didnt work
so wherever you are trying to add to the color sampler im guessing?
I added buttons
but yeah
it compiles
that's a runtime thing
oh, i see
so much rain outside
:l
indeed
getContentPane().add(buttonRedUp);
is that not how you add buttons?
i was driving on mccarran and drove through a puddle in the middle of the road
it was strangely deep
yeah mccarran over on the school side is really bad
only caught my right wheel though so it started torquing my car to the right
lol
i was like "dafuq was that"
are you specifying a layout type?
grid, gridbag, flow, etc?
 getContentPane().setLayout(null);
are you setting the buttons bounds or whatever?
 buttonRedUp.setBounds(200,340,100,50);
are you instantiating buttonredup?
 buttonRedUp = new JButton("+");
is the line above whatever is causing problems correct?
yep
perhaps you should just show me your code
lol
sec
i'm removing that stuff and making sure it still works
yep
it works
umm
so, i finally threw out the pasta salad of dill
lol
and the world is at peace
actually i did that and the sky started weeping
well yeah because now the dill is right underneath the clouds
so the clouds could smell it
and cried
but noses smell and eyes cry
so are clouds noses or eyes?
they have both noses and eyes
multiple per cloud
that's why they're so sensitive
when are we doing tacos? 10?
join us tony
you can buy a last minute flight
the low cost of tacos will help to offset that cost
whenever you want, alex is sick so she doesnt want any and i'm getting tired of writing java code and it not working because of some weird issue. These all being in one file is a pain in the ass
lol
one file is easier imo
uglier but easier
easier, but wayyyy harder to follow
but yes, i need a break from networking python code
i'm probably just going to get what I have to run and turn that in
because i'm 99% overdone
how much are you missing?
once I get it to work i'll let you know
lol
lol
if it works like it should, once I get it to run it should be nearly done
lol noooo...
otherwise i'm going to undo the changes I made just now and leave it with missing the list
the list is probably a big chunk of the grade though
I have the functionality behind the list
just not the actual list
how do you have functionality of the list without the list? lol
and honestly i'm probably fine getting a mediocre grade on this
I have the ability to get multiple colors from the file, and the ability to write them all back, and the ability to change them. the problem arose when I tried implementing the switches between colors
being able to change the current color is a big part though
there's several bullet points that rely on there being a list
and it's really not that hard to do the list
easy for you to say lol
you're done
make the list like anything else. populate it with data. add a click event listener
when a color is clicked change the stuff to show the new color
yeah, thats what I wrote
i'm just not done fixing it yet
ok
break/taco time
lol
ready?
yes
lezdoit
lez
how is transistor mez?
confusing
pretty game
absolutely gorgeous
not very user friendly
got tired of getting ruined in league
lol
now i dunno what to do
stearthone
hahno
that was a weird freakin game
hi
hi
hi :I
I just put on a pot of albondigas soup
that reminds me, i have no food
i should get food
food is good
We also have no good food
plenty of edible things
just nothing i want
i discovered 4 tacos in my fridge
oh yeah
you didnt finish them
how far did you get with the java thing?
oh also i have your last homework
this freaking computer oh my god <3
just bought the parts over black friday
specs?
8core 4GHz processor, 8GB ram, 2TB SSHD, Radeon R9 270
boots in about 10 seconds
is that 2TB SSHD as in a hybrid drive?
yes
I considered getting a hybrid drive
ended up just getting a small ssd and a 2tb hdd
I might get a dedicated ssd later, but this is great for me atm :)
my 128 gb ssd was almost full within like.. 2 days. lol
lol
if I got one, I think I would only put the OS and one or two games on it
i only put windows and core programs on mine
i might have a VM on it too
which takes like 20 gb
not a bad idea
window's page file or something takes a ton of space
windows 8 is taking up a lot of space in my brain... Skype is so much different
lol
no idea how to navigate it anymore lol
yuck windows 8
im getting used to it
whenever i have to help my mom on her windows 8 laptop, it's like i'm learning everything all over again
lol
time to stress test the rig a bit... *starts up planetside 2 at max graphics*
umm I got the program to run, and it had all the code for a list, but the list didnt show up and I needed sleep
what was the last one?
i dont remember
prolog i guess
you got 99+10
you lost 1 point for not naming your reverse method reverse
well gg me then.. lol who the hell cares
lol
you named it "myreverse"
lolol
reason it wasnt reverse was because we thought there was a predefined reverse function
lol
they're making a suicide squad movie?
yeah
interesting
kinda sad that deadshot isnt the guy they used in arrow
he was good
especially knowing that "SUH" will be playing his son most likely :F
well, as top comment said, his son isn't mentioned much
so hopefully SUH stays away
lol
lol
suh?
jaden in that newish futuristic movie with both will and him
cant remember what its called
after earth
thats the one
why suh lol
that was like 30% of what he said
"yes suh"
"ok suh"
lol oh
"but suh!"
tomorrow is the end of the school week o_O
that was fast
lol
y it feel like midnight already
iunno
so uh
titanfall for $9
mmmeh
so uh
idk if its worth $9 lol
lol yeah
it was a pure hype title
it was enjoyable for a small amount of time
then it got frustrating
it also didnt run very well on the xbone
and repetitive
i'd rather play BF4 than TF
me too
>_<
>_>
<_<
you suggesting what I think you're suggesting?
no
because work to do
league of lege-oh
lol
I: ok
i have networking/HCI projects
and finals
:F
networking is almost done at least
and HCI is like 1/3 - 1/2 done
progress
yep
senior projects just needs a little documentation sprinkled in to make the teacher happy, then that will be ready to present too
also i am reading Divergent, so i tend to just go back to that in my free time :p
almost done with it
lol
how is it
it's really good
reminds me a bit of Ender's Shadow
brandon want to watch the two parts of the crossover thingy tonight after alex gets off work?
there's two parts?
also i already watched flash
lol
oh
well then
lol
yeah flash is the first part and arrow is the second
ah
didnt realize they both were doing crossovers
but sure
check out the video
it looks like a full game now
that map and warp feature looks awesome
if onlly other aspects of the game weren't so derpy
i just don't like starmade's atmosphere
there's something about that game that I just dont like
lol originally it seemed like a derpy program that you mess around with and get bored of playing
supposedly its much more fun now
inb4 docs over the top starmade faction?
oh good god
Starmade is the Starbound of Minecraft
you know
that's a really good analogy
like
ITS' WHAT IT IS
a perfect fit
I KNOW
lol
I'M RAGING IS WHAT I'M DOING
WHY ARE YOU RAGING
Starbound is better than Terraria in my opinion
DID YOU GET SHREKKED IN LOL OR SOMETHING
lol no
but
butttttttt
Terraria is 2D Minecraft. Terraria in space is Starbound. Starmade is 3D Starbound, which means Starmade is Minecraft in space.
scratcher
SPACE
BUTT SCRATCHER
!!!
I just wish Starmades mechanics were better
they're improving
Fuck it I'm gonna make a game called...uh...STARCRAFT
lol
lol
Planetary Annihilation is pretty good
Its a ton of fun
i'm gonna make one called Terraristarform
oh yeah, i have that don't I
Craftmade
Terrabound
Crafterramadebound
"Earthbound"
Minebound
Voxel Simulator

Spacecraft?
Voxel Simulator  IN SPACE
lol spacecraft
lol
lol
theyre planning on adding lua-programmed drones as well
^
as in you code them yourself
^
turtles
yes
They said that ages ago
AGES
WHERE ARE THEY
THANKS OBAMA
furb says soon
(tm)
just like minecraft said they were going to make a modding api
FURB is the driver of the hype train
AGES AGO
THANKS JEB
he's a community moderator for starmade
THANKS FRUB
so meh
lol
Choo choo all aboard the hype train
I think starmade's problem is its hype train is bigger than the game is
starmade looks boring
it COULD be the best thing ever
but it IS boring
it looks bland
compare it to two years ago and you'll take that back instantly
lol
i just looked at the video
still looks bland
it just looks so square
somehow minecraft looks less square than starmade
maybe because 99% of the blocks in starmade are actually squares
and minecraft is like 70%
everything in starmade looks flat
and dark
well space is dark
doesnt mean the game has to be dark
lol
this actually looks cooo
*cool
i'll just wait for star citizen
star citizen or elite dangerous
welp, finished Divergent
it's like 1984 crossed with Ender's Shadow
good book
heard the movie wasnt horrible either
it was very good
are we gonna watch arrow tonight?
depends on how late you want to stay up
we need to watch flash first
and we just got home and need to eat dinner
perhaps arrow tomorrow then?
sounds like a plan
alex gets off at 9 tomorrow so we won't be so late
yay got a huge chunk of my HCI project finished
i just updated skype
weird
I:
hm
hey brandog you there?
yes
hey andog you there?
well that was annoying
my power went out
and im guessing my router is dead by the fact that these messages arent sending
hi sorry power went out briefly
been having a crazy day
router went out last night
so had to get a new one
alex got katie a gift card that ended up being used by some random person (we think) and instead of having 20 bucks it has 2
and yeah
welp
anyway I was gonna say we can't do arrow tonight since alex is going to rileys
good ol' reno
lol
most unreliable power grid
seriously
oh, some minor rain? I TAKE YOUR POWAHHHH
lol
^reno's power grid
i'm just glad my router actually still works after that
did you watch the new 100 yet?
no
I havent yet either
could do that tonight instead of arrow
y not both?
see above, alex going to rileys to spend the night because katie has her graduation at 8am and they're also doing a thanksgiving thing tonight I think
that message isnt above anywhere
lol
<<< 
shh
i overlooked it
technically you probably underlooked it
i skipped right over it
lol
did you see the divergent movie?
nope
i also want to watch that
however
me too
i am out of food except for asian food
and you have my rice cooker pot still
lol
I made guac and salsa last night, and the pot is clean
want to have spam musubi with me later?
sounds like a date ;)
lol
lol
dinner and a movie!
woo
and a tv show
I just had canes like an hour ago though, so i wont be hungry for a while
i am starving
all i had was 3 chewy bars
lol
lol come steal some chips/guac/salsa
i could, or i could go to the store... though i really don't feel like doing that :F
lol
store = toomuchwork
but it is also a longer term solution
indeed
how is it that nearly every episode of etho's flyboys starts with him crashing a helicopter
lol
i haven't been watching it
I just watch it for the builds other people do
they're kinda cool
the thing they have for copypasta stuff is neat, kinda like the old builder but easier to set up
also the vehicles mod is pretty impressively done
lol
imma come steal chipsamole
lolk
i'll unlock the door
OK BE OVER IN A SEC
OK TONY COME OVER
DO IT I DARE YOU
naw
aww
spammmmm musubiiiiii
soon*tm*
going to get alex now, then i just have to drop her off at rileys
then movie/show/food
yay
Dear Steam,
Just because a game has War or Space in the title does not mean I want to play it.
Thanks,

lol
I hate that word
most people do
and I hate people who like that word
i like that word
it has a two y's in it
which is rare
and I like the letter y
good god I forgot how terribly bad I had to pee
lol
practically sprinted home once I realized
you know, i do have a toilet here
lol
yes you do
honestly I don't know why I didnt think of that
lol
lol
my networking homework gives instructions on how to clear your browser cache.... with netscape 7
i think this assignment might be a little old
Don't update to Skype 6.22
It has the worlds worst UI
lol
No really
its so so so so bad
They made everything into bubbles
and its all so cluttered
They should fire the designer
it doesn't seem so bad, but it looks like it's a lot less dense
everything has so much padding
Its sloppy
Its like using large icons to view the contents of my folders
it is just using microsoft's new design stuff
which is terrible
well, new as in metro/win phone/win8 +
You know, Microsoft in general is just bad at ui
The thing is
old school windows is great
It works
and everyone likes it
why do they try anything else?
win 7 is good
^
poor win 9
never even got a chance
Windows 7 has all the features you need with the classic windows stuff
lol
Hopefully they go back to the old ways for Win 10
they wont
How do you know?
they're still pushing windows tablets
which are actually pretty nice
but i dont want a tablet friendly OS on my desktop :l
^
Thats it right there
I want a desktop OS
not some tablet OS
on my desktop
desktop and tablet design are very different
Exactly
Why don't they understand that
my desktop doesn't need giant everything to accomodate touch ui
^
stupid java thinks 1.19813383E8 is smaller than 126.1741878945254
umm
why
lol
idk but this is being a pain in the ass
is it overflowing or something?
it's just a really long number
that tends to break stuff
i'm using a double to represent it
could use a long
or a long double
if that's a thing in java
i need decimla precision
decimal*
right
long double
or long float
that wont work
whelp
gotta use a threshold i guess
what do you need that kind of precision for?
finding the nearest building to your click coordinates on a map
ah
yeah that kind of precision probably isnt needed is it?
it is
all im doing is decimal level precision
porque?
latitude/longitude doesnt really use big numbers
it's like +/- 200 ish
so decimals are important
beinbg off by .1 means many miles
ahh, gotcha
well damn, there's my problem
i forgot a decimal point when i entered SEM's coordinates
i had its longitude set to -119813443 instead of -119.813443
lol
so andrew
are we gonna watch arrow today?
well
alex gets off work at 1130
so
:F
<_>
we still could
it would just be very late
bam
^
First thing I did
lol
me too
lol
everyone loves recursive trees
I just wish it was random gen every refresh
yeah wouldnt that be cool
do it
done
wow
so fast
lol
WOW ANOTHER MINECRAFT BUT ONLINE
my apartment smells so weird
a mix of mexican food and vanilla air freshner
mine smells like chicken parm
apparently I smelled like it on the car ride home
lol
so alex thought i got food or something
but I convinced her it was just the AC blowing old in n out fumes
lol
super impressive dinner
also there are two pieces of chicken left, so if you want one you're entitled to it sir
i'm pretty sure that game video you linked is ripping off some mc texture packs for those trees
exactly my thoughts
cant remember the name of it, but genny and bdubs always use it on ftb etc
yeah
sphax?
yeeep
that's the one
the grappling hook in this game is pretty cool actually
lol
minecraft! with a bunch of derp textures and grappling hooks!
and volumetric fog or something
seems like minecraft simulator 
you know, minecraft is a really simple game
it is
this game is much less simple than minecraft even
which is interesting
well
maybe not much less simple
but it does seem more complicated code-wise
and it has bendable terrain
it's like mc with mods
well, it has nice shading stuff, but that's usually just code reuse
yeah
the fog was cool
and bending terrain doesnt seem that difficult
not like this, at least
red faction's terrain deformation was amazing
indeed it was
you could make digging simulator  with red faction's engine
I barely played that game
lol
but I remember
I played it a bunch until the disk was lost
"lost"
pretty sure this dude stole it
lol
i really like this game's player model
big block
lol
it really captures the essence of the game
I HAVE A HUGE ORANGE BLOCK
I MEAN CLOCK
OR SOMETHING
anywho
off to bed
thanks again for the help
np
good night
drive safe
buenos noches
bueno nachos
nachos buenos
i want nachos
they do sound good
Ricardos
we should ricardos over winter break
^
yes
I will be there around new years
so :P
yes
+1 for ricardos
so bored
are you
are you really
really bored
analysis homework is hard
mostly because i'm teaching myself graphs
but you already have #1 answered!
I just finished
but I don't understand most of it
like what?
graphs are good to know
good for interviews too
yeah, i'm gonna study up a ton later
might have some questions for you at some point
AI is nothing but graphs
lol
arrow tonight? alex gets off at 530
cant
gotta do this networking EC once my group members finish making their changes
whelp
lol
we tried
we just weren't meant to watch arrow this week
ever have so much stuff to do you wanted to nap
lol
yep, back in the dorms that happened all the time
ended up sleeping like 18 hours one day
god.
damn.
it.
my teammate really fucked this code up....
gg teammate
he spent two days doing this, and it doesnt work, doesnt follow our design, is terrible code, and it is like 2 hours max worth of changes
...great
this is such a mess
...
"oh yeah, i added broadcasting to the application layer"
def broadcastMessage(self,message):
   #Send to all known Users
   return
that's an empty damn function with a comment inside that does nothing
what the hell
is he a partner who you knew would disappoint?
he's the guy in my senior project group who has hardly contributed
ahah
how goes fixing all the code?
well, it's all fixed i think, as close as it will get at least
short of a rewrite
but, broadcasting doesnt work
because the transport layer can't handle multiple messages at once
of course at this point I am starting to not care about this project
I'd be totally fine with commenting out the part that asks if you want to do a 1-1 message or a broadcast and just ignoring that that was ever a planned feature
seems legit
when you rewrote it did you just forget about multi-messages? seems like a design flaw
we didnt rewrite it
and i didnt write the network layer
er, transport
aha
gotcha
I have a game design midterm that I am dreading tomorrow
I have no idea what to expect
mario is the answer
sorry, game design "midterm"
mid term, at the end of the term
seems legit
right
well its the second one
and we don't have a final exam
just a final project
so
got that going for me
i have to stay on campus till 5 tomorrow
I will probably be there til then as well working on the game
because sengupta took forever to get back to us when we said the time slot he gave us to present this demo wouldnt work
lame
we all just decided to collectively rage quit with broadcasting
seems like something i'd agree to lol
My sorority is getting a new chapter at the Reno university

True dat
lol
this program is the devil and i just want to stop
Make the end command 666
actually we have a bug
the frame window becomes 6,6,6
we have no clue why
and it breaks it
SATAN
hahahaha
that's what was breaking broadcast mode
so we're just ignoring broadcasting and pretending it was never an intended feature
How dare you!
>.>
don click dat
lol
my mom saw a rick roll the other day
she was really confused
welp, this program is good enough. i did the extra credit portion so it should make up for the general shittiness of the rest of it
-111
=666
666/= 222
= 3
half life 3 confirmed

networking can go suck a duck
yeah so can whatever DoS'd me
probably just some error somewhere
but still
hey
i'm a duck
rude
Flying home for the holidays guys
1 whole duck?
yes
Do you mean networking as in the computer course or networking in the social sense
Cause they both might need a duck
the computer course
I'll agree with you there
lol
dup sog
yello
green
the hearthstone expansion is being rolled out right now. maintainence. sadface because i'm not gonna get to look at it before class :(
hearthstone is cancer
is not
hearthstone is drugs
its like the opposite of cancer
its rainbows and butterflys and yeah
the opposite of cancer is cells that never replicate
still leads to death
I said LIKE the opposite
no
you didnt
so its cells that don't replicate OFTEN
no
<<< 
it is drugs! DRUGS!
<<< 
<<< 
gg no re I have faith muthafucka
thats what bob marley said
and he died
he was shot by the sherriff
no
he shot the sheriff
because he shot the sheriff
right
no
it was a head shot
and he was like "BOOM HEADSHOT!"
and the deputy, who became sheriff because the sheriff was dead, shot him back
ggnore I have faith muthafucka
nah the deputee had commitment issues
lol
he was only deputy because his mom forced him
lol deputee wat
lol
we're super good at spelling this morning
i had weird dreams last night
me3
lots of them
i dont remember any but one
I forget what mine was though
I only had one
and i remember there was a kitten involved in another
lol
I bet one of them involved a semi-nightmare about networking
the first one, i was buying second-hand bestbuy goods from my uncle off a card table at the end of my driveway
i was buying a pen
lolwat
and then he left
in the middle of the transaction
so i sat there
for hours
went inside and was like "dafuq"
went back out
trash peple came buy and trashed the table
lol
oh also
my neighbors were like 10 foot tall aliens
o.O
wooooow bliz
literally just changed the message to read "maintainence is expected to be finished around 1pm pst" from 12pm :(
now I really dont get to look before class
and I have hw tonight :(
laaaame
DO YOU SEE MY SADFACES!?!?!?!11ELEVEN!!!
its a sign from god
wow, the moment I have to go to class it gets released
it really is a sign from the gods
lol
lol andrew it came out this saturday... or was it sunday
nah, it came out in arena then
i'm talking about constructed
couldnt get gvg packs til today
also if you log in soon you get 3 free packs
ah true
wat
wat game
oh
i know what that is
lol
hearthstone
yep
yuckstone
I think there needs to be a new "Don't hate unless you try it" rule
at least tony's played it :F
i've seen it
but you haven't played it
good once
i just hate the rngs
i can get lost in it though lol
the rng's are what makes it playable though
without rng, the game would be 100% knowledge
just pray to rngesus
and you could make bots that beat players 100% of the time
think of chess
no rng
chess isnt a solved game
bots win
no
bots dont always win
they're like 99% winrate
against pros
but they dont always win!
lol
imagine a game like that though
and are slow if you get that advanced
nobody would play
rng is necessary for hearthstone to be a thing
but you assume the opponent is omniscent
there is still uncertaintny
if not rng
uncertainty*
in a world without rng, all the decks would be the same, or they'd be worse than someone elses
that isnt rng
without rng you would just choose what cards to draw
no, but without rng it makes it possible to have hard counters for every deck until you end up with one ultimate deck
btw, with the no rng i'm including not random card draw
so
unplayable
but the deck itself isnt random in the real game
so removal of rng doesnt change that
huh
or is it
lol idk
the draws from the deck is random
but the pool of potentially drawn cards - do you choose them?
the deck itself is made up of 30 cards picked by the person playing
yes
that's exactly my point
the deck is chosen, and unknown to the opponent
so there is still uncertainty
so, imagine a world without randomly drawn cards. you pick the order of your 30 cards, so, with the current card pool, there are unstoppable victory conditions by turn 5
literally nothing the opponent could do if you order your cards perfectly
again, unplayable
that just sounds like a broken game
right, but once you add in random draws it becomes balanced
because you can't rely on wombo combo
you have to hedge your bets into different cost cards, and yes, at some point you hope you draw the right cards even then
but you have to make a deck that has a good chance to win
not a 100% chance to win
hence the need for rng
tbh i forgot what the purpose of this conversation was
lol
the rng's are what makes it playable though
without rng, the game would be 100% knowledge
<<< 
anyway, I got to defend my game
so :P
well, if you add in a card that can disrupt the opponent enough to make it so no card sequence is 100% unbeatable, then it can still be playable
but then the opponent could play around that specific card being in the opponent's hand, start playing the turn 5 combo, and have another unbeatable combo ready by turn 8 or something
they'd have to keep adding cards to counter
which defeats the purpose of the game
unless their opponent has a card that forces them to miss a turn or something
play and find out
there are cards _sort of_ like that
or has a trap card!
and they activate the trap
lol
like I said, playing around those is easy
in any given competitive _popular_ game there is probably a dice roll somewhere in there
what if there's a card that forces my opponent to discard his entire hand?
there is, again, _sort of_
lol
so then, that would be unpredictable but not rng
then you order your deck to play around your first X cards being discarded
what if i do it again?
then you delay further
you have to decide to either play defensively expecting me to do that however many times, or assume i wont and go for the kill
also, such a card would be so overpowered that it would never make it into the game
you're basically turning a card game into rock paper scissors
in its current state, sure
but without rng, maybe not
but that's what we're talking about
the game in its current state
my point is, you could make it playable without rng by adding in some cards to introduce uncertainty in its place
not just some cards
you'd restructure the entire game into something completely different
basically turning hearthstone into yugioh without dice rolls
lol
totally different
lol
lol
yugioh still has rng though
in drawing cards
but even yugioh has shuffled decks, yeah
if you're good at shuffling you can set up your game pretty well though lol
even in tournaments the last person to shuffle the cards in your deck is you
your opponent shuffles, then you shuffle
but i am my opponent's opponent
right
i smell an unterminated loop
so blue becomes yellow and green becomes a fire truck
your opponent shuffles your deck, then you shuffle your own deck
no unterminated loop
just a do, then do
but then he didnt shuffle his deck last
what if I am actually him?
golks
folks
O.o
stahp
o>o
lol
tony we enjoy our stupid conversations
we really do
we have them all the time
lol
join in on our pseudo-logical back and forths
sometimes they end spectacularly like that time at the vietnamese food place
i forgot what happened but it was good
I don't remember that one
I just remember cracking up at the end of it
you used my logic against me somehow and i was just like "touche"
lol
that's gonna bug me now
lol
I want to know
my plan works!
how did I win such a conversation
muwahahaha
idk
it was last time we went
alex was there, maybe she remembers
maybe
doubtful though
lol
she usually just tunes out
i was gonna say, most people do
yeah
lol
were you both arguing in the same direction?
lol
we usually argue in different directions even though we see what each other is saying
nah, he was trying to make some kind of point and I ended up using exactly what he said to win my end
yeah
we both know the correct point of view
we just argue to argue
lol
intellectual exercises in futile arguments 101
lol
lol
sometimes when Nao and I are arguing we're arguing the same point with different logics
10/10 would pass with flying colors
lol
lol
not if Sengupta taught it
true
>_< :(
we'd have a tough time with that
ooh
or sushil
god
he'd just say no
yep
and be done with it
and then 3 days later be like "yes"
but forgot that you said it 3 days before
well at least we'd pass eventually then
every time i see his name as sushi and want sushi
yuck
you dont want to eat him
no i want sushi
no, you really dont
he's not a nice guy
he'd probably taste horrible
THE RAW FISH PEOPLE
what raw fish people?
isnt that kinda redundant
you could just call them fish people
The Roffish People
From Roferia
why are you shouting about people from Roferia?
Because I want to eat raw fish atop a bed of rice dipped in soy sauce graced with a smear of wasabi.
y raw fish
y no cooked
is delicious
no
that sounds delicious, what does it have to do with people from Roferia?
is yuck and slime
eat soba
tell people is worms
oysters are yuck and slime
also delicious
tasty
but slime
mussels and oysters and clams are yummy
you people are disgusting
enjoy your ocean boogers
literally
but still delicious
i should be doing work
but
yeahhh
I should be doing linear algebra homework
but :( ?
but it just doesnt sound liike fun
so basically :(
yolo
^swag
#swag*
what would you do if i told you i am hiding under your bed, andrew?
I would say "no you aren't, there's like 90000 gallons of shit under my bed"
lol
we have boxes stacked on boxes stacked next to boxes underneath our bed
what if i am in the box?
then you are a ninja
i am not a ninja
but we knew that already
i am a wizrod
the first wizrod is also a ninja
lol
wizrod of the first order
same things >.>
you're a thing
ok
gotta go present project
enjoy your time with mr sanjit
or shamik
whatever his name is
Bonjour
hola
Quoi de neuf mediecins?
what's up doc?
Yes
lol
lol
Docs
plural
yeah
and its more, "What's new docs?"
aha
but what's up is not an inaccurate translation
so anyways
Sup?
procrastination
sounds like fun
pretty much
welp
he grades hard
im gonna go eat now
didnt go well?
i have no clue
ah
he kept saying it was bad and saying it was good
so ???
lolwat
he said our strongest layer, the transport layer, was too weak
it was like 3x the length of the others
wow
well you did say you didnt support multi-messaging
so it kinda makes sense
broadcasting? no
we didnt have error correction though
ah
I think your main problem was you didnt have enough herpaderpa
oh there was lots of herpaderpa
we lied and said we used dijkstra's algorithm
when we really just used a modified breadth first search
he asked us to show him the dijkstra's code
lol
we showed him that function kinda quickly and were just like "yep, dijkstra's"
i think it worked, too
lol
it really would be difficult to see the difference at a glance
since dijkstra is just modified dfs
oh
other than that it was "def BFS"
wiat
yeah
lol
dijkstra is dfs, not bfs
dijkstra is a lot of work
lol
lol
what is the benefit to using it rather than a bfs?
bfs assumes we have info that you dont have in the real world, usually
even then, dijsktra's takes edge weights in to account
which BFS usually doesn't
right
interesting
I guess
we assumed all edge weights were 1 though
which means BFS is guaranteed to get the shortest path
yeah, but in reality they wouldnt all be 1, would they?
depends on your cost function
if it's just hop count, it would be 1
if it was something like transmission rate over the wire, probably not
gotcha
whuuuut
etho plays hearthstone
lol
no way
lol
he said he may do a video of it
interesting
so andrew
arrow?
yes
in an hour or two?
i've gotta finish this LA
sure
ok this homework is taking forever, i'll just finish it tomorrow
arrow time?
brandoooooon
halooo
hi
hi
would you like to arrow now?
sure
ok
your place?
ok
alrighty, we're on our way :F
i just gave several people my cursors.io hax
except i swapped out the draw code to draw dickbutt
you are amazing
lol
hahaha
3 hours later, I finally managed to get android studio to run this stupid project
android development is easy. android development environments are hard. :(
lol
how's the project going?
it's good enough
also my group member actually made significant improvements on our networking things last night
added retransmissions/timeouts and fixed bugs
nice
made up for being shitty otherwise? lol
he was a good partner, the other one was bad
aha
no pun intended is a pun on unintended
is it?
punintentionally
sup
hai
howsitgoing
hi
so andrew, you know what today is
tocotoesday
yup
indeed
Indeed - teal'c
mmmmhm
indeed
so supposedly Eelke only plans on doing like 5 or 6 lectures for senior projects
which means I may only have one class to go to next semster
wow
nice
...nice
I was going to do Taco Tuesday
was?
but I made a burrito instead
lol
It was going to be a taco I swear
tomorrow my senior project advisor is treating everyone in his lab to mexican food lunch
yum
andrew
lets do something
so I just watched interstellar
weird ending eh? lol
yeah
I haven't seen it yet
other than that, it was a damn good movie
don't spoil it folks
nova and I are playing hearthstone :3
yuck
disgustingstone
gaystone
i'd rather play kidneystone
rofl
that's a lie actually
kidney stones sound terrible
Brandon, you should get planetary annihilation
for the christmas sale
or should i
Its fun if you like RTS games
it is pretty cool
I need to play more
i've only done one game so far
Courtney and I play from time to time
i want fries and bbq sauce
that sounds amazing
Actually
Bottom layer of fries
Layer of beef brisket
then BBQ sauce
= yum
i want food
x_x
holy jesus that looks delicious
yes
The one with all the pickled stuff looks great
my hunger level is over 9000
but i must hold out for tacos
TACO TACO TACO
i just realized i still have taco salad
but i must hold out for taco 2'sday
if we do taco tuesday we have to do it soonish
alex works til 1130 so it'd just be us
oh
well then, want to do it?
yeah, gimme like 10 minutes
gotta finish this game with nova
NOVVVVVVAAAAAAA NO NO NO NO NOOOOOVAAAAAAAAAAA
so
that's a long 10 minutes
yep sorry lol i'm ready
i can drive
okey, on my way
that is a fantastically animated gif
lol
so chrome added a new button in the browser top that scared me a bit
it's now "my chrome"
my name adorns the top of the browser
mine doesnt have that, but now when i close/reopen chrome, it remembers my tabs instead of going to the new tab page
and my settings are still set to go to the new tab page on startup
paging Dr. Andrew
please come in Dr. Andrew
PAGING ANDROSS DESTROYER OF THE LYLAT SYSTEM
lol
ANDROSS CAN NOT BE DEFEATED
planetary annhilation looks good actually
it is
but no tengo tim
mucho studyo
so, my AI final is worth 40% of my grade in that class
lol
wow
kinda makes sense though
since you have no hw
we have weekly quizzes though
he should make those worth more
yeah
40 percent is a lot
30 is much more reasonable imo
he originally planned on having 2 midterms and a final
but we only had 1 midterm
aha
Andross?
Do a barrel roll
lol
Ian
what do you think of the company iSmart?
Check out their logo
well it's upside down but you get it
wow
lol
lol'd pretty hard once I realized
turned my head upside down to see it
then looked at it normally
lol
There's no way all of those are accidental
get professionals
gotta love reno
wind? no power for you!
yeahhhh really annoying
lol
damn familiar
why must my final be so late
because it drags
5 - 7 is too late though :(
it'll be dark and cold and windy
holy shit
yeah
after the first logo blew up on reddit t...yeah
lol
XD
god
pretty quick of them
or
viral marketing
...hm
if they got caught it would be fucking atrocious though
oh hey
we have a final tomorrow
yes
we should study for it after i get back from my final
sounds good to me
heh
why is 5 so far awayyyyyy
i want to take my test nowwww
i have sufficiently studied, and now i want to study for programming languages, but if I start now it will push the AI out of my head before my test
nao where'd you get those flip-up goggles we turned into Splinter Cell?
ren fair booth
dang
ok lol
woof
there it is?
hello this is dog
Hi Dawg
nonono

he's a "cousin". Not directly related, but you know how us canines operate
wolffoxhoundprariedog
what is this, canine centapede?
Pretty much
hi
hi
how was your test?
well, there were two parts that I know I lost points on
dont think I lost a single point anywhere else though
and I knew I would miss points on those two parts
because I didn't understand them
other than the very very high level one sentence explanation
otherwise, an easy test
nice
would you like to join us for a study/pizza party?
gradient descent and back propagation have way too much calculus involved
sure
after i play a move in scrabble and find all of my PL homework/notes
lol
don't forget mine :P
ooh frankie made an h1z1 video
or maybe its just clips of the devs streaming
do you have homework 6?
i'm not sure where I put mine
no clue, if I do its probably in my backpack
well can you check? lol
yeah, sec
gimme like 5 minutes, it's in my car
ok I have searched all the papers in my backpack and I have hw 1-4 :F
lol
i have your 5 and 7
should I head over?
sure, whenever you're ready
how were exams
yo android
only had 1 exam so far
and 2 project demos
3 exams to go
...jeeze
all today?
or next week?
one final today, 2 more next week tuesday and wednesday
blugh
so
this morning was interesting
i got out of the shower at 11 and realized my project demo was scheduled for 11, not 12
got there in record time just as the demo ended
the teacher didn't care though
so then i came home
...
lol uhh
was it uber important?
well it did say that all group members must be present
lol
but the teacher knows I know what I'm doing and work hard
so he didnt care
niuce
gg nao :P
lol
well, i am home, if you wanted to carpool to pl final
sure
also just finished my call with Originate :D
how was that?
Looking at June 8th as a tentative start date
that's like right when you get home isnt it?
nah
graduation is may 15th
oh gotcha
so, wanna hear how I woke up from  my midmorning nap?
of course you do!
so, i was awoken by some pretty loud hammer-like sounds from the people above me
whatever.jpg
went to the bathroom, and just as I was turning on the shower I heard the loudest fricking sex sounds of all time
sounded like they were in the room with me
it was from upstairs
>.>
<.<
so yeah
haha
at least you didnt walk  steps for no reason
in the course of 40 minutes
actually my phone says it was 23 minutes
but that seems low
lol
why the hell
at least you didnt walk  steps only to get wrekt by your teacher
lol
google play store and app store badges are different sizes
according to their respective branding standards
when do you want to leave for our final andrew?
in like 10 minutes or so? or whenever you're ready. i'll drive. gotta drop off some food for alex
10 minutes works for me
okey
pop quiz what are the effects of static binding and dynamic binding GO
other than compile,run time binding
static binbing is done at compile time. This means that variables are bound regardless of the stack/scope.. Dynamic is the opposite
so, with static binding, like in C++, calling bar() { print x; } inside of foo() { int x = 0; bar(); }  when there is a global x = 2, bar will print 2 not 0
because x in bar is statically scoped

So suddenly i've been noticing Danish Butter Cookies all over thanks to Nao....
5-8$ a tin
They're the best
THE BEST
XD Haven't had any in quite a while
I've eaten a few
like
4 tins
lol
haha
They've also got double tins overhere, they were on sale aswell
Danish butter cookies are too dry
you're too dry
Have you ever made danish cookies from scratch?
they are much better
Depends on how many you have at once :P
Never made them from scratch. Would be a challenge
dryyyy
delicioussss
they are though
they are indeed delicious
haven't played Risk of Rain in a while
game
game?
gam
nova and I are playing hearthstone :P
yuck

wow

Tanks?
Planes?

gay
I do not know
what do to for dinner
tanks
pizza
homemade traditional
I don't want to cook
and its cold so I don't want to shop
and there is no where to order from
So I think I'm stuck
I think the only solution is to eat your own leg
Its got hair though
no one likes hair in their food
shave it
although that could be considered cooking
so you are screwed
eat danish butter cookies
too dryyyyyyyyyyy
drink water
hydrate yoself
or better yet, blend them with some vanilla milkshake
ew
yum
They might be good baked into a cream cake
like tiramisu
just because you don't like milk doesn't mean the majority of the world dislikes it :F
I love me some tiramisu
that may be good
add in some chocolate flavor and yumyumyum
i want a fruit and yogurt parfait
gross
no
I want guacamole
why is this guy whistling outside my window
of all the windows to whistle outside of
lol
hi
Hi!

Its nice and warm in Canada
Thanks to the Chinook
All heil Chinook!
lol
Slippery as hell though, don't even try walking the ice will kill you.
its nice and frigid in windy reno
no ice yet thankfully
The ice and the cold winds are always the worst
indeed
wrandon borl are you present?

What a loser, not even present.

the max brenner restaurant is permanently closed
what :<
the who
chocolate restaurant
how the hell is there so much content in these networking slides
each chapter is like 160ish slides
my note sheet for my networking final is 1450 words so far, in size 6 font
lol
with two diagrams
i want to do something bu ti hav eno idea what to do
i hate feeling unproductive
lol
i too want to do something but have nothing to do
yeh
well i have things to do but not really
things i want to do
like what?
but
make a costume for wasteland weekend
beat up clothes, wear goggles, say it's steam punk
lol
kinda
i have ideas but
monday
I dont even have class to look forward to on monday
I just have to sit around until my finals are over :l
when's that
thursday?
yeah
i have a thing to do on thursday evening though
originate invited me to their christmas party
Oh yeah
Max Brener shut down
5evur
T_T
also dude that's awesome
Its too bad they closed
it was a cool restraraunt
speaking of originate, did they ever contact you tony?
nope
save to assume that ship has sailed
they never even talked to you at all?
never
that's kinda how it usually goes
not an acknowledgement and a deny
just nothing
I think only 2 times have companies told me "not you"
I wonder if they just forgot about you
since they don't really have a designer onboarding process
O^O
in that case would I send them a message again
I could ask them what the deal is when I see them, if you want
sure, yes please
hey brandog
brandonnnnnnnnn
do you have flour/sugar?
hi
uhh
no flour
maybe sugar? idk
probably not
damn
alex wants to make oatmeal raisin cookies but we are apparently out of both :F
welp
that may be hard to do without those
it is indeed
lets go on an adventure to winco, i am bored
nahhhh
much study to be done
very analysis
i have done too much study
networking makes my brain hurt
I have gone through every analysis slide twice
not because it is hard but because i dont want to think about it
I have gone through most networking slides once
there were like... 500+
there were 25 ppts, with around 20 slides a piece
so i'm about the same there
there were 5 powerpoints.. with about 130 each x_x
400something
that's just ugly
yes
they are glitchy-ass powerpoints too
gotta view it through google drive for it to be readable
that's odd
if i had MS office i'm sure that would work fine
but I dont
and Dreamspark is impossibly bad
well if you're truly bored and want a break, i'm sure I could convince alex to watch guardians of the galaxy
I got a legit copy of MS Office  through it and was totally unable to install it
bored break movie?
if you guys dont need to study, sure
alex is done with finals
well isnt she lucky
:F
and i'm pretty sure I know dijstra's algorithm like the back of my left calf
i too had to study dijkstra's algorithm
for networking
anywho, i am good for GotG whenever
oh hi, i have wet clothes in the washing machine
brb
you can head over whenever, we're just cleaning the kitchen and making some food (you can have some if you're hungry)
then after food we'll movie
also the door is unlocked
i already ate, so i'll head over whenever you're done eating
ok
ill let ya know
dinner's pretty much finished cooking, we can eat while we watch if you still want to
cleaning took 5ever
lol
(talking to my mom at the moment)
k ready
i can wait till you eat, or we can do it now
whatever you prefer
naoooo
lego
o/ hi
o/
bored
league?
NOLEAGUE
I actually do want to league
but cannot
finalz
dos mas para mi
ok
i'll go apocalyptic shopping then
you see etho's latest fly boys from a few hours ago, andrew?
nope
good?
etho is sooooo bad with guns lol
who puts a sniper scope on an M16, seriously? lol
better to put a red dot on a sniper
he also had a sniper, with a sniper scope
and a sword
two sniper scope'd weapons and a sword
too bad he doesnt have a sniper scope on his sword
wait swords arent snipers?
i thought they were
oh they are
i think the best sniper is C4, isnt it?
probably
tis
landmines are better
360 sniper
tru dat
beebidy boop
cheap leather gloves are hard to find
lol gmod dayz
so derpy
i was running around with a big gun and no ammo
trying to scare people away from confronting me
didnt work
lol
faksjfklsajflk i finally found a weapon
didint realize it was lying on a downed electrical line or something
well shit, had a weapon, ammo, food, everything... was walking and got 1-shot from out of nowhere
sounds like dayz
i shot a guy in the face before i died though
he had a crow bar i think
he ran
lol what a meanie
killin peeps for no reason
he would have killed me
i didnt kill him!
it was a warning shot!
to the face!
non-lethal
lol
it was only a USP
ah, yes, only a .45 caliber bullet to the face
he was fine
now, whatever shot me in the face.... it was a bit stronger
lol
gmod dayz wat
pft no league
gmdz
league requires me to concentrate, gmdz doesnt
lol
i'm doing it!
Who said rocket science was hard?
NASA
You see
they want to protect their jobs
if everyone knew how easy it was
They'd all apply
seems like a conspiracy to me
i pushed random buttons hoping to mess everything up
but nothing happened
hey
also, that sucker is difficult
wolfram is the end-all of math programs
does it show step by step?
yes
even for calculus
I found a better program for matrix operations
wolfram's syntax is too derp for me to do matrices
lol
its matrix syntax is a bit difficult to use
it has a few pages specifically for matrix math though
where you enter values in an actual matrix
I just used my TI-84 for simple matrix math, though
my 89 doesnt like me using my matrix functoins for some reason
lol
The 84 has nice matrix stuff
I think I wrote a program or two to solve more advanced matrx stuff on it
wow
this question on my networking final requires us to have a facebook account
to analyze network traffic while using it
are you doing your final currently?
there's a do-at-home portion
aha
i'm reading it over
gotcha
Facebook suddenly shows me posts from all of my friends instead of only from people I actually have interacted with some time in the past few years
this is unpleasant
lol how so
and how do you set that?
idk
it was random
go to facebook news feed and scroll down
does it tell you to get more friends because it;s out of stuff to show?
hah no
because that's what it's doing for me right now lol
it's showing me stuff from people it usually doesn't, and wont load new stuff
waitaminute
THAT'S AWESOME
DID IT CHANGE SUDDENLY
THAT'S COOL
I CAN NOW SEE EVERYTHING
lol
but if you scroll down does it keep loading?
yeah...
and actually
y it no load 5 me
it's the same peeps
wait yes
no posts
find friends
lol
lol
dafuq facebook
y u test on production
news feed is back to ignoring people i dont care about again
y u friends lol
old highschool people mostly
heh
so
Doktors
When do we go to zee Ricardos?
welp

want to do Ricardos x2?
lol
we could
Deal, and best of luck
Or we could do multiple places
I'm fine with whatever
If you cant, we should get a cardboard cut out of your face and sit it on a seat at recardos
well ricardos is 24hr
^
so if I have to leave the 3rd we could ricardos when courtney gets in town
i have a voodoo doll of Andrew, it's pretty lifelike

May customs recognize my white-girl priveledges
haha customs sucks in vegas

and they took my nuts :(
lol
almonds
Both of them!?
jeez guys
Dang jews
what a nutjob
Jews ruined your trip
Do you guys still want to go on a hike?

Hi
Ian
Hello
Hi
i like hiking
Oh
i'm down
it'd be cold as fuck
dang
but i'm down
the high king has spoken!
No I checked the weathers
I'll dress like Dr. Jones
you don't know the definition of cold as fuck
Lets do ice box
It will be +10 celcius :D
Ice box
it literally snowed on the way to my final this morning
the ground was literally frozen earlier today
lets do it
Yes I do >.>
with snow
Cold as fuck is -45
Brandon Tony
that was directed at tony i think
lol
Ice box
yeah lol
ice box will be cold
I know
rock gets incredibly cold
But we'll be okay
lol
that's why it's called ice box i'm guessing
it's relatively cool during summer
It will probably have water though
in January
idk about that
I like water
doubtful
the waterfall is there in summer
^
It will be +1o in vegas, and here it will be -15 :D
And its a frozen pond in winter
so lets do that
i dare you to stand on the frozen pond
Me?
Only if we go
ian
Yes her
Courtney will do it
cause I own her soul
lol
I probs can cause Im average
probs
probs
eh?
But IF I fall in
Im probs dead
eh?
we'll panic and run away
That
Cause phobia of deep water
totes
it isnt deep
4"
deep
lol
lol
hey man
But will I be able to see whats touching my feet?
i've seen 4" of water before
that's deep
Us desert kids be like: "1" of water? Can't go outside"
lololol
1 of water
you know what I meant
i do
Syntax
but if i were a programming language syntax interpreter, I would not
I already said syntax
When it snows heavy and the door jams we have to shovel ourselves out to go to work
well i said it more completely
Syntax Error
it snowed here over night
Reno sucks
when i woke up the ground was covered in snow
you people are making me cold
within 4 hours there was no snow left
Its 3 cold
yeah i drove/walked to my final in taht
Last year the snow piled up against the garage door and it collapsed in a bit.
lol
thank god I dont have to deal with that level of snowliness
xD
poor Android's computer keeps crashing
sucks to suck
also my oldest system restore option is an hour ago, right AFTER this started happening
did you do anything recently that may cause this?
nothing I can think of, I set up the chromecast alex got me for christmas, but that's it
Are you overheating?
nope, 23C
Delete your system32?
run a virus scan perhaps?
look for error logs
what should I scan with?
I generally use AVG
sounds
good
Avast is also good
Microsoft Security Essentials
Also check the security logs?
lol
security logs?
mse and malwarebytes
yes
which are?
lol
They're in the windows event viewer?
no clue what that is
Windows key
search
event viewer
lol
windows logs
security
System logs are in there too
absolute shitton of audit failures in the security logs
lol
like multiple per second
wuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut
Look at the details of the logs
jesus batman
Check the other logs too
The Virtual Disk service entered the stopped state.
I have like 8000 entries in my security logs total, from 6+ months of using this computer
about a billion of those
and they're all audit success
lol
I have a couple failures
but
not a whole screen of them
it may be because I have a non-legit windows copy but honestly I have no idea
Updating windows is important
can't
yeahhhhhhhhhhhhh
you know, you can get windows 7 for free right?
security updates
are kinda like important
how, and how would I make that work with this computer?
Through UNR, we can get multiple copies for free
I think you can register your existing copy using a key you get from Dreamspark
The keys are for Win 7 pro
idk what you have
this is ultimate
pro can't run 32gb ram
yes it can
it can do 192 GB
o.O
totally not what I read
Home can do up to 16
that's probably what I was thinking then
lol
skillz
so could I convert what I have to pro somehow?
Not sure
never tried
tada
but can you downgrade? lol
Good question
I would assume so
"Windows Anytime Upgrade isn't available in all editions of Windows 7, such as Windows 7 Ultimate edition."
yeah, there is a 3rd party windows 7 downgrader program
That might work
you could always just do a reformat and fresh install
but you need an installation dvd
you can mount the iso
i would assume
or just do it via usb
Still though, there's probably something else that's causing your crashing
since it just randomly started
yeah
avg found 5 threats but it's probably never going to finish
it has 1TB of harddrive to go through
it just finished the ssd
do you actually have 1TB of data though?
5 threats?
what are they
in fact, it's been on /games/steam for about 5 minutes
loooooooooooool
Your HDD is probably only a few hundred gigs though, right?
of used space
uh no
night guys
night
bye
out of 2tb it has almost exactly 1tb left
that's a lot of data
yeah
i'm not even entirely sure what it all is
Still probably only about an hour to scan
ah, it finished with steam finally
that's probably most of it
I have like 50 games installed
probably more actually
I'm using .3 TB on my HDD
and around 90 GB on my SSD
same for me on the SSD, but wayyy more on the HDD
7 threats now
still cant view them until the scan is done
you didnt download another textbook ending in .exe, did you?
no
:F
loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooool
I am impressed with my computer case. The inside is still completely dust-free after half a year of use
well there were 5 trojans and three malware thingies
removed them all
well done duck
holy shit nao i'm impressed
mine's never dust free
although....dog
apparently the trick is to have positive case pressure
so that the only air coming in goes through the fan filters
and nothing gets sucked in at the case's joints/connections/whatever
but, this apartment also has like no dust
which i'm sure helps
know what
i think i blow all my dust into my case
it gets caught on the front of the case grill
i air can it off
x_x
lol
nite
night
ok so this is the longest the computer's gone without crashing, and it's the only time I haven't had twitchtv open in chrome
so clearly you must open twitch now and see if it crashes
yep
twitch is cancer, after all
so i wouldn't be surprised
right
Cancer
just like LoL
well, now i guess I wait and see if it crashes without opening chrome at all
ok i lied
can't not use chrome
you could use IE
like i said
have to use chrome
lol
gonna study and not open twitch, see if that does anything
if it still crashes then i'm gonna get your help doing a fresh install of win 7 pro and keep the few things I may need (like gamemaker) for finals on a flash drive
doing a fresh install is ezpz
put iso on flashdrive, boot from flashdrive, do install
right, first two parts I haven't done before, don't you have to format a flash drive for that?
also i only have 8gb drives
8gb is fine
ok
i think the installer is like 6
puting the iso on a flashdrive isnt hard
google it
booting from flashdrive is easy too
trying not to use chrome :F
lol
set boot order in bios so that the flashdrive is higher than the SSD/HDD
you have a phone, that can google too
but yeah
NO IT CANT
then plug usb in
reboot
JEEZ
done
MY PHONE IS BROKEDED TOO
You can't use chrome?
+1 for Ultron
^
did you have to do something weird to actually download windows 7 from the webstore thing?
my dreamspark account isnt working on the store
did you make the account with your .edu email?
yeah
did you find win 7 pro free? or is it not there for you?
I found it, but I have to sign in to get it, and it's not accepting my username from dreamspark
Umm
Did you make a dreamspark thing through UNR?
yep
Well, you need to be able to sign in
lol
Requires a separate account created by your school administrator. If you do not have an account, you will be able to request one through the WebStore .
huh
well I requested one
you did that?
er
wrong link
sec
hmm
I verified it with my school email
that should be fine
there's a thing to click if you forgot your username/password
i'm logged in on that dreamspark website
but win7 isnt there
you have to go to the "more stuff from your university"
You have to do it though the university page
yes
right
and when I go there my account isn't registered
Yeah, I think that is a different account
When I registered for this stuff, it was before we had .edu emails
so it was a different process for me
but I use my old pre-.edu account info at the UNR dreamspark page
"Your username for registering on UNR's DreamSpark site is your last name (Case sensitive - Capitalize first letter) and the last 4 digits of your NSHE ID # (example: Smith1234).If you are not able to register, please e-mail your full name and NetID to eccadmins@engr.unr.edu.
Click here to reach UNR's Dreamspark.
(Dreamspark accounts are only valid for one year and expire every August. You must re-register at the beginning of every academic year.)"
from the ECC webpage
ayyyy
it worked
now downloading 64bit win7
also, no crashes so far
just haven't used twitch, that's the only difference
yeah, downloading anything from dreamspark is a pain in the ass
i ended up torrenting windows and just using the product key
friggin secure downloader lol
the secure downloader is total crap
A few months ago when I was installing Windows on my desktop, it was totally unusable
It wouldn't even run
weird
it seems to work fine for me
I tried using it two days ago, it worked, sorta
I couldn't get it to associate with the download file
o.O
odd
Took some fiddling to get it to start the download
Then, the thing it downloaded wouldnt install
So I was like "fuck it, i'll stick with google docs"
lol
oh yeah I can get office and stuff from this too huh
office  supposedly
it is such a lie
it will not install! no matter what!
lol
well, i am going to go to bed now
good night
night
dangit tony
I read this "Nordstrom is just the latest employer to give walking papers to what an employee posted on Facebook" and my first thought was "Walking papers? That's quite a feat! ba-dum psh"
lol
hey brandelonian, at some point before I leave (so tonight or tomorrow) would you mind helping me wipe my drives? pc crashes after about 10 minutes now and it's time for a fresh install I think
did you get the win 7 iso?
yeah, it's on my flash drive along with my textbooks, so once I move those somewhere it'll be good to load
just google how to install windows from a flashdrive
it'll give you the option to clear the drives during install;
oh really?
ok
any chance if I have a virus it's latched onto the usb?
nah
the usb can;t have other stuff on it though
just the iso
yeah
and you probably need to do something special to the usb
yeah you do
o/
\o
watsup
finished my software engineering final
was pretty easy
just natwurking left
woo
when is natwurking?
that's thursday?
wednesday at 12:30
gross
so early
i'd rather it be early than late
yeah my 5pm final tonight is really lame
early being some time after noon but before 2
lol
oh hey, my final is then too
hey brandon, how many chrome *32 processes do you have?
really?
yes
huh
well I have 5 and thought that was odd
i have 6 tabs open though
i have 1
and a few plugins
"Papa, ken I hheff 5 rubles for to buy milk and bread and vudka?"
"What? 20 rubles? what do you need 50 rubles for?"
every plugin and tab runs on its own process
wtf was that tony
lol
reverse jewish joke
aha
do you still have your bootloader usb brandon? (just in case mine fails)
nein
damen
i think it's doing ubuntu these days
gotcha
but if all else fails and I brick this stuff, I could download win7 from somewhere and just use my product key to activate, yeah?
yes
gotcha
no it was a joke about how the Ruble is falling
like
atrociously
100 rubles is worth 1 euro now
rubles is russia money
yes but it is the exact opposite of the jewish joke
well then, I will attempt installing win7 when i come home from my final
is it?!
yes
what's teh jewish joke?
kid asks jewish dad for $50. "$20? what do you need $5 for?"
XD i like that better
lol
1600 word note sheet for networking
surely that will be enough to get me a decent grade
lol
You ever rotate your shoulder wrong and it does like 3 rotation axes for one movement
and it hurts like hell?
o_O
3 rotation axes
shoulders only have two degrees of freedom, so no
lol
well you know what i mean yes?
sorry, roll/pitch/yaw
not quite
oh
you've never moved a ball and socket joint and have it not go smooth?
no
weird
sometimes my elbow gets weird to where I know if I make my arm straight, it will pop and hurt
So, I may work for Sushil again next semester
but I won't be doing lab work so hopefully he won't be as annoying to work for
also google speech to text knew how to transcribe "sushil"
Guess who never has to write another paper?
yur mum
can't be you
you're literally always writing a paper
Today I am done my degree :D
nope, you're just starting the next chapter in your life long essay
AWESOME
how does post grad life work in Canada?
I will beat you up for trying to ruin my no paper glow ^-^
holy hell
post-grad life in canada works by writing papers
You'll never have another "can't, writing a paper"
I have to wait until march to actually graduate officially
ah
and then 2 months after that before they mail you your degree
But I can get a letter saying ive done all the work
lol everyone's on league because of that snowdown game
awesome
nah two month after I get it handed to me at convocation cause there is noooo way my daddy is missing that
oh nice
My dad is happier than I am I think
My mom is far more excited for me to graduate than I am
I would have gladly foregone college and just started working if I had the opportunity
nowadays college is just....
i don't even know
not training
it's a networking incubator
basically
yup
a very expensive networking incubator
where you only want like 25% of the networking
featuring group projects such as "fuck you I'm not doing it" and the lyrical stylings of "yes it's tedious but this is academia"
jews
you see that ruble joke ian?
wat
reverse jewish joke
regarding teh russian economy
"papa can I have 5 rubles for milk and bread and vudka?"
"What? 20 rubles? What you need 50 rubles for?"
lol
this 3 meat pizza looks suspiciously like a 2 meat pizza
Tony, wasn't there an annoying person named Ergo or something similar in T2?
yeah
I just watched an episode of SG1 about an annoying guy named Urgo
hahah oh wow
hi folks
hi

so
this iso does not work
whats it do?
tried installing, it gives me a "missing cd/dvd driver" error
went to windows support, cause is bad iso
i see
yeah
gonna try redownloading the iso
I'm double checking to see if i have a flashdrive set up with the iso
so, I can't redownload the 64x windows iso now
it won't let me
torrent it
that's what I did
why the hell do I have 3 ubuntu install drives
nevermind... four
yeah, no tengo windows drive
ok
i guess my laptop should still have the iso though
would you mind torrenting it for me? my computer won't live long enough to do it and alex's doesnt have torrenting set up
i'm expecting a crash in a few minutes
or if you already have it that'd be even better
craptop is slow, hold on
lol
yeah, I have the iso on here still
awesome
Want me to just come over?
mouse is starting to flicker, gonna crash soon
umm
in like 15 minutes?
k, text me when
sounds good
shutting down preemptively :(
wat do
drank more apple cider
drank
get yer drank on
k
...maybe i should redesign my website
you could
how do i get people to email me more
make the email button bigger
there is no email button
you have to copy/paset
well, there's a good place to start, then
I don't really want to redesign it though...
-_-
but it's good experience
i redesigned my website all the time
i will be doing quite a bit of web design over break, actually
gotta make my senior project look good and have good action sequences
lol
how do i make it so it's nice and simple without making a form?
like...
if spam bots get ahold of it then my mail forwarding could be blocked
use a captcha or just use a mailto link
mailto
ok
that never works for me though lol
same
everyone hates mailto links
hahah
so why would I do that D:
because it's marginally better than nothing? :D
lol ok
i'd rather just copy/paste
you could make it auto copy it when you click it
that'd be cool
You could jump on the whole single page website trend
but i hate that so much
wait
lol
i have only one page
lol
they arent that bad
as long as they make sense, i dont mind them
i need to think of like...goals for the site
there's a hole in the middle of your masonry grid for me
yah
that's how they align with the order :<
why would it not just put the last image in that spot?
no idea
lol wow, they scrapped The Interview?
yeah
a lot of insanity is being raised by NK
lol
people are suggesting they make it a digital download
imagine if a seth rogen/james franco movie was the thing that caused the end of the world by nuclear war
looks like Android is ready for me to head over
afkish
lol oy
yeah
North Korea should just die
lol
the whole country
yeh
well
meh
well, doctors
Doktor
it appears Andrew's computer has departed from the world of the living
Herr Doktor Brandon, why has this occured?
SSD death
What a sad death
indeed
It will likely be missed until a suitable replacement is found
yep
Brandon
hi
The thing that goes under a tea cup is called a tea cup plate
yes?
or a saucer
umm
Its a tea cup plate
i'd say a saucer
Its called a saucer!
Courtney is actually a jew
tea cup plate is far too specific and too much to say
and she's lying to you
Okay its just a plate then
Just admit you forgot what its called!
lol
You jews
How's Channika?
apparently cup plate is a thing
called it
$1 please
Go read
its for the american market
sucka
pft
the saucer article does have it being shown under a cup of tea
your market sucks
Seeeeee
it also says if you read the paragraph
You're just a tea hating jew
my ruling: both are right!
so, $1 from each of you please
BOO
Courtney will pay
cause I own her soul
boo
That's confirmation of payment
Why wouldn't you foolish americans just call it by its actual name D:
i call it a saucer
good lol
Why can't Canadians say "Bag"
flag
dragon
sag
house
nag
lag
drag
oh and yeah and house
sorry
^
wat
wat
you guys say sorry way wrong
like your not even sore
>.>
lol
yeah hey
Ian claims I have a thick Canadian accent
I disagree
we'll have to take a vote when you're in Vegas
Im not paying any dollars xD
Maybe I will bring loonies though
lol
wut
I dun'no aboot that hey?
You have an accent bub
who says bub?
its buddy guy
I'm not your guy, pal
im not your pal, friend
no
so wrong
Eh?
sooo Braindon, hoos aboot them maple leaves ockey players?
ugh
lol
I saw a moose in my froont lawn yesterday before gooin to geet a bag o' milk at timmies'
I asked my friends megan to find me a moose toque for christmas
not a parka
whatever that is
That's a beanie
Toque
Yur mum's a toque
Torque
You face needs a Toque
You need a job
You need an education
Oh? I am acquiring a science degree
Please
Tell me what does your degree offer?
I dont remember what your major is, Ian
CS
lol
ohhhhh like I havnt heard that one before
lol
Courtney has a degree in "Does this towel come in white?"
Do you guys ever get to tobaggen?
She has a degree in writing papers
that hurt Ian
I don't work with towels
But do towels work with you?
Thank you Brandon xD
You'll work with towel-heads in civil service
Allah akbar
what is a towel head?
no make the sence
no make engrish
Du sprecht Englisch?
towel head
I don't work with wet hair either
O.o
wierdos
im not weird
Ian is weird
I'm not weird
Brandon is weird
Prove it
Okay
Ian has hummingbirds. That makes him cooler than cat owners
Without mentioning blended taquitos
^
I said WITHOUT!
xD
Litterally ruined my paragraph
lol
you eat blendedtaquitos???
ewwwwww
Besides, that isn't me being weird, that is me redefining the norm
"Do you enjoy turning solid foods into liquids"
ewwwwwww
I use it as a dip for my other taquitos
i dont just drink it
lol
seems uneccesary
Andrew has tried it too, and has confirmed that it is good
just get sour cream
blend it with some cheese and salsa
or mayonnaise
yum
mayo... on a taquito...?
dafuq?
mayo on everything
duh
that's disgusting
nuh uh
i dont even put mayo on sandwiches
ketchup is disgusting
and mustard
filthy French and their filthy dijon
ketchup is fine, mustard is meh
mayo :D
mayo is gross
mayo on poutine is meh
mayo on everything else though
mayo on ice cream? mayo on candy? mayo on some pepsi?
yuck
how would you put mayo on pepsi?
pepsi is gross
just plop it in
and depends on the candy
and ice cream doesn't need anything extra
except chocolate
dont tell me you would seriously consider mayo on candy?
that's just absurd
depends on the candy
im not tottaly opposed to the idea
What candy could possible be good with mayo?
chewy ones?
That's a trick question, because mayo is never good with anything
there better be mayo in vegas :(
or I will be unhappy
lol
Vegas banned mayo
WHAT
in the  mayo bill
liar
wheres my mayo at
and my money >.>
slut
the mayo sank
on may 5th
wat
yeah, mexico was so glad to hear about it that they made a holiday about it
cinco de mayo
pffft
lol assuming I don't know about Mexican holidays
Mexico is the number one destination for Canadian vacationers
90% of my friends have gone there
and not even seen the pyramids what a waste of time and money eh?
But have you?
I have gone to Mexico, I am basically an expert
I don't need to go there to know about their celebrations
My sister loves going to mexico and cuba like a wierdo
but I do respect her communist ways
lol
But anyways, yeah. Blended taquitos dont make me weird
(yes they do)
So, Ian. I am waiting for you to prove that I am weird
I think he went downstairs
Do you guys get Pika?
those little mouse things?
You're sort of close to the Rockies aren't you?
Yeah
Never seen one in person
that go AHHHH AHHH AHHH AHHH
so do monkeys
I have, I want one
Monkies throw poop
no comparison
this is true
Pika don't like dried pineapples by the way
lol
Pika are rodents
rodents are disgusting
Nuh uh
Rodents are the cutest
I had a hamster once
It died
Black plague
A very tragic death
What did you do?
It was running on its wheel when the wheel came unhinged
it broke its leg
and bled out
HAPPY HOLIDAYS!
lolol
HAPPY HOLIDAYS
Except you, jews
I
hate
the
cold
and work
I hate those things too
Yes, cold is bad
Andrew says he can do 6 for sure
So, are we all good with Ricardo's at 6 pm tomorrow?
Sure
6pm
Ricardos

lobb
y

I will need you to drive me toby
Tony
Lol
lol
So who all will be there?
Just us four?
that's fine nao
Just us, I think
Bad news guys
My parents just ate a Ricardos
looks like Don't Starve has official multiplayer support now
lol
literally the only game I wanted the xbox for was mass effect 3
since I never finished it
and the xbox in california refused to play it anymore
gonna get medicated and sleep
o/
tah
\o
adios
we should all play LoL at some point
or some multiplayer game
i miss multiplayer gaming
lol
I'm on my laptop though
on ubuntu
without a headset
lol
well then you could probably play minecraft and have moderate success!
I've been feeling the Minecraft itch lately actually
me4
not right now though lol
just a tiny bit though
yeah
me either
imma go to bed and play some hearthstone
lame
nowaymayne
hearthstone is mah thang
yeswaymayne
i'm legitimately good at something
lol
well fuck
windows update wants to do things when i shut down
lol
it isnt the normal thing that ruins it, as far as I can tell
only one update, normally like 20
hi folks
hi
what's up
nmu
board
w2play game
well that update broke my computer again
great
also someone made 200 dollars of purchases on origin with my card
O.O
yeah
so
great day so far
lol
brandon why the fuck is my computer breaking
fix itttttt
-_- is this not the first time that's happened?
no clue
just disable windows update i guess
no, i've completely reinstalled windows 6 times now in an attempt to fix this
MSE + Malware Bytes?
it's windows update that's breaking his computer
dafuq
Update for Internet Explorer 11 for Windows 7 for x64-based Systems (KB300)

Help and Support: 
THIS IS THE FUCKING UPDATE
ARE YOU SHITTING ME
lol
i don't even think i can uninstall that update
there is literally no way for me to fix this other than completely reinstalling windows and waiting for it to happen again
try that stuff?
tried a lot of that, but there are a few things like an offline system restore that could help
thanks
well, both of my drives check out
so if there's a hardware problem it's elsewhere
that's not good
i doubt it's hardware
tried sfc /scannow?
yeah
no problems
tried doing a repair rather than a full reinstall of windows?
not yet
I will though
it functions well enough to use temporarily and I need to get this business with origin sorted first
I thought this guy on SG1 was familiar
he played Todd on Atlantis
oh no way
lol
and Big Foot on Sanctuary
i liked Todd
ran another scf /scannow and still no issues (not surprising)
running malwarebytes now, though that will almost definitely come up empty as well
yeah there's no way that will fix it
I figured out how to uninstall that update
and I did
I also undid the automatically install updates option
so i'm gonna restart in a second and see if that fixes anything
o_O same guy also played Teyla's husband
in Atlantis
odd
well, system restoring to before that point didnt work this time
so i'm literally out of ideas
when i went to repair my computer, it had the wrong drive letter for my installation of windows
it said it was E: local disc rather than C:
E: is the removable drive that I have the windows installer on
o.o
would that like...be a big issue?
no clue
whelp, computer seems to be fixed for now, installed a bunch of driver updates and while it was restarting for those it just kinda fixed itself (probably because of the system restore, but it just took an extra restart)
hey bran/tony, either of you know stuff about PHP?
my cousin's best friend needs some kind of help with some kind of PHP
lol
well, I've used PHP a little bit
lol
that's more than me
would you mind skyping her and seeing if you can help?
I don't have a good mic, just craptop mic
you should find out what exactly the question is first
awkward, I was watching SG1 and it was a scene where a scientist was imaging two women fighting over him, while making sexual sounds. Right as my dad walks by my door
lol
khehehe
that always happens
the one sex scene in any film
will happen when a parent is walking by
lol

hi, ignore this: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=129&p=1983#post1983
just pasting for my own reference in a minute
it's only ubunu?
It was ubuntu and windows until we replaced our modem
Changing the MTU seemed to fix it for Ubuntu too
huh
you know, now that I think about it, I remember learning about MTU in my networking class
hi
hi
I am considering buying Arma 3
should I?
It is pretty good
The physics are 100x better than arma ii
I would hope so, lol
doesn't arma iii have dayz?
dunno
Most people either play arma II dayz or standalone dayz
arma 3 has some cool looking game modes/mods though
Arma III does have dayz
I don't play it though
uhhhh
ok calling all IT peeps
what on earth
o/ yo is flushing the DNS a good idea?
PICKUP DA PHONE
hi
i was in the shower
ahah
well
any thoughts as to the shenanigans up there?
does your internet work?
yeah
flushing dns iddn't resolve the issue
then dont worry about it
lol
but i can't connect ot the league of legends store
DNS is dynamic and self configuring
brb
just try restarting shit tony, it'll probably fix itself
lol i did
also flushed dns
nuthin
maybe they're having issues
eh doubtful
sometimes it'll show up but then die
OOOH
oh snap

including league
i want spam musubi
i just had pizza

lol
mystery skins will mystery skin
any ashe skin would have been preferrable
eew ashe
I really should have brought my headset with me
you should have
i have a shitty mic nao
the one tom gave me
do your in ear monitors have a mic?
Skype/mumble/ts?
well so do I
probably mumb
mumble fosho
I have my built in laptop mic
or skype depending on andrew's cert
need to download
I can make a new cert, gotta redownload as well though
I'd have to download league >_<
it doesnt take that long, only took me about 20 mins
believe me
I did it six times
lol
lol
So, tony, that network analysis tool thing you linked earlier
that would have been SO helpful to me like.. a week ago
lol i know
or three weeks ago really
i just found out about it from Riot Support
I just ran it, and it checks MTU settings
myth confirmed?
I already knew it was fixed, but knowing to look at MTU specifically three weeks ago would have helped. lol
restarting computer, brb
brbpizza
jurk
im in mumble now
hi
thin crust tostada pizza doesnt rewarm too well
brb restarting to windows
lol
ugh, how does one get priveleges to do crap in mumble again?
ap halp
ohai
right click your name
press register
ezpz
you know spending an extra $10-20 for a mic on my IEMs would have been a good idea
iems?
in ear monitors
you guys getting on?
it was only that much extra? lol
yeah, it wasn't much more lol
I figured I never would use it though
true
just use push to talk and your shitty laptop mic
it'll only murder us when you talk
lol yeah
League is still installing for now
so we'll gain a pavlovian response to your voice that makes us cringe
lol
you mean you haven't already?!
lol not quite
but that french accent, man!
I think something about this chat makes me salivate though
oh wait you werent there for that
holdup
k, launcher is installed and downloading the game
o/ chat off for now
(☞ﾟヮﾟ)☞
where do i set my push to talk key?
in the settings menu
i dont see the option anywhere
settings, audio input, under transmit change that to push to talk
then apply
yeah, but where do I set the key i press?
pretty sure you go to shortcuts for that
but I could be wrong
got it
yeah, shortcuts, add, push to talk, choose key
cool
is ctrl used in league?
i dont remember
nothing as far as we can remember
k, gonna join, pardon any microphone explosions
is the naosyth ready?
download failed
restarted it
now it's stuck again
ohboy
download is resuming
90%
the download seems to stop but doesn't a lot of the times
just let it do its thing
gg folks :D
yehhhhhh didnt go so well for me
it wasn't a bad game
i got absolutely shrekked
the akali/fiddle combo knocked us
i kept getting taken by akali
should've stunnede fiddle more
yeah and alistair just kinda walked in whenever he felt like it and knocked us all around a bit
he was out of position a lot
if we focused him we could've killed him but we're not at full team dynamic lol
at least that's my take on it
m31 would probably have more valuable advice
ignore alistar
0 damage, just focus on the squishes
ahah
At the terminal. Quietest place in las vegas right here
ahahaha
I'll send you the taxi bill
Lolol ok
That will be all your money
I'll take your card information when you are ready

Ian
Courtney Boyle
holy shit
that would be terrifying
did her harness come undone or something?
another day, another non-broken computer :D
woo
nao
remember that you need to acquire mittens
and i need to cut bolts
although probably sometime later
acquire mittens, disregard locked objects
got it
yeh
lol
how did you make "later" bold? o_O
underscores make it italic
_test_
must be a function of the ugly version of skype
probably
it really is ugly
asterisks
*test*
nop
aha
nice
*no thanks i'll keep non-ugly skype*
it'll force you to update anyways
he's not the lord of death
it hasn't yet
he's lord of turtles
lol not if he's a genius
no i'm the lord of death
T.I.M.
oh yeah
you're already on my level
lol
so
when do you mean by *later*
?
in what context
when did i say later
<<< 
...
full context please?
you have a mouse wheel don't you?
yeh
scroll up
naw
there's this thing called chat history
it's really neat
by later i probably meant not now
so today or what?
probably not
still sickish
but i should be on the last few legs
OH bolt cutting and mitten swapping
yeah not today
most likely wednesday
should be healed up
ok, it'll have to be before 5-6ish
that's fine
dinner plans i imagine?
yeah
although my dad doesn't always get home before 5
lol whenever
also Jayne from Firefly was in SG1 apparently
everyone was in everything i'm finding out
at least
if you were in space
everyone was apparently on SG1
then you were also probably in space
folks want to league?
or something?
maybe not starve?
i dont have not starving :(
could league after this war thunder match
okey dok :D
nao did you wanna join
nah
k
pew pew lazurz
pew pew 7.7 tracers
ohai
hola
hola
hola
minecraft is running
might have to join in a while, cant atm :F
okay
so apparently the people who made Space Engineers are also making Medieval Engineers
. . .
wat
i
i dont' know
how to feela bout htis
it looks like it'd be fun to do castle wars
terrain mapping....
wowzers
trebucet
dig it
that looks pretty interesting
i feel like it could have some issues with actually being enjoyable without massive multiplayer and cool combat mechanics though
yeah it'd definitely need good combat mechanics
it would probably be better for faction-like battles than MC though
yeah definitely
with the right combat mechanics anyway
and an ability to make yourself totally overpowered
gotta have that for us to play
oh and no lag would be nice
T_T
todays dose of venom was brought to you by the letters LOL
LOL
Medieval Engineers sounds more fun than space
nao tomorrow still good for cutting bolts?
Is anyone up for minecraft this evening?
maybe
possibree
either that or a night with the gf since i'm heading to california for some minor surgery (removing my stupid [wisdom] teeth)
o.o
oh wow
luck to ya
lol
thanks
the top two are playing nice
the bottom two are making a beeline for each other, and my other teeth are in the way
gta for pc looks pretty sweet
am impressed by recommended pc specs as well
master race needed
FTB server is up for anyone who is interested
workingo n things D:
hi
anyone know who jazzy.boo30 is
randomly messaged me on skype
nope
also tony: yes, before 6
maybe its a youtube fan
oh dear god no
don't want?
I get those kind of invites every once in a while, they're just trollbots trying to get you to sign up for something and get your info
eww
yep
most of the time its: "hey sexy, want to have some one on one time with me? link to my camera: OBVIOUSTROLLING.ORG/JASMINE"
ewwwww
x.x
indeed
yeah, this one just said "are you still online?"
so andrew, think you can pick me up from the airport Sunday?
at like 10 or 11 pm, i dont remember exactly
don't forget to bring it
i wont
ty
tony: dont forget to bring it tomorrow
xD
i can probably pick you up then, yeah. not entirely sure if i'll be back by then or not, depends on how hardcore of drugs i'm on at that point after i get my teeth removed, but i'm planning on driving back on saturday so yeah
if everything works as planned, i can get you
ok, lemme know
whelp, i think we've successfully pinged down the issue with my pc. did some windows updates (not including that IE one) and it's still fine
made plenty of restore points just in case
but yeah
i'll bring it
nao when was a good time?
"bfore 6" i know but anything more preferred?
whenever my dad gets home I guess
cool let me know
i shall
apparently Take it to the Bank (I forgot his name) isn't teaching CS 219 next semester, Andrew
Some dude named Arslan Munir is instead
lg2m shipit?
lgtm*
but idk
he's new
and sounds like he will have an accent
of course Egbert (the old guy, i remembered his name) wasn't great either
tony
(tony)
aka tony
your rapper name is now "AKA Tony" tony
no longer judge hyb?
shame
what's up
My dad isn't home yet, but I just remembered that he's been at work since 2 am, so he may want to sleep when he gets home lol
ahah
thursday ok then?
probably
ok
Tuesthurday
yeah
I asked Shannon's German exchange student if she had ever had schwip schwap
she had, and seemed very confused by my question
she said it was basically an off-brand not so great soda that you get when Fanta or Coke arent an option
nein nein nein nein nein nein nein!!!!!
ja ja ja ja ja ja ja!!!!!
NEIN!
JA!
meh
that's hilairous
lol
also
bolt cutting today?
plz?
yes
ok
and you shall receive
them
I'm going to dinner with my parents tonight, but otherwise I'm not doing anything
ok
do you want to hang out at all before bolt cutting?
we can, what did you want to do?
hmm
idk lol
i could bring my laptop to your place and we could attempt to not starve maybe
or just smash or other wii game
sounds good
i should probably eat lol
i am eating too
and then showering/stuff
o/
o/
ready?
sec
lemme see if my clothes are ready to put in the dryer yet
just got part of the rinse and spin cycles left to finish :F
hokay
can we starve together with the first game?
probably
i thought that was it's own separate game?
wait, what are you asking? lol
Is multiplayer an option in starve together?
or is that exclusive to teh sequel game?
starve together is the multiplayer
i meant in don't starve
it's a free update or dlc
the multiplayer
oooooh hey
would it be easier to just mumble for this? lol
on't Starve Together is a standalone multiplayer expansion of the uncompromising survival game, Don't Starve. NOTE: Players who currently own Don't Starve on Steam will get Don't Starve Together for free when it exits Early-Access.
it would but i thought you didn't havea  viable mic?
well, apparently it wasnt terrible when we did LoL?
you didn't game with us
My laptop mic is usually incomprehensible
yes I did
lol
??
I did a round of ARAM with you
was it an aram?
roit
yeah i didn't hear you lol
x_x
but i said stuff
and you said stuff
maybe i just don't remember
I just dont feel like moving my laptop/charger/mouse/keyboard lol
hokay
we can test out mumble real quack
sure
you guys have the new smash bros for wii u? if so we should totally do some games :3
I do not own a WiiU
Me neither :(
Its cause you're short
so...you're also short?
No I don't own one cause I have a desktop PC
totally different reasons
Minecraft is running, for those interested
what do
courtbille and i are minecrafting on my server
everyone else?
dunno
You are welcome to play, if you'd like
nao's got his dinner thing
oh right
whoa
relevant
TT_TT
so much death
makes sense though
triggers your nose's "this will literally kill me" sense
My timmies is right beside there, and I am legit concerned I might have to go out of my way to get it for a while now.
- Explains why I felt so sick eating it too. My body must of been like "whoa whoa whoa go vomit that up wth is wrong with you"
Yuup
It's probably another high-school gang incident
Stupid kids being litteral shits
Honestly Im just glad they didn't hit the gas tanks.
Also, Target is pulling out of Canada
-_-
yeah i heard that, why?
Distribution issues
Target's here are so empty all the time
...heh
Also they are all set up differently, the ones you guys had that I saw are so clean looking, and so full and exciting. But the ones here aren't like that at all. Boring and dirty and the products they did send up sucked in comparison
so like
K Mart
I don't know what that is xD
uhhh
like
your target
slowly dying breed
thigns piled up
no sense made
O.o
usually in lesser areas of town
ok
so like ... Walmart, kmart, target?
ish
yeah
stores
they tried a price war with walmart once
lost horribly
lol bad idea
Did you get Cecil's it to Brandoni in time?
yeah
Cecil will receive it if Brandoni delivers it
Brandoni sounds like a bad Italian dish
The Great Brandini
howzat
haha dat^
Much better
i forget if i had like a weird corruption of his name
I was also Tonesta the sleepy version
If The Great Brandini, fails, then we will take away The Great
Brandini the average
Yes!
orite
"Bran Man"
yeah he hates that
Brandini the average Bran Man
sounds like a terrible cereal
haha
The Great Brandini Bran Man
Hi
"Bran Man Brand Cereal!" Manufactured by Brandoni Grains
Ian has his server up again! :D
wat
wat
Did the Brandini remember it?
I have it
I'm not flying back until Sunnight though
Ok :)
Don't forget it
I shant
Or do
you know
>.>
She's not your boss
She is though
I am!
wut
Courtney I am your boss
No
I own your soul
no arguing
Doesn't make you my boss
I'm afraid it does
And doesn't mean I cant argue
Once I gave it to Andrew, you'll be his boss instead
All of your bosses then? o.o
I am still your boss
no, it's just that one ϛϛϛ΁
it's special
oh good
lol
Cecil, where's my money??
i had to censor that word
could give it away
good catch
this looks like a really cool game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFKMeq-x-ZM
you can skip to like 12 minutes to see some interesting gameplay
ok that is kinda cool
ja
fucking A
If you recieve an email with NOTHING in the field

alex is trying to find her canadian olympics hat so we can match :P
brandon we should play some ftb when deco puts the server up, I covered our mountaintop in grass so it looks much prettier
I want to see that :P
well it's not quite done
but you could come visit
lol
I think I've seen all of the other bases, but not yours o.o
its very... sparse
lol
mine's nonexistent
unexceptebre
i dont' ftb too well
warum?
Its ok, if were too successful we could cut into deco's profit margins and he can break the rules and nuke us with fewer consequences
hi
hi seems like a very good response to "nuke us with fewer consequences"
lol
yes lol
doctors don't need no nukes
we invented the nuke
lol
I don't even have FTB on my desktop
unexcepetbre
indeed
ftb needed
Fine, I installed it
GOOD
GOOD
DOOG
DOGO
Your prize is a lifetime supply of drumroll

dudududududuududududuududududud
PSHHHHH
Now you can help me with bees >: D
I kinda want to play some BF4
havent done that in a while
yo
i'm down for that
the bf4
not bees
never bees
i'll probably have to update my bf4
I was just kidding about the bees lol
oh god updates :<
bees are horribad
lol yes, updates
lemme go ahead and update origin
yeah i'd have to download origin, bf4, all the dlc's, and all the updates
so im just gonna play LoL or something
lol
o/ I'm down
lol no i didnt want to steal you from brandon
here, i'll play war thunder :P
...brandon has lol
yeah but he wanted to bf4
actually i'm just watching youtube for now lol
go play whatever
@_@
simcity  se available
fo free
may as well update uplay
im just sitting here eating some jello :P
do peepl want to do some low stress lolligaggin?
i do :I
well i'm online
ame
aram?
if that's what you want to do
lol
did you want to risk 5s?
we'll most likely get beaten down
in front of some toxic players
but you'l learn a lot fast
lets just do aram, likely i won't get a spot with ashe and she's the only champ i'm even remotely comfortable with
Hi
Hello
I just got home from work
Ian's gonna put up the server :D
FTB is running for any interested parties
I'll hop on in a little bit
what was the IP again?
72.193.109.49
gracias
de nada
peeps should mumble
i'm hopping on the server
i will once my pot pie finishes cooking
but I h8 mumble
but y
I hate push to talk
#1 better than skype
i don't use p2t
mumble has non push to talk
yeah
I know
but it picks up my backround then
it has quite nice voice detection if you set it up correctly
you can adjust it
I don't haz mumble
I know
just run the wizard and try it out
courtney its free :D
mehhhhhh but im lazzzy
GoonHaven mumble requires special config
nope
all you have to do is right click your name and select register
once you log onto the server
which is as simple as typing in mumble.gamerhaus.org
Plus teamspeak is better
but we don't use ts
i know
mumble is nice
mumble is nice
mumble is meh
i need the updated config files for my desktop
(anyone feel like sending it to me?)
Ohhhhh
Right
lol, lemme find it
gotcha
unless deco has it available
nope
lol
for sure don't
goes in the powerconverters folder
I have no clue where it downloaded that to x_x
stupid skype updated
[Your FTB Directory]\FTB Tech World 2\config\powerconverters
is where it goes
what you guys wrk on?
"those things you designed look good Anthony"
"Why thank you client."
"But my mother has a proposition for you"
lol really?
lol yes
so
like
uh
she hasn't contacted me
so
dunno how this is gonna go
woah, somebody's mom is a cougar
prowlin around on lil tony
peeps still ftbing?
pft
will be in a bit, skyping gf
gotcha
i'll probably hop on in like 20 or so
and tony i'm assuming that was a business proposition, rather than a female-male proposition
if so, gratz if it works out
yes it was
but
uh
i dunno
if the MOMs design choices
are gonna be prime
gotcha
or what her proposition is
because
i FINISHED my prototype
like
today
if that's approved
i just need to order, print, produce, and voila
get paid
suddenly
mom has an idea
interesting
have you read the oatmeal andrew?
mostly just snippets i see on reddit
this is something branman and I read before we got into college for our respective majors
like before he designed for that apple grill guy
lol that seems like a fairly accurate and funny series of thoughts put onto a webpage
sounds like oatmeal
hi
still on ftb andrew?
just hopped back on
afkish though, eating mac and cheese
i'll get on mumble after that
donde esta nao?
hi
was skyping my mom
aha
gf
mom
you and your skyping
popular guy
lol
it was weird skyping shannon
how so
Well, we talked for a bit, then we ran out of stuff to say and it got awkward lol
that always happens
it's good to have some kind of breakaway thing prepared so if it starts running dry on convo you can just say "hey, gotta go" and it's not awkward, and neither of you really care that you're going because the conversation ran dry anyway
yeah
I was like "I should go eat"
lol
lol
but it was still weird because I didn't really want to end the call
used that one quite a few times
lol
yeah, you don't WANT to, but really it's healthier for the relationship if you do
that way you don't notice things getting awkward
yeah, well it was our first time skyping so I guess it went alright lol
cool
I can just give you some eggs brandini no worries :P
if you do so, I will repay you when I become rich and powerful
deal lol
where you at?
my base
donde?
which is all the way by decos
:/
oh i was just there
lol
oh lol
head back ill meet you there?
xD
sure
oh
frame a picture of her
so you can still look at her
for the call?
well
i imagine you like looking at her
hence the skype linger
but also
well skype is a video call
lol
swing it around to the picture of her one day
video silence may as well be a .gif
i don't recommend framing a .gif
she'll be like AWW
and stuff
mhmm
lol
.gif
ending conversations should be easier
at least i imagine
skyping is just different, takes getting used to I guess
ffffffffffffffuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
?
bypassed my old router

"fun" meaning it could be fun, it could be a pain in the ass
I am kinda tempted to take it, but I really have no reason to do so
and I fear taking it and it being a pain in the ass
you should just to hang with me :P
lol

oh yeah, and you start on a tree on a 1x1 piece of dirt
hah ok that's kinda cool
Ian's actually been hosting MC as well
I might join that :) is it running on the 1.7 base?
Interesting how it's kinda coming back
iiiiiii am not sure
I actually haven't been playing ><
ok, does it have applied energistics or applied energistics 2?
oic
yeah i'm lame
been doing league
and mini steam stuff
nothing wrong with that
lol'
Hi
server is up
what pack/how join?
Tech world 2
you need a config from me
after agreeing to the rules
o.O?
IT HAS ROTARYCRAFTASDFSDFASDFASDF <3
yes
Want to hear the rules
yes
1.
No tesseracts
2. Don't be a dick
rule 1 is ghey
3. You must live 300m from any base
lol
4, no myscraft
That's about it
amen
Do you agree to these terms
I hate mystcraft anyway
yes
enderchests can tide my tesseract needs anyway
You need that
there's only the vanilla ender chest
oh?
crap
so no piping items
hmm
yeah :(
That config goes
there's probably some alternative way of teleporting items
[You FTB directory]\FTB Tech World 2\config\powerconverters
ip?
72.193.109.49
so everyone can rest assured that I will be using and abusing rotarycraft and eventually reactorcraft
sure
I'm abusing everything
brandon and I are just getting into rotarycraft
it looked like fun
I'm making a larger quarry, Andrew
I have a gravel gun and have killed almost everyone on the server at least once by accident
yayy
i'm hopping on
mumble?
mumble?
yes
lol
yes
lol
deco

hi
hi
Courtney Boyle
Courtney Boyle
sorry
lol
yo brandog, still awake?
minecraft is up
hooray for random crashes
hooray
So, Sushil decided last minute that he didn't want me to grade for CS 381, and then a few hours later another professor asked me to grade for CS 326 :D
lol
who's doing 326 now?
mirceau
*mircea
lol i couldnt remember if it had a u or not
lol
why'd sushil decide not to have you grade?
dunno
weird
maybe he remembered me and was like "that's a bad idea"
I did sit in the front because I was like the last one there and it was open
lol
"leave the server up"
well I did
its empty
lol
meister went to work
lol
and i got bored being all alone
oh
hi
server still up?
It can be
want it
nah, was just wondering
i'd just be there to chat lol
oh lol
I took it down for the evening due to limited interest
>in chat client
>loading up server to chat
although I can understand wanting a different scenery
that's basically was T2 was for years
interactive 3d chat room
lol pretty much
stand on the highest place
and chat
yup
I swear, whoever lives above me is just hammeing on their floor and walls for no reason
I can feel the impacts making my desk vibrate
I am going to get my hammer and try to communicate with them
lol
They don't seem to be responsive to my hammer noises
try morse?
all I know is SOS
scumbag charter
says they doubled my internet speed
now i can't even download a file and browse the web at the same time
o.o
wow
sup
I ordered a TrackIR 5
hoi ian :)
bored
yup
gonna watch an episode of family guy, hopefully hes back before im done
Deco & Sons
herro decosun
hi
sup
hi
hi
server going up today?
probably
Let me see how many other people are interested
kk
hi
hi
is decosine hosting? :D
done know
nope
decooooooo where be you? :(
if you draw a circle of swastikas and say "decosun" three times in the dark, he will appear
lol
you have to draw them with lamb's blood though
crap
no sheep here
hi
o/
o/
o/
how's y'all's days goin'?
bored
me4
getting hw done so I can relax later
got my stitches out and I can now eat all solid foods :D so happy
about to eat leftover amazing chinese food
are we still doing game night some time, andrew?
oh yeah
um
lol
i'll talk to alex
not tonight for sure
but if you wanted to hang and do some smash or something we could bring the wii over or hook it up to the tv in our room
yeah we could do something
coo coo kachoo
alex and I saw mordecai yesterday, the new british humor one with johnny depp
was good
especially if you can follow british humor
Shannon was talking about it, she said it's good too
nice
whatcha fools been up to on ftb?
it wasn't up last night :(
on Thursday I almost finished making a reactor though
sweet
just need a bit (a lot) more diamonds
lol
guess i should finish setting up tinkers so we can get some luck on dem picks and hammers
luck takes so many lapis though
i would love to have a decent pick, lol
450 for fortune 3
lapis is basically trash though
HEY
so it works out
YOU TAKE THAT BACK
LAPIS HELPS US GET RICH MAN
GIVE IT SOME CREDIT
and its preeeeetty
pretty ugly
rude
also, I was doing some experimentation on single player, and it looks like getting a BigReactors reactor isn't as good as they are in later versions of that mod
so they only make ish RF/tick instead of 24k that they do later
hmm
lame
2k isnt bad still
so im thinking reactorcraft fusion reactor is our best bet
because dat power
do we need a constant supply of >2k per tick?
because we could use energy cells as capacitors to provide burst energy at higher rates
but, it takes quite simply a retardedly huge amount of stuff to make
true
I guess I could just run a single extractor at very high speeds
cant talk for a sec, enemy is rushing mcom station b
lol
victory \o/
also, I fully intend to make rotarycraft the single source of ridiculous power for us
water fall to turbine? lol
15 of those in tandem actually makes more RF than that reactor
but it takes waaaaaay more iron
cave herpes
lol
lol
-performs decosun summoning ritual-
you didn't use lamb blood did you?
blood orange
guess it wasn't close enough
nope
damn
well you tried
i want to make tacos
i should make tacos
do it
i dont have any of the ingredients
which means i have to shower and get dressed and go to the store
but I'm already hungry
lol
or
you could not shower, throw clothes on, and drive 5 seconds away to jimboys
you make a compelling argument
but I have other stuff I need to buy anyways
so I may as well go to winco
Hi
HI
I was shopping
:F
for a new bedset
which I bought
noice
youz guyz want survur?
is that a yes?
just a bit
(chomping at said bit)
its up
um
I think it may have poofed for some reason o.O
so it did
launching again
it lives
server will stay up
going to dinner
brandon can we get office through dreamspark?
nope
didnt think so
we can get office 356 with our unr email though
just found that out
office 365 seems weird to me
i just use google docs
anywho i'm off to the store now
okey
bbl
mc crash
ah
btw mumble?
sure, gotta head out soon but i'll hop on til then
same
back
going to get alex
tossed you your pick
thanks
server down?
yeah
It keeps crashing
seems to be one of my pipes
gonna have to McEdit it out
I probably should phase out all those BC pipes I have
bc pipes are yuck
no joke
I only have a few left
they are cheap to make
and leftover from when I first built my base
Thermal Expansion pipes are pretty cheap
That's 99% of my pipes now
so is the server going to come back up?
yes
its loading
if it doesn't crash the second my chunk loader loads in
we're good
dimension loaded
and didn't crash
its up
meister we need more rad/s
yeah he said the reactor was derp at the moment and had to go to work
nah it's working fine
the extractor was having issues
no i mean it wasnt putting out enough power to get the rad/s we needed for the extractor
had to replace the gear box with an undamaged one and then it was fine
yes it was
ohhhh that's right
he told me that after he figured it out
I was supposed to fix that
lol
oops :F
well, I fixed it
lol
tanks
and added enough lube to prevent it from happening again
wanna do dat arrow/wii/stuff?
yeah he said it needed lube too
i kinda maybe already watched arrow :F
lol
:;(
i was bored and all alone
5everalone
well then
but its only 10:30 decoooooo
andrew
yes
hi
just finished arrow
u alive?
no?
ok :(
hi
lol hi
wat doin?
just browsing reddit, lol
gotcha
wanna play something?
si
watcha wanna play
dunno, lol
well, I have: Awesomenauts, hearthstone, ftb, LoL, planetary annihilation, sc: blacklist, and war thunder installed
the fastest way to get unfriended on FB: send me a candy crush game invite
>_<
lol
trivia crack is quite fun
is that a FB game?
oh also I decided to resurface on facebook
nah
I saw that
but it's fb related
like, it has fb integration
What caused the change of heart on the whole FB thing? lol
was feeling nostalgic at home and decided to check up on old high school peeps
well anyways
anywhooz
no awesomenauts or hearthstone. ftb server isnt up, not feeling like LoL, dont have planetary annihilation, blacklist sounds fun but I doubt anyone else is playing it, and war thunder will take too long to update most likely
war thunder probably wont take long
it's only been 1 update
only been 1 update since when? lol
I haven't played it in months
what else are you feeling, maybe i can dl it quickly
yeah it's only been 1 major update since hten
*then
took me like 5 minutes
I know I'm missing the american tanks update
yeah that's it
uhh
lets see
what games have I got...
yeah none of these games look fun
lol
apparently I haven't played WT since October
o.O
really?
yep
wow
i actually feel like playing Zelda OOT or Majora's Mask
I wonder if star conflict has improved at all
yeah I was feeling nostalgic and was looking at downloading dolphin (the gc emulator)
I guess I could just go read and maybe sleep at a decent hour
lol
i am going to play some war thunder for a minute I think
have fun, try not to die
There is a super cool simulator event up
not gonna be possible lol
no markings
orly
no maps
not HUD
o.O
sounds horrible
and no fuel!
ITS AMAZING
its tanks AND planes
sounds like i'd play planes and get absobluetly wrekt
also I thought you were going to bed and thats why the server went down >.>
hey! yeah!
you phoney!
I planned to
TIL deco has a ping every time war thunder is mentioned in skype
lol
lol
I'm playing rising storm
cause
cannot sleep
deco sleeping... OH DAMN WAR THUNDER TIME TO WAKE UP
nobody plans to sleep at 10:30
unless they're over 40 years old
working people do
I work
tomorrow is sunday though
yeah
phony
not tomorrow
But I do work
yeah but there's still plenty of time to sleep before you work
Technically I now work too
I just don't have any fixed hours
idk if grading counts lol
I had to fill out a W4! It counts!
uh huuh
and a direct deposit form
i want a job related to our major :(
lol
well imma go read/sleep
good night
night
enjoy your aeroplanes
mehhhh
i'm just gonna go to bed
lol
enjoy your bed
server is running if anyone wants it
I'll hop on in a minute
hey all
hiya
long time no see mentos o/
Hi
Indeed how's everyone?
Tired
but well
yourself?
I am doing well :D
I'm alright, still over at my parents place for 2 more weeks.
Cool
Finally got some more ram for my laptop :p
4 is better than the 2 that I had, I could add another 4 but then i'd have to update my OS
sounds like you need a desktop
Eventually
I'm looking into building a custom desktop
Seems like the best way to go
I'd say it is
definitely is
1.5k on a desktop is #1 best way to spend 1.5k
lol
Hippos mentioned you fellas having a ftb server up?
yep, deco is hosting it
i think he's taking a nap right now though
Ah
I'll have to ask him when he wakes
oh wait
i know how to summon him
WAR THUNDER war thunder War Thunder
^deco summoning ritual
...draws swasticas in circle and does rain dance
lol
gotta have that sheep blood
ah :p
lmao
it worked
wut
Can I haz join... splashed sheeps blood on keyboard
yes you may
did no one send you the config?
Nope
okay
[Your FTB directory]\FTB Tech World 2\config\powerconverters
Is where that goes
alright thanks
server crashed
what were you people doing
im just building my AE stuff
hmmm
i was flying around the nether
hmm
m31?
he's afk
afk
hmmm
odd
i made a clock at meister's request
i doubt it would have crashed the server
yeah I have a clock as well and that's just fine
an MFR square wave timer clock
is the server coming back up?
I'll have to fix something
but I'm not going to right now
lol
maybe it was just a fluke and it'll be fixed if you put it back up? :D
When I load it back up it instantly hits its memory limit
soooo
yeah
i see
That's a problem
all my wut
yeah
lol
lol
/r/wtf
D:
lol
thumbs u---no
(i dunno y)
its a thumbs up if you have emotes on
(i don't)
it bothers me that those two animations are of different durations
me too
that's odd
well
kinda
it doesnt really matter does it?
lol
no but it bothers me
lol i don't even see them
same duration
i want to play more FTB
me too
hey
hi
so I can't get my page to go online
i've got the html written
and it works
but I can't get to the page
i'm getting a 403
did you set up an account?
yeah
and I did the chmod 0755 that sushil told us to do
also our server is www1.cse.unr.edu
so would it be on that?
or the normal www
mine's on www.cse.unr.edu/~worl
yeah
ours is different
no no no
chmod 777
clearly
clearly
uh huh
clearly
lemme log in to mine and see how I have it set up
meanwhile
deco
fix ftb
lol
at 11:00 at night?
yes
or 10:54, your pick
we just need to spam his computer with "WAR THUNDER" pings until he fixes it
I don't actually have it set up to ping for war thunder
I could though
lol
don't know why I would do that
Doctors - To reach Deco, simply type WAR THUNDER into chat
so, you put the html file in public_html right?
yep, index.html
there is also index.php
but i'm not using that
it was just there already
what's the command to list file permissions? do you know?
no clue, isnt it some permutation of ls?
i thought so but idk
ls -p or some letter like that
ls -l
-rw-r-----
ok my public_html folder has drwxr-xr-x
mine is drwxr-xr-x
index.html has -rw-r--r--
index.html is missing that second r
well
third then
but yeah
that is probably the problem then
yeah
i'm not sure how to change permissions, or if I even can
chmod
what would be the code for that one?
i'm assuming its some kind of hex permutation
322 i think
but 0755 does the -rwxr-xr-x
i'll try it
wait
i was off by 1
lol
sec
it would be
yep
right permutation now
i'll try accessing it
ah, it's octal
that's why hex doesnt make sense lol
ayyyyy
it worked
thank you sir
is yours ~menard or ?
killer website
literally took me five seconds
i've just been trying to get it to show forever
lol
lol
so
I have to get it to do an image of a web comic
I did xkcd and oatmeal
both? ambitious
lol
It was the extra credit
do one and you can do any, really
yeah
it's almost entirely copy/paste at that point
its just img src=URL isnt it?
with a few other things tacked on
i'm pulling up w3
well, he wants you to grab the latest from the remote site
unless that's assignment 2
that's probably assignment 2
assignment 1 is ezpz
(using python)
aha
yeah not yet
that's definitely why he has reg expression tutorial on his page though
lol
yeah
reg expressions are a pain in the ass but so useful
super ezpz
I need to make a website for my senior project
which is also a website
lol
wabsootception
lol sushil has /as1/ and /as2/ etc visible on his site
... and the solutions
seriously, sushil?
o.O
yeah he has the solutions to every assignment available on his website right now
GG
everything up to as6, I dont remember if there's anything beyond that
lol wow
gotta get screenies quick :F
He has literally the entire game engine shell code uploaded there
just download the folders
the as1-6 folders?
yes
of course if you base your solutions off of his it'll be extremely obvious
so I'd suggest against looking at the solutions
yeah I wasn't going to lol
because then you'll see how he does it and not be able to think of different solutions
think I should tell him?
up to you I guess
Don't mention that I pointed it out, lol
I won't, I was like 10 seconds from figuring that out anyway lol
I was wondering why the pages had the /as1/blah as the url and was gonna try the /as1/ and see what came up
did that with engr301 a second ago, candice has some cool but simple looking code for her website
lol
anywho, back to wabsoot
he has all the code to his boats example on here too
including the meshes, sounds, etc
SUPER vulnerable
why he do dis
lol
he wrote the CS 135 submission program, too
I wonder if it has problems like this
that'd be hilarious
From what I hear, most people in CS 135 are morons so
probably secure anyways
you should just go all white hat hacker and try and find vulnerabilities in our cs professor's systems
and tell them about it for a price
lol
lol
i doubt that would work
probably not
I honestly wonder if he knows this is a thing
He has literally the entire game engine available there
He wouldn't put that up on purpose
yeahhh
I'll probably tell him about it
or maybe i'll just link it on the webcampus email to all the kids in the class and be the hero that gets expelled
Knowing him he won't believe you, then he'll probably say something really stupid
Or maybe you'll catch him on a good day and he'll say thanks and fix it
I was just gonna email him with a hyperlink to /381/assignments/ and be like "we shouldnt be able to get here"
Well, you should have access to /assignments/, and he'd probably say exactly that
he just needs to block /as1/ etc until he assigns those
there's no link from the homepage that gives us access to that page though
so I don't think that's a thing
nah, go to /assignments/
no, but if you want to see /as/ you need access to /assignments/
I did
why should we be able to get there?
Because the instructions for as 0 are in that directory
ohhh
true
we shouldn't have access to the /solns/ folder though
but we do
the way he usually does it is he will block access to /as#/ until it is assigned
and then he'll unblock /soln/ like a week later
gotcha
well maybe he just hasnt gotten around to blocking everything yet lol
lol
welp
meh, i'll leave it alone
any student who is even slightly curious will have answers to everything now
so I should tell him?
meh
lol
He didn't let me TA so I don't care
not my problem
lol
heh
just imagine if you were
you should tell him
and be like "guess you shoulda picked me"
lol
lol
what's a .pyc?
compiled python?
yes
makes  sense
how do you even download these folders
the easiest way would be with something like winscp
can't just right click save as?
lol
nope
damn
maybe, idk
gives you a .html
but I could get the pdf's and the python code for the solutions
not that i'm going to
speaking of python, do you still have your linux stick? I want to dual boot my laptop with it for this class
Yeah
mind if i borrow at some point? also if you could help me install python ogre if it tries to be an ogre that'd be awesome lol
since you've done it like 4 times
I don't remember how to install it lol
He had an install script while I TA'd for him last time
which worked fine
yeah I don't think we get that
either that or he hasn't told us yet
he has instructions
but no script
installing it manually was a HUGE pain in the ass
because you had to go in an edit some of the compiler flags unless you had a massive amount of RAM
and there was no indication anywhere about that
interesting
I have lots of RAM on my desktop
maybe i'll dual boot this too
should I?
or maybe I'll just dual boot this
I prefer to just use a VM
me too but I no longer have vmware
vmware player
it's free
and i'd prefer not to bootleg it
?
that the microsoft thing?
no.. it's the vmware thing
lol
oh
lol
that's all he wants i'm pretty sure
lol I'm snooping on other people's sites
how?
I know a few people taking the class
so I guessed their url
lol
any good ones?
he's in my senior project group
other guy in my group doesn't seem to have his website up
or I'm just failing to guess his url
his git thing looks like a penis
lol
a little bit
inverted color
a penis in negative against a pelvis
lol
his javascript for picture to appear thing is kinda weird
There used to be a way to view everyone who had a cse account
he's injecting the image in rather than using CSS to make it appear
yeah
haven't seen that before
it's kinda jquery-ish doing it that way I guess
we're using jquery and html injection for our project
which is probably why he did it that way
lol
interesting
i'll see if I can find any other websites
ah damn, it's on a different server than my account
yeah
you might be able to get a list though
how?
ssh in to your site and do cd ../
and then ls
got it
it should list all user directories on that server
ill see if I find any good ones
do you see one that could be for hardy thrower?
fishie
nope, looks like he hasnt signed in yet
fish one isnt bad, should use classes in place of IDs for the CSS though
also CSS positioning of elements is always iffy for cross-browser and mobile compatability
and using an image for text, in the case of her name, is generally a bad practice
pretty sure this one was using a template
still cool though
it uses jquery
lol one guy just copypasta'd the prof's homepage
yeah just a simple jquery script for those effects
although he definitely copy/pasted the script
because it's referencing a lot of elements that don't exist
yeah, the whole "coffee break" theme thing is something I saw on a website template site
is Katie doing grad school?
i'm not sure
i don't think so though
her website says grad student, but I think this is just the default page template
she's got her job with GE
what's her site?
cse.unr.edu/~gilgen/
yeah i know she's not a grad student at the moment anyway
maybe at some point was her answer iirc
I just saw a few other pages with that exact template
so it must just be the default page
yeah
speaking of pages
I am going to eat a taco
lol
DONT BLINK YOU'LL MISS IT. LIFT UP YOUR HEAD! WE GOTTA GET GONE. YEAH. WE OUTTA HERE!
speaking of blinking and puttng my head down
bed tiem
dont sleep you'll miss it
get out of bed
lol
lol
tah
tah :(
g'day ^_^
ello
how goes it?
it goes well
ohai
o/
client forgot to send me files
that she said were due today
so
:F
ya know
not my problem
i want to play more FTB :F
me too :)
i wanna play bf4
I played a few rounds of rush the other day
We could play a bit after I finish this episode of stargate if you want
mmmehbeh
well the episode just ended
so yes or no?
i'll take that as a no
sorry i don't know if she's gonna send me anything -_-
and we can dump HOURS into that thing
bf4's all updated for me though
WAR THUNDER. Deco, will FTB be up today?
lol
My TrackIR is here
about to test it out
what better way to test it than on FTB?
War Thunder
lol
probably better
i want to FTB
but FTB will be up
I fixed it last night when I couldn't sleep
woo
what was the problem?
A pipe in Kyle's base
it had like  items in it
guess what
it was a BC pipe
probably a BC crap pipe
yup
I'll have him switch over to itemducts
Oh god this is cool
does the TrackIR come with any cool demos or anything?
just the setup thing
but the headtracking is great
and the infared detects all sorts of stuff
its got a mouse emulator too
does it track eyes as well as head orientation? or only head?
only head
i stabbed the underside of my thumb nail with a piece of noodle that was stuck on the bottom of a bowl :(
OH THIS IS SO COOL
PLANE FLYING GONNA BE 3 EZ
lemme know when FTB is up
FTB is coming up
server is running
gracias many thanks great dokosun
crash to desktop :(
ping test
someting wong
internet cut out
try and rejoin
cox says no more ftb, they're now coxblocking your ftb port
wut
no
cockblock joke
lol
thanks tony
:F
shh
also
THAT FUCKING MOMENT WHEN ILLUSTRATOR DECIDES TO CRASh
meister: the redstone clock doesn't make this extractor any faster
I have a feeling illustrator crashing would be annoying as fuck
also brandon i'm pretty sure we did it wrong somehow lol
no
He had it alternating between speed and torque
that worked
it just didnt make it fast
oh really
it made it slow
lol
O.O
odd
no
it was going all torque and no speed
so it was slow
ah
lots of torque, but too slow
gotcha
back
wb
i just crashed to desktop again :(
and to think just yesterday you were saying you had no crashing problems :F
i jinxed it
lol
we found alex's hat
so this should be viewed by courtney whenever she comes back to life
lol
lol god
uber canada
i like how andrew's just leaning out of frame like
holy crap XD Pause's episode 2-4 of H1Z1 is a masterpiece
best story ever
O RLY?
fucking caps
yes
the way it ends
it is so perfect
it totally captures the spirit of zombie survival games
REMEMBER
NO PREORDERS
this is such a weird video
lol
the ending though
it wraps it all together
welp, off to class
bbl
lol no way
ok so
After sending that first client all 360+ files as pngs separated into certain resolutions and sizes
(after I just winged size/dpi since he said it shouldn't matter)
he says he needs psd files now
so of course
I need to know
what size/dpi
T_T
however
FREE FROM OTHER CLIENT
means i can bf4
o/
making my technical briefing about microsoft's hololens
oooh
hi
WAR THUNDER deco FTB? :D
lol
hey you guys wanna check my powerpoint and tell me how it looks?
sure
my only suggestion is to remove anything that hints at uncertainty, such as "seems to be the next step towards full VR" and instead say "The next step towards full VR" or something similar
also AR is probably more accurate than VR
Same deal for "sensors using (probably) similar tech to Kinect 2.0"
Candice will want you to be very confident in everything you say
yeah the vr thing i'll change for sure. as for the specs, they haven't been released so its just a best guess as to what's inside. i'll still remove the probably though since it does look weird
You could mention that MS has experience with augmented reality and has invested in AR sensors, that way it is still factual but doesn't make uncertain inferences or speculation
okey
sounds better to me lol
is this one of the presentations you have to get all dressed up for? lol
yeah
Yeah, pretty sure this is the one I forgot to bring dress shoes for
I had to walk very strategically to keep my feet out of her line of sight
haha
so fake
he needs at least 20 tabs about how to even install chrome open in firefox
and a few terminals, one of which is stalled but he's too afraid to stop it incase it is just doing something that's taking a long time
lol
I just replied to an email I sent to myself
new level of weird for me lol
i like how cubehamster makes a slime block torpedo to destroy water walls, and we just used sand/tnt cannons
lol our tech is so old school now :(
it still works!
and it works on factions, i'm guessing a torpedo wouldnt
probably not
can't push stuff in with pistons
and we had a 1chunk border
can't stop a sand cannon with a bow, either
lol yeah
so android are we gonna do taco tuesday?
umm
probably not yet
I need another week or so before tacos/chips aren't dangerous
lol
I think it's war thunder time
WARRRRR THUNDERRRRR
WT
yesh
that's absolutely whta i'm going for
sure could go for some air planes right now if you know what I mean
right?
me too
how bout that air cobra?
apparently you can upgrade ender quarries
including for speed and silk touch
not in this version
^
yeah
sad
we should throw together a custom modpack with updated versions of everything on 1.7
amen
or
we could let someone else do that and then just use it
oh god lol im playing civ v and just realized that by culture bombing an enemy city, im starving their population
they now have 1 citizen
yeah whenever I play civ I just attack people with pointy and/or explosive objects
I could do that
but atm im just thinking "meh" because im the only person in the industrial (almost modern) era
and im just going to go space race and say so long to everyone else
oh mother of god
"my brother wants to know why it's a green fish and not the actual color of the fish"
"letters aren't naturally red bitch" - what I'd like to say
@_@
sorry
</rant>
you know, taken out of context that whole exchange makes like 0 sense
lol
lol
i designed a poster for someone
even in context it doesnt make much sense
lol
i made the fish green
it's not the natural color of the fish
it matches the logo
so it's eye catching
but that fish isn't actually green
according to the client's brother
where do the red letters come in to play?
aha
because i made the letters red
everyone knows letters are black by default
red is a design choice
as is green fish
but nope
must be fish-colored fish
red fish blue fish
1 2
fuck fish you fish
sorry if that's coming across as rude
i just always rant here
even if it's like 0 context lol
rude fish nude fish
nude fish? ooh fish
fet fish
jango fish
war thunder fish?
war thunder fish
this isnt working
who has the lamb blood?
break out the sacrificial knife
lamb blood
clearly
for Ian
we need the blood of a Jew
it just has to be the blood of an innocent animal, really
yeah, any one will do usuallly
oh
lamb is just for really dire situations where we need him immediately
some animals arent innocent enough though
like spiders
or cats
lol
no, but when those ones are charred by flamethrower it does work about 60% of the time
Ian does love his toasted kittens
or was it toasty mittens?
probably the kittens
and this, ladies and gentlemen, is why we need a full time hosted server
yep
I can feel the boredom flowing
yyyyyyup
bored > 9000
imma try actually playing war thunder
maybe that'll help
T_T
no reague?
reague doesnt summon deco
meh
we want FTB! D:<
m31 is still raging over reague
lol
not raging
just don't feel like playing it
aha
lets all just play war thunder and when ian shows up we'll stop playing and be like "guess you shoulda been here earlier!"
it'll promote behavior for later
afk food
and home
I was getting zee food
The server
it lives
orrrr not
one sec
we have a problem
?
watis
crashes on startup
whodunnit
i blame adam
maybe
it was todays java update
updating java shouldn't break stuff though
Normally yes
want the crash?
sure
Tell me what you see
did you update to java 8? or was it just a small update?
I bet it put me on 8
one sec
if it was a major update like that, then it could break it
v 8 update 31
yup
andrew, I keep getting stupid questions on trivia crack :(
yeah this game pisses me off sometimes lol
"what is the name of the therapy that uses the sunlight on the body"
wat
lol wut
i'd report the question
the grammar is wrong
reinstalling java 7
Actually
my java seems to be broken
entirely
wut
o.o
?
its telling me it doesn't exist
lol
now
its telling my it can't initialize the VM
cause it couldn't reserve enough space
waaaaaaat
lol
good ole java
thanks java /s
It wants 152KB
yeah sure you do java
soooo
it seems to have messed up the registry
for java
java screwed up java
uninstall/reinstall/restart
doing that
okay brb
how'd you guys summon him?
Now its telling me the memory thing again
grr
weird
now there is a registry error again
what the hell java
AH HA
I SEE
Java updated me to the 32 bit version.
in the update
cause
lol
why not I guess
Thanks java
and now we're back to the error I sent you
D:
so it has to be java 8
oh, are you running 64 bit java 8 now?
FTB must not support it yet
yes I was
google says it doesn't
and 7 is installed
server is running
well that was fun
anyways
you can play now
whoops
had to fix the startup
now it should work
lol
so MC wasn't atrocious to update
weird
The doctors never visit :(
too far need teleporters
its closer than canada
crashy crashy
gotta go as well
aww
well, I'll work on the ore 4x'er tomorrow
sounds good
lol
ian, server down for the night?
nope
still running
oh cool :D
you should come see my hydro plant
indeed
his hydro plant was cray cray
it was throwin exceptions left and right like a baws
I fixed that
lol
i got some exceptions when I was there
I wasn't having any thrown at me at least
tomorrow we will have a nuclear reactor
and with it will rival deco's power mwahahaa
hi
hi
server's up
Also
are those reactors even worth it?
they just make steam
which reactors?
reactorcraft ones
well as long as it makes a lot of steam
lol
My point is I'm not sure if it outdoes a railcraft boiler at max size and full heat
I'm sure a fusion reactor would
Ain't nobody gonna build one of those if they suck
Fusions yes
but fission?
dunno
Plus fusion is more like ain't nobody got time for dat
Also the output is rotarycraft power
well that can be converted to RF cant it?
yes
but its somewhat limited
the dynamos can only intake so much
yeah but you can parallelize the power output which can avoid the bottleneck from the dynamos
yo brandogi
hi
hi there
ya hungry?
not really, just ate
ah
was gonna invite you to go with us to wendy's/arbys
coupons and whatnot
i'm down
gimme 4 hours
lol
lets do it
so I made a fission reactor in sp
one at full speed is enough to make extractors go zoom
OPness?
it's k
only runs one turbine at full and another at a fairly low speed
fusion I have yet to build
oh
right
fission
not fusion
yeah
i thought you made the fusion one
lol
no
i will soon :)
probably tomorrow
coo
well, I'm building a kiln. lol
watdo
makes quicklime
which is used in ore 4xing
good god
incoming wall of text to show you guys this dude's post on pirates
english is hopefully not his first language
Pirates a dream of every child story of riches and treasures beyond one's imagination. The actual fax are few and far between. Pirates traveled the world from the Mediterranean to the China Sea. Pirates of been glorified over the years and yet they were just poor and weak people with a dream. These men and women had their own code of ethics and believed in them and would die for them. I was for like Robin Hood take from the rich and give to the poor. But they were also mercenaries, they worked for whoever they could whatever they could pillage and stay strong to a code of ethics. As the pirates of today are not much different than before they still pilferage rape and kill try to make a living. From the 1700s to the current day of  Pirates still roam the seas. Pirates flag has always been a symbol of rebellion. The difference between an inspiring nation and the poor and weak or the Pirates. When it came to Pirates was all about the money.
a very profound and moving statement
indeed
with many... yeah errors of every kind
But they had a code of ethics that they followed while they raped random people and murdered their families
right
they were basically heroes
which made sense
but the rest
so bad
this is a college level class
and the dude's name did not sound at all foreign
it was like edward dunby or something
who wrote that
and in what bloody context
oh wow, newer versions of Engineer's Toolbox have frames
like redpower 2's frames
there's another mod called funky locomotion that does it too
probably better
the ET ones basically just connecto to each other like magnets
the funky loco ones ace exactly like the rp2 ones but better
and there's a magnet socket for modular sockets which will pull the frames
you can have them connect to each other as microblocks
so you can have a frame composed entirely of covers
i made a frame bore with those and applied energistics 2 that goes from bedrock to sky limit and is self sustaining
only 1 wide though
nice
welp, the ET ore multiplier works
it's a tad slower than I'd like
it only gets 4x on certain ores, others get 3x
still good though
i'm 99% sure this guy is literally copypasting his posts from google translate
he just put up a huge contribution on the most recent discussion that's probably worse than his first one I showed you
but this time it' a full screen's worth
what on earth is the context of this?
history of piracy class
but even then his post is nonsensical
lol
oh god you play candy box too
check your email bruh
lol lots of random school stuff that I don't need to read
Please tell me you can pirate stuff for that class
yeah
I pirated one of the books
lol
lol
how do I get microsoft anna to text to speech that dude's stuff
oh god that's the professor?!
what
who's typing yoru piracy stuff dude
a student or a prof?
the stuff I linked was a student
huh
the prof is a cool dude who's recently graduated from berkeley
ok yay
lol
ok really though how do i text to speech this
brandelonian and I did that freshman year with stuff
lol Andrew, do you think he's a troll?
"Ed Gant" is a wide receiver for the Tampa Bay BUCCANEERS
it's a university website, he cant have an account with that name without being an impressive hacker lol
well, he can't be a troll without that
unless he's planning on dropping or something
maybe it's the professor being a troll
that'd be funny
I swear this could be an essay writing bot that uses phrases and keywords from texts and compiles them into a semi-coherent-but-mostly-nonsensical essay
like
there is no way this is a human
lol
did you read it?
is the mc server still up?
like
honestly
not the 2nd one
yes it is
it's even worse
and don't hate me when you get on
what did you do?
lol
a loud thing
lol
ahhh
loud is better than "used the rest of the space in your underground lair for asymmetric, inefficiently placed machines that do nothing with no care for the general layout"
now THAT would make him hate you
lol
asymmetric? yes, hidden? mostly yes
but practical
well at least you only hit two of the four :P
also tony ed gant is a fifth string reciever on the bucks
lol
lol
DECO
I have work in the morning :/
THE DRAGON IS FRACKING ALIVE
wat
lmao
haha
I heard its dying sound
goddamnit
I thought adam killed it
wither
?
that was a wither
maybe
fuuuuu
if you mean the sound that played a day or two ago, it was a wither
welp, time to fight a dragon while totally undergeared
lol
psh you can kill it with snowballs
this is true
I have a half full jetpack, a tinkers bow, and a bedrock sword :F
ezpz
I could hop on and use my gravel gun and kill it in seconds
go get em!
guess I should be able to do it
server's down for the night, ap
oh
I have quantum armour and a sword that does 80 hearts of damage
well
just as I finished my work
I have to sleep
cause work
i have to get up at 8 tomorrow but you dont see me sleeping!
why the hell do you have to be up at 8?
half day for me tomorrow
class
o.O
so server should be up around 2
oh cool
i have class at 9:30 tomorrow
i have class that ends at 215
I have another class that starts at 2:30
well that sucks
lol
oh lol i just tried to google him and the buccs page showed up
and I thought to myself, "Ain't that some shit."
I am AFK but the server is running for those interested
now to kill a dragoon
wish me luck
in before:
-01-29 01:15:06 [INFO] m31ster was slain by enderdragon
nnnnnnnnnnnooooooooo
lol
so the green barrels are freaking pretty
oh yeah, and he ded
lol
yo brando
hi
hi
wanna go to winco with me and then have chicken of some sort for dinner and possibly (if riley and katie end up coming over, we asked) do a game night?
hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmyes
the winco part is optional
but if you need to go i'm gonna get stuff for salsa
i dont really wanna go to winco lol
okey
lol
well imma do that
and you can come hang whenever
sounds good
alex is making one kind of chicken now, and she's making teriyaki chicken later since it takes less time, and she's also making rice
so yep
also we could do arrow/flash
indeed
oh also could we borrow the rice cooker?
sure
coo coo kachoo
do you wanna come over and hang out?
when? now?
yeah
nah, not right now
My base has been forcibly made into Deco's colony D:
<.<
ummmm
crashed
rebooting
ah
Yeah its bork
If I can't fix it I can roll back about 40 minutes
umm
if i had information as to what was going wrong would it help
<.< Maybe
natural gas explosion
oh
yeahhhh
how did that happen
very carefully
it's in the nether
woooooooooooooooooooooooooow
bedrock level
sowwy
we didnt know it would be that bad :F
I may have have to gen a new nether then
Are you guys in the nether?
yup
Steven confirmed that he was in the nether
and the server crashed on his login
I could McEdit the chunk out of existence
please :3
don't want to lose my bedrock breaker
well
I'll try something else real quick
no more nether fracking people <.<
AP
can you log in
so uh
can you tp my dude out of there?
lol
yeah
you need to log in though
yeah i'm dying
:F
dang
I hit it right as you logged in
lol thanks for trying
restarting
not sure why it broke... we tried 64 tnt before that and it was fine :F
no more gas
just use a sonic bore
no more gas indeed
or something not explosive
yeahhhh lol
Sonic bore super good
and safe
m31 don't worry its safe
lol
guys
brandon is the best
like
seriously
wow
he's so cool
I know right Brandon?
How much did he pay you?
What? no this is andrew speaking
haha
Brandrew
is the server still up?
yup
do we have big reactor turbines?
I think I will use an algae hydrogen farm to generate power
a small algae farm can easily power over 100 steam dynamos apparently
no we don't have reactor turbines :/
darn
I would have made one already
a small algae farm can also apparently power 2 big reactor turbines for 50k rf/t
super algae + watering can in an autonomous activator is apparently really effective
:/
you get 3 buckets of hydrogen per super algae, and it's apparently 80% as good as BC fuel
we need a 1.7.10 modpack
that'd be nice
it really would
no 1.7 modpacks that have rotary/reactorcraft
ugh
really?
lame
guess it isn't updated yet
was just gonna ask that
not sure how up to date this is, but: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AgnSLIUjIjLcdGtTcWRUWUxEODVBY0Q4N1FSV3dlRUE&usp=drive_web#gid=0
list of up to date mods, though im pretty sure that this list is outdated
yeah it's not updated
the list, that is
lol yeah
looking at the RC github, it should be updated to run on 1.7
we might be able to fudge together our own modpack, if that's a viable option
Brandrew
dig it
sup
lol i just like the name combo
great business merger
lol
it's actually raining in vegas
love iiiit
interesting
hi
hi
hi
hello
what is up
currently the ceiling
what is going on
not much
watcha want to do
play moar FTB
(it's worse than drugs)
lol i believe that
lol it is indeed
I had a dream we found shale plasma, andrew
also the Engineer's Toolbox dev seems to be MIA
orly
you should pick up the development
lol
I could
it's all open source
would probably be kinda fun
although I think making your own mod would be better
working with someone elses project just seems like it'd be weird
Taking ownership of a large body of code is always difficult
I have discovered that shale plasma looks exactly the same as shale gas
and WAILA just calls it "shale gas"
:F
well then
war thunder?
:F
new starbound update
interesting
blah
leagueing
might join you after I check out the changelog
this update actually looks really, really cool
like
what I expected from the game in the first place
lol what do you mean?
the visual update?
no, they did a full on overhaul of like everything
he's talking about the starbound update, not league
oh pft lo
oh yeah
oooooohkay
lol
XD
thought that was apparent :P
no because league also had some patches
yeah but he literally just said "new starbound update"
^
<<< 
not "starbound changelog"
league updated too
"new starbound update. might join you after i checkout the changelog"
i thought a new patch was gonna qualify or disqualify him from playing the game
2 games discussed
could've been either or especially when I have a certain bias
lol
anyway
yeah
starbound update
looks awesome
lol
starbound just looks boring to me
new stuff
looks like a ton more fun
i am generating over 1k rf/t on a test world perpetually
that sounds nice
whelp, starbound definitely has more stuff to it now
still needs people to play with though
kinda boring single player
thal is hosting a server
yeah he's playing right now as well
but I dont have time fo dat
speaking of not having time
WAR THUNDER
IANDECOSUNWARTHUNDERTHETHIRD
whelp
I tried
even used sheeps blood to try and summon him
y no workey
so there's a bug that lets you get unlimited free lava
i like unlimited and free
how do we capitalize on free lava?
magmatic dynamo or lava generator
neither of those sound OP
i have 30 hooked up to the lava source
rf/t
pshh
that's nothing
it's more than my base currently produces lol
meister is making progress towards a fusion reactor though
well yeah because you don't have 30 redstone generators
is the server uP?
i have 8 heated redstone generators
which make around 2k rf/t
slightly less
also MFR has a ingot unifier
which is nice
oh cool
we have like 9 types of copper
lol
lol yeah
we could also use a tinker smeltery to unify them
thought of that a while ago but forgot to mention it
it's also very slow
this thing doesnt cost power and is fast and automatable
it can also convert sticks/bamboo etc
oh wow
nice
what about planks? lol
won't convert between oak and birch planks
oh wait
it just converts all planks to oak
that's kinda nice
for storage anyway
it messes up their name though
its weird
not that we produce anything but oak
it can kinda convert planks
certain mod planks wont convert correctly
extra utils wood and ET wood converts
interesting
trying to look at the resurrection pack and good god it takes 5ever to load up
literally took 4 minutes
hahah so to get the lightning bolt bullets you now have to get the heart of a supercharged creeper
I think they realized they were powerful
lol
Hey
hi
Your crack dealer is back
hi
server is up
I am getting dinner though
gotta get dat ftbcrack
so I'll be back
no gas explosions please
lol
don't worry
i'll be elsewhere
dat crash to desktop
whelp, i'm now rank 6 in hearthstone, one rank higher than last month :P
each month I get like one to three ranks higher
woo unified our ingots :D
nice nice
well shit
I need a compactor to finish this thing
the rotarycraft one?
yeah
doesnt look too bad though
is the server down?
yeah
it poofed
while I was trying to craft something
but in a dnd session so :)
also, I have the toroidal magnets set up and am working on the solenoid
(down the elevator)
woo hit rank 5 in hearthstone
at rank 5 you don't get winstreak bonuses so it's considered the top tier before being in the legend bracket :D
but the war thunder
whaddabout it?
Have you seen the new events?
yeah I don't have the tanks so I couldnt participate
No tanks?
Get German or Russians
American tanks
(except M41)
suck
I have german, but not high enough tier, and I have the kv1 but it's the same slot as my plane that I want to use and thats no fun
put your plane in another slot?
or tank
no tengo moneys
bought the ki-43
Ki-43-III?
yeah
I also have the ki 61 after that but not enough lions to buy it
Ki-43-III is better than the plane that follows it
yeah but i like the 61s for arcade, they're just a little more... idk american in nature I guess lol
no server = lame
:F
hi
ih
I'm guessing FTB is down for the night?
ftb's been down since like 930
oh
lol
I was skyping with shannon since 8:30 lol
hot dayum
nice
two hours is pretty good, was it all good conversation?
i think so
lol
we got in a debate regarding morals/ethics
I enjoyed it, I think she got frustrated by it :p
She believes in an absolute right/wrong and absolute set of ethics
one of our kinda debates or a real debate with real facts and things
And I don't believe anything is absolute
so hence the debate
gotcha
one of our kinds
yeah I agree, nothing is absolute
Indeed
She made very good counter arguments
except the simple sad fact that we will not live forever
starting with the face that "nothing is absolute" is an oxymoron
that is a good one
lol
lol
but yeah, absolute right and wrong I think not
It basically ended up with us arguing almost the same point, except she couldn't accept the fact that I base right and wrong on my own morals, rather than some absolute morals
and that it is still okay for me to judge people as right or wrong on a relative scale to my own beliefs
which makes total sense if you read it like that, but I think if you hear that mid-conversation it'd be much harder to grasp that kind of concept
lol
yeah
Morals and ethics are effectively useless
lol
Well, my girlfriend would very much disagree with that statement. lol
well i mean they're pretty useful for a successful society
without morals or ethics humans would be largely useless to each other
a lot of the things humans achieve are based on emotion of some kind
which is largely governed by morals and ethics
lots and lots of gray area
even absolute morals can be relative
but absolute is by definition not relative
so one ultimate scale accross time and space?
yes
odd concept
understandable
but odd
buh i'm too tired to actually articulate my thoughts
gnite
night
you people already said everything significant lol
lol yes I talked about it for at least an hour earlier today already >_<
hahah
people who make up words kind of confuse me
like
bonus points to them for social engineering the thought that they're smarter than everyone
but I don't know how this gent came up with "Dyson Tube" for a Stereographic Projection
soup
crackers
banana nut muffins
^_^
make any more progress on the reactor, meister?
some progress on the solenoid
server crashed before I could make the machine to finish it
building one in creative atm
looks awesome so far
i placed 1 block of nether plasma in the world
the world is now on fire
lol
death to sp world?
I have 12 drums of nether plasma on the server
I could literally burn the entire world
wow
it took 4 chimney shafts, but I finally got the plasma out of my tunnel
from a single shale gas block I can easily supply natural gas to 16 gas generators connected to 32 gas turbines
for around 1100 rf/t
not bad
for how long?
could at least double that if I used slickwater for fracking
no clue
but I can pick up shale gas blocks using a boring machine
although replacing the shale block would be annoying since I'd have to break a piece of bedrock after it gets depleted
that tray looks so....i dunno, cleaner
?
the item bar
Also I can power a railcraft boiler with natural gas
simpler than i remember
I use normal size gui instead of auto
ahah
which is probably why
And I can power a railcraft boiler with nether plasma
which burns for MUCH longer than any other fluid in a boiler
so this reactor is looking more and more doable
believe it or not
that's good
lol
because no matter how much I try, I can't get a reasonable power:resource ratio out of engineer's toolbox :(
charging the magnets and spinning the solenoid takes 8 magnetostatic engines on full
which is easily taken care of by the amount of power this thing will output
we'll need to jump start it somehow though, right?
yes
shouldn't be too hard
we have enough energy cells to power 8 for a bit
im building this in a way that lets me port it into mp very easily
yup
2 resonant cells should be more than enough to get the jumpstart we need
using creative cells in this one just for ease of access though
I've never actually heard of anyone depleting one of these shale gas blocks
I might make a small gas setup just to cover idle base power consumption
not that power will be an issue with a fusion reactor
lol
the ET stuff just looks so cool: http://i.imgur.com/N08HKQv.jpg
lol nether plasma florbs
oh god
they throw without any arc
pretty sure that looks cooler
lol
yeah
it does
lol
nether hard mode: http://i.imgur.com/Rqkwh2d.jpg
wtf did you do
tossed a few florbs
rofl
deco should put up the server
yup
lol my SP TPS is at like half what it should be now
:F mine is at 19.6 with only this reactor
i'm at 4.2 TPS :D
oh dear god
lol
wait nvm, mine's fine
server is booting
wooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
no I didn't just blow up a van de graff
i have no idea what you're talking about
did you remove the steam generator things you had by those furnaces?
Van De Graffs are cool but I can't find a use for them
no?
they're all gone
lol
they mustve poofed
they do that every once in a while
mumble?
sure
we need 65536 lodestones, or 205 stacks of magnetite ore. lol
kill.
me.
wat
reika is a bastard
that's wat
mod?
yes
for a fusion reactor
rotary/reactorcraft
ah
i may just hop in mumble to chat
o_O
last line
"it doesn't work"
lololol
lol
is the server down?
how come every time I hop on, the server is down? DECOWARTHUNDERSUNIAN :P
playing war thunder if anyone wants to join
i think it crashed
because it just kinda went down
gotcha
Yeah
it crashed
while I was AFK
10/10 server
100/100
I'm aboot to go to dinner
and it appears to be a BC pipe again
damn bc pipes
EVEN THOUGH I TOLD KYLE TO SWAP HIS PIPES OUT
you should just replace all bc pipes with exploding natural gas
Same effect
both result in no server
lol
im board
hi board
hi
whatcha doin?
CSS
making a top bar for the submit site
with user name and account options
nice
stupid dryer
it makes my whole apartment super humid
yeah thats why we close the door and run the fan when we use ours
my door is closed and the fan is run
but the door has slits on it
yeah that's an issue
lol
tape it shut
that'd be a lot of tape
the whole door is literally slits lol
nothing but slits
lol
still doable
why did I make this quesodilla so cheesy
probably because you called it a queso-dilla, which is using the masculine version of queso, whereas a quesadilla is the proper spelling and is using the feminine version of cheese. so basically i'm saying take the cheese like a man or spell it right!!!!
why the hell is there a male and feminine version of cheese
the fuck
there isn't
it's just spanish
lol
which is weird
i thought queso looked wrong but I reasoned that cheese = queso so it was right
maybe your queso-dilla uses cheese from male cows
lawl
lmao guude ate some berries on sims, and now his sim is flirting with a brown bear
lol
they were "special" berries
I was gonna say that reminds me of the berries from... what the fuck game was that
OH
unturned
lol
haven't played that in ages
or minimum
speaking of unturned, they're expecting to release 3.0 to the publc in a month
or so
m31 was playing minimum a few days ago
oh did you see how many lodestones we need for the fusion reactor?
yeahhhhh
that's a lot
9.5 million
good thing we can extract magnetite
65536 was wrong, it's 9500000ish
yeah i know that doesnt really help lol
wut
no way
i realize now that ftb is SE in lego form
literally 9.5m?
SE has nothing on FTB
yes
jesus
yeah
SE is releasing their programmable AI soon
meister is building a big boring thing in the deep dark
c/c# I think
does anyone know where to sell prints online?
deviantart?
besides gumroad / redbubble / etsy / crated?
he has i think 6 boring machines with silk touch
NOPE not dA
.....maybe hold on
didn't even htink of tha
oh also we're using steam from natural gas for power now
they do commissioned things on there
nice
did the server go up recently?
nope
lol
lol
also
i fixed the mob spawner
and then
i blew it up
kaboom
yeah i figured
lol
lol
creepers again?
damn button on that door is hard to press
haha
flipped the lever, creepers appeared, and I was still in there
yeah that's why I usually shut the power off and control it that way
rather than the lever
indeed
pew pew
I am back
hi hi
AND I fixed the problem
Shall I put it up?
now if only I could fix this horizontal alignment problem with my CSS
I'll play if other people do, otherwise I'll stick to my CSS
Lets see if I get much of a response
why is this div 100% width!??!?!? IT MAKES NO SENSE
is the page live?
no, hosted locally
I don't think our server is running at the moment so I can't push the changes
...hm
i dont' know if this will help
but usually all o fmy problems revolve around centering / not centering
lol
i am setting this <ul> to have a width of 300px, yet it has a width of 0
y
i forgot display: inline-block was a thing... >_< problem solved
lol
before: http://i.imgur.com/iiPRb5R.png
still needs some work, but it's improving
also I am afraid to view this site on mobile
I had to do some hacky stuff for that top bar
awesome
anyways that's enough css for one day
that second version looks way better
looks like a well made website
the old version looked like a giant kerning error
lol
a kerning error? lol
(leading)
is that not how it's spelled?
whispered from the side of the room.
where rn looks like m
lol it's kerning
but
okay
lol
vertical kerning is called leading
yeah, i dont see how it resembles a kerning error though lol
oh gotcha
so you're not technically wrong
oh
the top bar
ah
collided words
it just has some separation issues
yeah
cs herpaderp and the number
yeah the assignment table and such
all the fonts were actually wrong in the before pic
my group member imported a totally arbitrary css file
which changed ALL the fonts
on the entire site
lol
lol
maybe that's why
there were also unformatted tables
I just meant the sections to the site seemed to be all together rather than separate entities, and now they are visibly separated and look nice
yeah
just tried to stretch a metaphor with the kerning error
i like my little user name dropdown menu thing in the top right
always remember kerning with keming
lol yeah thats why i was confused and asked if I spelled it wrong
creepy as fuck
lol
i recognize those banks
fucking gold from #13
"yo momma's so redneck, she thinks 'kern' is on the cob"
fixed #3
this is actually a great insight to your color perception
saving
lol
minecraft is up, but I am going out for a bit
uhh
did the server go boom?
just make sure you fix the storage bus on the thing when it's done pushing limestone
will do
Super bowl day is the best day to go shopping
lol
It is
Fashion Show was EMPTY
it was great
where should I build your portal, deco?
hmmm
Brandon Worl
Ian
Courtney Boyle
Thomas Moore
whyfor callin?
minecraft
ah
writing essay sadly
:F
nosgoth looks like fun
Brandon Worl
Ian
Courtney Boyle
Thomas Moore
dig it
tanks
I'm pretty pleased with how the styles are coming along
there's still like 50 pages left to clean up like that... but it's kinda fun at least
ok so question....
what do you think would work better for portfolio stuff?
or my current site?
big picture is cool
the animation is a bit choppy for me though
yeah....
so big picture for a portfolio?
it would be a cool looking portfolio imo
hmm ok
...only 6 images though @_@ ugh
you could probably add more
i have another idea actually...
all these tabs just to convert unix time to local user time http://i.imgur.com/23Nwuex.png?1
I actually had about 2x as many but I closed the first half
lol
thoughts?
I like the background
is the what is herpaderp an image or text?
text
but it scales and changes like the images
cool
cool
don't you love it when you think a certain styling is going to be difficult and it turns out easy as pie?
I love when anything does that
lol
that image bugs the shit out of me
I keep trying to scroll down
but I cant
lol
live will be up soon
er
"in a week or something"
I made Aubergines for dinner
wat
indeed, wat?
Aubergines
wat
bless you
gesundheit
eggplant
looks like an egg plant
yummy
Aubergine = Eggplant
yeah
I fried them
very yummy
what else did you eat them with?
and made chinese sweet chili sauce
aha
and served with noodles
that's something I didn't expect
but it sounds good
It was very good
fried eggplant with parmesan, marinara, and spaghetti is really good too
aubergine and cavendishes
I like chinese over italian, which is why I did that
what other classy sounding names for foods exist
I didn't make any cavendish?
lol
no but i did learn cavendish from you
schwip schwap
lol
schmetterling
that's not a food
schmetterling
lol
it could be
not with that attitude
mmmm
sounds buttery
stick it in a blender with a nice taquito and you got yourself a meal
schmetterling
tastes like dreams
and flying inscets
bored
me too
i'm writing that python script
ah, how's it going?
but I don't want to figure out the logistics for replacing the text
in your html file? make a comment and replace the line after it
I already have a function that backs up my file and a function that gets the most recent image from xkcd, and yeah I know that's all I have to do
but doing it is the annoying part
cause you have to use re
regex
yes
yeah
lol
annoying :F
regex strings are pretty confusing
lol
you have to use regex for getting the image url as well
yeah
it's not so much that they're confusing
its more I don't want to have to think about it right now
lol
...is mailto the best option?
it works for some people
it's better than nothing
hm
you should've sacrificed people for more points
Nobody really came close to death though
The entire time the only ailment to afflict you was getting bit by a snake
o.o
cholera, broken arm...
Ian brok his arms a few times. Andrew broke his arms and got bit by snakes. Shannon was bit by a snake and got cholera twice
lol
good job on keeping everyone alive
wtf are you peeps talking about
so she came closest to death, though that all happened right at the start
oregon trail
"deluxe"
not to be confused with organ trail
yeh
"deluxe"
lol how did you just end up in the middle of a conversation
magic
the first half was telepathic
pshh
I like oregon trail
havent played it in forever
thoughts?
A few things
It'd be nice if you hid the way they all start left aligned and then snap in to position after a moment
Also the gaps in the grid are a bit distracting
Finally, I think having justified text would look nicer
gaps?
oh
as in the square spaces yeah
wait gaps
window isn't fully maxed is it?
the holes where a small image should go
it is
weird
do you see the text field?
i see 3 of them
unless you mean an actual text field
that I can type in
yeah i agree with all of brandog's points
definitely justified text
ok shall try
and waiting to show the images until they're loaded and placed isnt too hard iirc
it's not
it's easy with jquery
i think you guys solved it like 3 times
and I gnored all of it T_T
you did
lol
i have a mood for working on it and a mood for not T_T
i was so done with this thing way back when
....hmmmm
mobile sized it looks...bad
mobile doesn't look horrible
i left aligned it for when it shrinks like that
just kinda monotone since it's just a straight up scrolling page
there was a weird space between my name
honestly you should probably just have a different web-setup for mobile
fffffffuuuuuuuuuuu
no
no?
Responsive design is what people want to see
dedicated mobile sites is very 's
having a consistent design is more user friendly too
by gaps you meant open squares, yes?
yes
ok
i'll just have to have more shrinky images
good motivation
so last to fix is the js thingy
the current images should be able to form a grid without any gaps, no?
yeah if you resize it right
if(( < 3000)&&(>=)){
   cout << "It's still the 's" << endl;
}
my fully maxed one
no gaps
if true and true
i thought masonry would form a gapless grid at any resolution?
if there was blocks to fill the spaces
my issue is i want everything big
it can arrange them to remove the gaps on my screen, it just doesnt
if i shrunk more easy fix
weird
mine does
gaps are...variable
only fix is to have them all tiny
at least that's what my exhausted mind thinks
If all the images form a grid, it is possible to never have gaps on any layer but the last
dunno why it does that
updated live site
is curious why the images don't push upward
i need to fix that later though
5:30 am is oging to murder m enow
and i'm not really in teh mood for that...
nite
wait 1 sec
quick please
patchwork to evil, pizza to your face
then shift have an idea and below up 1
then there's no gaps
but it doesn't do it
there's an order to them
i wonder if it strictly follows that order
maybe
could be the reason why
dozer
morale
crossboard
birdseye
dragonboard
evil
grimtaste
kaboom
noctum
knowevil
patchwork
idea
self
strange
sushibros
vnucleus
graphit
scorpion
monogram
if you make it single column that's the order it follows
pizza
hellow
should i not make it a single column
no that's fine
weird
oh, apparently masonry uses filler images to fill in gaps instead of just arranging the images to avoid gaps
...wat
that's new
listen here mofo
lol
you said it not me
I'm just trying to save lives here
you are freakin fast
hey
we're not pioneers
also
hi
aren't you though?
i am
but i won't sacrifice her for points
lol
now that's love!
lol
ok for rill
bedtime
will fix js later
sleep well fair traveler
when only 5 hours of sleep isn't a posibility
T_T
tony.sleep(18000000);
brandon, i would have 6-0'd you but they had the wrong answer for who was the prime minister of great britain at the end of wwII
:F
lol
winston churchill was outed in 45, but the war wasnt over (technically) until after he was beaten
that's the second missed win today because of wrong answers on their end
I was playing my mom and it asked what the second fastest fish is
I knew the fastest was the sailfish
but it said the sailfish was second fastest
we have't even discovered like half of all fish species
yeah, but still lol
is there an easier way of replacing the string than:
having a marker around the string to replace, using regex to find the start and stop locations of that string, taking everything before that string + new url + everything after, save to file?
hallo?
:F
downloadable tracks
Concussive is BassnectarxRenholder, Ethereal is Nosaj ThingxPretty Lights and Kinetic is The Crystal MethodxDada Life
brandog you awake?
nvm, was gonna have you look at my regex and help me figure out what was wrong with it, but I figured it out
just have to double check saving it to the file is working now
hi
hi
finished the url updater
it only works for xkcd and cyanide and happiness, wasn't sure how to make it more flexible than that without ridiculous amounts of planning
easy, just have a particular regexp for each comic, and a different comment in the html marking where to insert each
two is no more complex than ten
yeah, i would just have to pass arguments to the functions from the console when you run it for what url you want to grab it from and what the comment is I guess, then work around that information
how long was yours?
I had one function for xkcd, another for the oatmeal. each one was around 25 lines i believe
wanna see mine?
sure
weird that it included the .py, I just copy-pasted the name from my terminal in putty lol
guess it grabbed the whole line rather than what I had selected
oh weird
it replaced some stuff with $
your script did?
nah, when I moved the code from putty to notepad
once my craptop VM boots, I'll show you how I did mine
lol ok
look at the end of the really long lines
$ indicates that there's more off screen
oh
well then
:F
lol
vmware player froze
....
oh there it finally goes
I should install my new hdd on my desktop
and then move these VMs over
that sounds like fun
lol
kind of
moving stuff from the dying HDD, not really
yeah that just seems sketchy
I don't actually have any power or SATA cables though
I -may- have an extra power cable and SATA cable
I have extras in vegas
i'd have to look
and I'll be in vegas in... not very long
like 1.5 weeks
I think I have another SATA cable, but i may have used my last one because I broke the one that was originally hooked up to my dead SSD
lol
I'll just use mine, that way they all match
who knew there was a latch you had to release before you pull it out?
yes, there is a latch
lol
lol
did you watch last week's flash?
no
wanna attempt to watch them both tonight? or at least one lol alex gets off work at 10
uhhhhhh I have to write a website today lol
oh really?
what for?
yeah
senior projects
a website about our website
oh that's right
lol
I'm gonna go with the ever so popular single page design
there's a cool css trick that makes those really easy to do
then toss in a dash of jquery and bam, good looking website
nice
is that r you have in front of the regex string to make it raw and get rid of the need for escapes on "?
no clue
lol
i thought the r was required?
lol
to indicate that it is a regular expression
maybe on an older version? no idea
it's definitely not needed now
That was my understanding of it, at least
figuring out that you need the ? for the .*? part (anything in the middle) tooke me forever
it just makes it so that it's not greedy
the greedy version keeps going until it finds the longest string that matches lol
so I kept getting like the entire file
yours is like mine but all in one function lol
Are we doing taco tuesday?
umm
we could
at like 10
I just had pizza like 40 minutes ago
But I am starving now
lol
eat an opossum
I may just go to the drive thru in a bit
I don't want to go shopping today
so, I need a big image to put on the top panel of this website that captures the spirit of programming and my senior project
wat
"disk quota exceeded"
on my cse web account
lol
typical single page smooth scrolling product site layout
I like it
did you find your big image?
i just went with that circuity-looking image
lol
gotcha
it looked good enough
lol
lolol
how did you get into a rank 4 match?
REPOST
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
sorry, was trying to post it in another chat
lol
lol
were not cool enough? :(
wanted them to share in the awesomeness of that
so meister, why don't we upgrade our big reactor? seems like we have the resources to make one that would output quite a bit of power
yeah
just make a really big one
it is a viable option
probably easier than 9.5 million magnetite
true
my war thunder won't start correctly in full windowed mode
it's offset and I can't see the top of it

seems legit
how?
He ran out of gas
lol
Ian
warum?
weil sie war thunder spielen
danke
Ian
progress :D
that second pagelet should have bold text, kinda hard to read with the background
definitely dig the style of the first page though
Can't really make it bold
but yeah it is a bit difficult to read
there, that's a bit easier to read
gonna make it so hovering over the pictures pops up a little blurb about each person
not much left to do. make it look nice, test it, etc.
lol
lol
those parts aren't formatted yet
that's not what i meant to post
saw that
lol
lol
Just when I was impressed by how much stuff I had open at once on my desktop, my entire computer crashes
>_<
lol
lol
lmao wat
this guy commented on facebook "what a baaabe" and it gave me a button to translate his comment
so i clicked it and it translated to "what a babe"
lol
lol
A guy just told me he reported me for hacking in war thunder
you hacker
rofl
I shot his Meteor Mk.3 down with my Ki-10
He just sucked
really bad
lol
lol
well it's hard not to suck when you have a hacker on your tail
Hacker 1936 biplane chasing down your 1945 jet

Hi
hi
hi
so some acquantances named their child "Epic"
Epic Failure?
lol
"Epic Indigo (last name)"
XD
i just realized
his initals are gonna be "EW"
Your acquantances do not sound all that smart
hence acquaintances and not friends lol
I can only take so much CSS before I start going crazy
oh i understand
went from 5-2 to 5-5 in rank placements
fucking people I swear to god the game is not that hard
lol what game?
league of fuck this shit
ahah
i'm familiar with that
hearthstone best game, no teams
yuck hearthstone
eh
speaking of which i can probably uninstall that..
Games based entirely on luck are lame
mincarft server
I don't care bout y'all hatin on my game, I'm getting good at it and :P
lol i was gonna say
we all just kinda dropped the hammer on andrew
I'm getting good at tossing dice, bro
lol
And brandon's a pro coin flipper
there is much more than just dicerolls in hearthstone, which you'd know if you looked closely
sure, draws are random
sure, some cards have random effects
it's how you apply them
and It's not a game of winning or losing one game
deco, can you start up minecraft please? need some no stress time
don't try to stop our anti hearthstone circlejerk
it's like baseball
i miss hawken
I'd say its more like bridge
and sure
one sec
sure, you're not going to win all of your games due to bad draws, etc
but you can win with skillful play with the cards you do draw
and especially in tournament play there are lots more factors that contribute to being actually good at the game
but you know
and 80% luck
dicerolls
like I said, luck is a factor, sure
you know what game doesn't take luck?
yes yes yes we get it it isnt all luck
but if you watched someone play or played it yourself, you'd see that you can get super unlucky and still pull out a win with good plays
minecraft
Server is up btw
ty
I'll hop on once I finish restructuring this page
i've played
MC's name servers may be down
i give it a resounding meh
sorry mate
that's totally fine
lots of people don't like the game
I'm just saying there IS legitimate skill involved
it never took me on an emotional rollercoaster
I'm the only one who plays war thunder religiously
lol
lol
DAMNIT MINECRAFT
Combat sims are kind of a niche though if you don't have infantry
Y U DO DIS TO ME
see, different strokes, different folks :P
blokes*
War thunder is virtually 0 luck though
my crew has bad luck
Multiplayer session service
This service is down! We are doing our very best to resolve the issue as soon as possible.
they always get shot in the face
soooooooooo
yup
speaking of war thunder
yup
getting on
Ian
Thomas Moore
andrew join us
join usssss
nope
homework
skip it?
even then, I have to do laundry, clean the kitchen, and eat/make dinner
got a gf to keep happy, ya kno?
no, I don't
haha
lol
well, now that I'm done working on my website for today, it's time to work on my website's website
Ian
Thomas Moore
is meinkraft fix yet?
yes but he took the server down
>.>
I feel like playing space engineers again
I almost feel like it
waiting for programmable ai
which is "soon*tm"
well, they already have a released api
they also have in-game programming
are they planning on doing something AI specific?
well tehy may already have it done I guess, I didnt think they did though
They don't have gui programming yet, as far as I know
oh hey
they did add it
programming block
yeah, since new years ish
tbh I can't really see any actual useful stuff you can do via the api though
they might not have finished it then, you're supposed to eventually be able to progam ai ships to follow you and do stuff
like turtles
you can, technically
but you could do that without programming too
how?
sensors that trigger gyros and thrusters
oh yeah, those sensors are lame though lol that's like making a circuit rather than programming something already circuited for you
yeah i looked at it
I wish they used a nicer language than C#
yeah, but it might be fun (for me) since I havent learned it yet
It's an alright language but I hate when everything has stupid prefixes like "IMyControlPanel"
the dude who did a tech presentation in my engr301 class on SE had some outdated info I guess, he said programming wasnt ready yet
and when everything is so wordy
lol
at least it's not java
yep
C# is basically as wordy as java though
gross
They should add in advanced sensors that can detect stuff like the x,y,z coordinates and velocity of other ships
or the pos/vel of your ship
with that you'd be able to do cool stuff
yeah like radar or something, I think you can access the velocity of your ship
yeah, you need the velocity of the target too to do much though
yeah
i guess you can calculate velocity if you can at least get position
I am starving but I am sick and don't want to go shopping >_<
yeah, either that or just some math with your engines being on for x amount of time at x acceleration per engine
lol
shopping is lame
randomly getting sick is lame
alex randomly got sick too
yeah
no bueno
I think I got food poisoning or something >_<
2 of you "randomly" sick
andrew stop poisoning them
rude
hey, yours is on the way, keep bashin on my game :F
he did it for the extra points
lol
lol
alex got a cold
you probably got lazy and ate something 5 years old so you ddint have to shop
yeah I woke up at 6:45ish to go throw up and expel other fluids from my body
nah man, I ate a pot pie
right
did you make sure it was cooked to 165*F?
I cooked it at 400*F for 48 minutes D:
The other 3 pot pies didn't try to kill me under the same circumstances
well maybe all of them were undercooked but that one's bacteria just happened to latch on
Gonna do my taxes
exciting
grotongz
Hi
how are the taxes?
boring
sounds about right
so i got this wasabi seaweed from world market, and it is friggin delicious
done
yay taxes
brandoge
wanna do flash*2 + arrow tonight?
(at like 11, alex gets off at 10)
maybe
so android
I would like to reclaim my rice cooker
sure
sorry, was taking alex to work
okie
I'll come grab it in a sec
bueno
i'll make sure it's clean
WAR THunderrrrrrr
mmm rice and spam
yum
I ran out of crackers
so i moved on to water
you know it's bad when you have to resort to water as food
so what was your vector question?
oh, I finished the class I just wanted to see if you had any improvements to the design since you've done it like 10 times
lol
lemme pull up putty and i'll grab the code
oh, I forgot to overload the add and stuff
that's easy to do in python
yeah I just havent looked it up yet, I threw this together at like 1030 while i was half asleep
it's just something like def add
there are underscores there
stupid skype
well, it all looks fine to me. Just one style thing on divide
I typically put checks at the top (as in divide by 0) and print the error/return there, rather than nesting the rest of the method and printing the error at the bottom
That way the average level of indentation in my methods remains minimal
goddangit my laptop SSD boots to ubuntu so fast
I always have to try twice to get to windows
lol
alrighty, thanks :p
SONOFA it booted to ubuntu again
hehehe
scumbag laptop
yeah. once i finally select windows from the boot list it takes 5ever
o_O
I pulled my laptop battery earlier
when I booted windows it remembered exactly where I was
deco there's a japanese simulator event on :D
and even had the VM open still
lol
How did it manage that if I pulled the battery...
how long was the battery pulled?
A few hours
o.o
well then
I guess my laptop saves its state to the hard drive when I tell it to sleep
maybe vmware saved it's state to the drive
yeah
not just vmware, everything
that would be my guess
I didnt know it saved it to the actual hdd rather than just storing it in memory while sleeping
I thought ram was usually used for that, but I suppose it makes sense to do it to the hdd on a laptop
to save power
haha literally what I was saying :P
lol
import math
class MyVector:
x=0
y=0
z=0
def init (self, x, y, z):
 self.x = x
 self.y = y
 self.z = z
def str (self):
 return ("(" + str(self.x) + ", " + str(self.y) + ", " + str(self.z) + ")")

def add (self, other):
 return MyVector(self.x + other.x, self.y + other.y, self.z + other.z)
def sub (self, other):
 return MyVector(self.x - other.x, self.y - other.y, self.z - other.z)
def mul (self, scalar):
 return MyVector(self.x  scalar, self.y  scalar, self.z * scalar)
def div (self, scalar):
 return MyVector(self.x / scalar, self.y / scalar, self.z / scalar)
def norm (self):
 return math.sqrt(self.x*self.x + self.y*self.y + self.z*self.z)
pardon the big paste, too lazy to move the file out of vmware
that's my version
no prob
so you actually return a vector
oh, yeah
rather than just changing the calling vector
you typically want to return a new vector
although
sushil doesn't in his solution
he just returns self
which i think is the default behavior in python anyways
but I still think it's best to return a new vector
because you may not always want to change the input vectors
yeah, that way you'd just do vec = vec.add(newvec) to change the vector
yep
or vec = vec1+vec2
alrighty, that's why I asked
I thought I should probably return something like that, but wasnt sure if that was allowed in python or something
I had a tired reason for it
lol
of course it's allowed in python
lol
Python: where everything's allowed
basically
my laptop makes a super annoying very quiet and high pitch whining noise while it is powered down
at least it doesnt shine a light that spans the entire apartment even when it's fully powered off
that's what alex's old mac did
I practically threw it a few times
it has a tiny LED that isn't bright by anyone else's standards, but it is bright enough to bug me
now, my desktop on the other hand
it has an LED on it that is like a freaking lighthouse
yeah that's why I keep my bathroom door open at night
if I close the door, I can see the led
lol
but if its open then the led shines all the way through and doesnt bug me
sleeping with that door closed just seemed strange to me
i always left it and the closet door open
same
it feels like something odd could be behind them if they're closed
nothing overly scary
just odd
yeah like an axe murdere or something
lol
that's what alex would think
i'm more along the lines of "king cobra with his teeth missing"
lol
creepy, but not overly scary
an axe murderer with an aversion to blood and he has butter fingers
yum
and is canadian
butterfingers
i'd let him in
no butter fingers
btw i probably won't do flash/arrow tonight because i've more or less been awake since 6:30 and I'd like to sleep at a decent time
but you can watch them without me if you want
nah we'll wait
I figured it'd be too late
we'll just do em tomorrow
or something
okie
i actually have to go on campus tomorrow :(
gross
since I didn't go today
CS 326 turned in assignment #1 today, so I have to grab that
ah, that sounds like fun
more scheme
nah not yet
or was that just RE's
RE, grammar, parse trees/whatever
riiight
well if you need help just ask
a few short answer
I knew those things pretty well
lol
I have the answer key and my old homeworks
the rest I apparently didnt remember for the final but I knew before and after
lol
This Physics class, contains a reference to the entity that created an instance of this
class.
any idea what sushil means or how you'd do this in python?
yeah
so
you have an entity class, and the entity class will create an instance of a physics class
right
each physics instantiation will have a reference to the entity that spawned it
and be responsible for applying physics to that single entity
he calls them... something
uhh
aspects
yes
that's it
terrible name
how do I make the reference to the entity?
physicsObj.entity = self
in the entity's init function
or wherever
gotcha
He does a terrible job explaining what he means by the whole "aspect" concept
a solid 3/4 of the class did it wrong when I graded for him before
so the physics class has a variable called entity or whatever, and in the init for the entity I create the physics object, then set phys.entity or whatever to self
yeah
oh sorry, entity_or_whatever would be the variable name
Eventually you'll have a list of aspect classes defined in the entity's init, then a function to initialize all the aspects
gotcha
which is terrible
because that makes two instances of the "aspect" classes
yeah that seems wrong
but sushil didn't understand that when I explained it to him
but the point of that is so that you can iterate over the aspects list and call .tick on each
he also didnt understand when one of the students mentioned the fact that we could get into the solutions folder
lol
who mentioned it?
overheard after lecture, some indianish kid
Nolan? He's my group member and I pointed it out to him
idk if i'd consider nolan to be indianish
is he indian?
lol
his pic is up
pretty sure the kid was indian or something
nah not him
you are such a liar
lol
?
I enjoy web development and design
liessss
I do, just not professionally
lol
lol
inb4 job offer for webdev at microsoft or something
Well almost everything originate does is web based
true
eelke looks weird in his picture
yeah
I was lazy and made it so it only displayed correctly for images that are longer than they are wide
there was a better pic of him but it didn't fit that requirement
lol
I wish there was some way for me to see the other senior project websites
I want to snoop on the other groups
hax
not hax, just spys
real life wall hax
also..... WAR THUNDER(ftb)
INDEED WAR THUNDER
I tried, I think the minecraft issue still ahs not resolved itself.
The name server problem?
servers are good
indeed
actually one server is down
ah well then
I have a factory to build...I mean WAR THUNDER
YEAH EVERYONE KILL YOUR SHEEP AND WAR THE THUNDER
guys isnt communism great?
so great
I love my new comrades
they're so kind and they share everything with me like mother russia of old!
TT_tt
yeah we all love communism here
I KNEW YOU GUYS WERE COMRADES!
every single person in this chat
lol
yep
including and especially deco
lol
it worked
I always feel like the lone red soldier over here
Doctors - We all love communism!!!
hahaha
Doctors - Now only 99 cents a message!
lol
DAMN, that's 99 cents!
Damn, that's 1.98!
MOTHER FUCK
but shit, it was only 99 cents
I'll put the server up in like 10 minutes
or you could play war thunder
That's why it will be 10 minutes
curse your sudden but inevitable betrayal! -brandon and courtney
Taking my ki-10 to 6.3 BR
basically
I was on earlier but didnt see you
played a few of those yak-1 vs germans games
I'm not even planning on doing anythin on ftb, I just want to fly around and derp
maybe fill deco's base with deadly neurotoxin traps
that sounds like fun
or we could just use nether plasma
okay flying last mission
then minecraft
I can feel the TPS leaking from the server now
don't make me disable gascraft
you'd never!
it wouldn't be anything a well geared hazmat team couldn't fix
right? see it'd be totally fine
it's not like anyone has ever died to the gas
oh wait
we should designate an area of the server to straight up wwI battles
deadly neurotoxin florbs
bear traps
turrets
laser cannons
GRAVEL GUNS

I'm guessing i missed FTB
lol
that wasabi seaweed does sound delicious
minecraft doesn't make me eat like a stoner though
(unless it does?!)
man a half life movie would be amazing
lol
half life would be a good thing to play for the first time probably
so uhh
mincarft?
kreinmaft?
foodtehboost?
:F
ftbbbbb
i need to make my devilcraft room
wat?
wat
devilcraft has tempted me with its overclocked electric furnace
ohlol
so i am going to make a demonic themed room to house those devil machines
rofl
I am making my own little room for things as well
it'll be the first thing I've actually made on my mountain since before you guys joined the server lol
lol
how much you want to bet we lose power, andrew?
because it's windy?
yeah seems legit
yes
my lights have already flickered twice
ours havent yet
so
i'm bored
and alex is at work
me3
sounds like ftb time
deco
deco
deco
IAN
WAR THUNDER
communism is great
SHEEP'S BLOOD
war thunder
SWASTIKAS
hitler stalin swastika
lol
Doctors - Communism is our native language!
guyssss
it's not working :(
well, he isnt afchat playing war thunder
I checked
lol
it's only 5:36, he probably isnt home yet
yeah
sadly
we should play some war thunder
if by war thunder you mean ftb
I do, once deco gets on
but before that it's just war thunder
nah
lol
but so boredom
it's a shame deco's and my schedules are polar opposites atm
time to get ready for work
decooooooo
we really need a full time server
that would be nice
decosunnnnnnnnnnnnnn
I was in boulder city having dinner
Doctors - Better dead than Red
ftbbbbb
dunno
I don't think you guys want it
hahahahaha
its booting
nowwwwwww
wooooooo
thankssssssss
whereisandrewwwwww
waaaaaaaaat
There is a new modpack
whatis
looking at it
FTB Infinity
what's it called?
i c
its got everything but the kitchen sink
but that means no pam's harvestcraft?
lame
wait
it has phc
It has that
well then it has everything including the kitchen sink
nah kitchen sink is some weird nonsense going around the ftb community
I have no clue what it refers to
o.o
ok
llol

skedaddling to get alex and such
okie
speaking of alex, she doesnt work tomorrow so we could do arrow/flash
i am skyping with shannon again tomorrow night lol
well that's fine, we have the rest of the day :P
today's issue was alex worked night and you were going to the school
penistree?
No
Grandidlers Baobob

hi
hi
heil
HEIL!
ftb?
Hmmm
hmmm
Let me gauge for interest
hi
hi
okay server is up
Brandon Worl
Thomas Moore
Ian
it'll be back later
how much later?
after my dinner
lol
why you gotta turn it off? D:
Brandon Worl
Thomas Moore
Ian
sup peeps
deco turned the server off :(
fine
ohnoez
I'll resurrect it before I go
there
it should be okay
but it crashes
I'm not available for a couple hours
so be safe
lol
darkest dungeon looks really cool
watching stream of it atm :)
ziggy?
yup
nice
i'm waching the youtube series to catch up
lol
watched those
but I wanted more
so stream past broadcasts
aha
get all of em at once
gotcha
hi
hi
it's up
rejoining
hey brandog
hi
hi
so with the physics/entity interaction
I can't import both ways
so how do i have an entity reference in physics, and a physics object in entity?
uhh
what do you mean you can't import both ways?
it won't let me import entity in the physics file, and physics in the entity file
it should let you
Traceback (most recent call last):
 File "entity.py", line 2, in <module>
   from physics import Physics
 File "/home/unr.edu/amenard/a02/physics.py", line 2, in <module>
   from entity import Entity
 File "/home/unr.edu/amenard/a02/entity.py", line 2, in <module>
   from physics import Physics
ImportError: cannot import name Physics
you may not need to import entity in physics
ill try that
that probably worked
lol
havent made the main file to test it all yet, but I may be done
doubtful
but maybe
whelp, got it working
should the entities move a different amount each time you run the file if you use
for i in range():
and you just grab time every run of the for loop? I guess it would because it's not the only process running on their server
probably
also do xrange
not range
i'm just using his main.py file
which uses range
but I normally use xrange
for big things anyway
that was the reason for it wasnt it?
range makes  objects
xrange doesnt
yeah
ok
is there any time in which you would rather use range?
uhhh maybe
idk
lol
python is 1000 times more enjoyable to write than c++
it's just so intuitive
you read it and it makes sense
c++ isnt horrible that way, but python is just so clean
hey i'm running to jimboys to grab us some tacos, you want a couple? i'll drop em by your place on my way back
sure
okie
quanto?
uhh
that thing i usually get
the taco/burrito thing
the fiesta deal or something?
lol if they have no clue what i'm asking for, you want a nacho, a taco, and a burrito?
2 tacos 1 burrito i believe
no nacho?
nacho does sound good....
hmmmmmm
lol
decisions
nah just the tacos and burrito
okie, just ground beef for both?
yeah
sounds good
how're dem tacoritos?
delicious
bueno
dat burrito was ridonkulously good
I feel like my stomach is full of happiness and grease
certaintly full of grease lol

anyone hear of besieged?
yep
looked pretty cool
did
lol
I own it
been debating it
it does look like fun
just
early access
darkest dungeon also looks really good
but
early access
yeah early access :<
Hey Ian
ian ian ian ian
hi
CAn I halp you sir
You said you knew someone or something regarding blue man group, right?
Perhaps
I can see
Do you think you would be able to get me a good deal on two tickets on valentines day? lol
Uhhh probably not, I can't get them on holidays
ah, alright
If you wanted another day, probably but holidays are always impossible
Well sunday would also work
ooh this is a thing?
not asking now
just future reference
(that is neat)
wat
didn't know or mentally register that Ian knew blue man group peeps
I met the guy who designed the theater
that's the pun liking designer
lol
Any ideas for something fun to do on valentines day that isn't super expensive?
I'm already spending like $200 to fly there/back, so yeah. lol
uh
for Mai
I found out her favorite fast food place
(canes)
so we had a candlelit dinner of canes under a blanket fort
oh and I dyed her favorite flower her favorite color
and got her her favorite candy bar
but we're of a significantly different income bracket then you soooooo
lol
I should learn shannon's favorite flower
lol you should
this year we're just doing something Friday the 13th
But at this point if I ask it's kinda obvious that I'm just asking her what flowers to get her
and what is wrong with that?
idk
or
orrrr
or
well fuck
ask her family
if they're subtle
I have a feeling they aren't
I had a mutual friend ask Mai what flowers he should get his girl. Then he said, "well...what are your favorites maybe I can get her those?"
like he's smooooooooth
lol
....hm
and i don't really know her well enough to pull that
indeed
......................i may have an idea though
Well, it's valentines day, so roses are safe to go with
yeh
you could
oh look at what just popped up on my facebook feed
we do want to go star gazing, maybe in death valley (or that other valley, I always get them mixed up)
but probably not till it's warmer
well
you can't lose with ahome cooked meal
we've already got dinner reservations though
oh there ya go
so whatever we do has to be non food related
uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm does she like art?
yes
Bellagio gallery has Faberge eggs
which are like
rarer than Pokemon
+ other things, it's not only eggs
and it's cheap for locals
and students
your powers combined youa re discount man
lol
i know i spelled fabrege wrong
there's lots of galleries on the strip actually
Mai and I made a night of looking for all of them
we're waiting to hear on whether or not we can get a good deal on Zarkana tickets, but otherwise just exploring galleries could be a possibility
we didn't find all of them before our legs were jello
but
bellagio also has the conservatorium
it does
always purdy
there's alsoooooooooooooooo what was it
Aria
neat shops
cool to look at
giant shoes to stand in
or near
I remember the shoes
Cosmopolitan has art galleries
oh yeah and the gigantic friggin chandelier
make sure you make the lights go down as you enter the room like we did that one time
makes for an epic entrance
lol
pretty much use your imagination
make it about her, not the day
indeed
and honestly the little stuff counts as much as the big stuff
Also while I am in town do you want to do anything?
yus
oh also
dont' go full-ham your first valentines day
fun is better than expensive
Yeah, that's why I only want to go to a show if we can get a good deal lol
hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Giant shoes are at the Cosmopolitan
for valentines day maybe no
lol yes
Where do you have reservations?
Kona Grill
in henderson?
summerlin
Ah the rampart one
you don't even like sushi
it isnt just sushi lol
Does she like coffee?
ok they have other stuff neat
She doesn't drink caffiene
also she hates coffee
Is she mormon <.<
or was that her sister...
no
I know one of them hates coffee, lol
lol
wait what
what
what
?
ok good they're not mormon
right
lol
riiiiiiiiiight
Mai wishes you luck
you can still get hot chocolate
she likes whole milk hot chocolate
(gross)
kek
well hmm
boca park
go window shopping at the malls
there's an REI
talk about sportsy things or somesuch
make everything an adventure
or whatever you guys like
bungee jump off the stratosphere
She likes hiking
HELL NAW
also
^
she wants to go sky diving
. . .
which is also HELL NAW
ya no
i hear it's fun
and amazing
but no
Do indoor skydiving
I'll watch
lol
Considered it
there is a place on sahara
it's like $350 for 2 people with 15 minutes total between them
ouch
for that price I'd rather see a show lol
dude
food and rock climbing
We could
Basically if all else fails I think the backup plan is to just binge watch Sherlock
lol
BBC sherlock?
yeah
can't lose
so I enabled ads on my faction base tour video
and it has earned about a quarter
in around a week
how the hell do you make money like that on a video that's literally over two years old
lol
makin dem buckz
well, quarterz
I get like 4k views on that video per month still
soon to be buckz
you should put out an ftb tour once the base is more finished
eh, the base isn't that amazing compared to other ftb bases
well, there havent been many tutorials for functional things (like cake factories and other farming methods) so you could do stuff like that
I'm working on a cake factory now
that's what that room is gonna be
cake + culinary generator is apparently a viable power source
either that or that'll be the processing part, and the farms will be in the old spawner room
interesting
I saw that and was like "wat"
lol
lol
I tried it out in SP
it made like 240 rf/t for 40 seconds iirc
per cake
wow
not bad
I was gonna ask if you could help me get some of your AE mechanics to help process
either that or that remote IO thing
What kind of setup are you thinking?
we have wheat already
I need a way to craft the cakes, and bottle/bucket the milk
I have a sugarcane design ready
eggs are easy, just chickens on an AE materialization plane thingy
and eggs are easy
yeah
crafting cake is easy
it was mostly jsut sugarcane
lots of ways to do that
which I have a faster than normal design for
a hemp and sugarcane farm would be nice
idk if hemp works
my method uses ic2 crops
ew
why not just use an MFR farmer of some sort?
it's basically pam's, you don't have to break the blocks
you can use an MFR harvester on them
they grow faster than normal sugarcane
and they're cheap as hell
you can use a fertilizer from MFR on sugar cane
the harvester is the only MFR thing that interacts with sugar cane, I tested it
the fertilizer didnt work
Oh, the wiki said it does
yeah thats what i read too but it doesnt look like it does
__xxx
HxxxF
 xxx
was the setup I tried, and the harvester picks stuff up but the fertilizer didnt even use any of its fertilizer
i will test it real quick to see if i can confirm
I tried bone meal, fertilizer from ic2, fertilizer made from apatite, and industrial fertilizer from MFR and none of them got used on the sugarcane
Sugarcane cannot be fertalized
yeah, doesn't seem to work
yerp
#confirmedboys
gotta do large scale
nah
or sugar bees
ic2 crops + crop manager block thingy + harvester was really fast
only sad thing is you need ic2 power
for the crop manager
yuck gross
yeah
at least you can use rednet cable and rf
how do you plan on getting milk?
the... rancher? I forget the block name
from MFR
it can put it into buckets or grab it liquid form
just need a method of moving the buckets in/out for crafting
the MFR liquicrafter thing seems interesting
wassat
could be useful for you
it has internal tanks
any crafting recipe that requires a bucket of fluid will just pull from that fluid's tank instead
that seems awesome
that would be the way to go
I use those a lot
it'll craft 1 item when pulsed with a redstone signal
just stick a clock on it
it won't craft if the ingredients arent present
damn this makes milk super fast
the rancher?
yeah
yeah it gets 1 bucket per 10 seconds per cow
that seems wrong
this is very fast
that's what the wiki said
filled a 64 bucket tank in < 1 minute
how many cows?
with 4 adult cows and 1 baby
It will then collect one item per valid mob in the radius every 10 seconds (200 ticks)
maybe the info's outdated
but that should be about 40 buckets in 1 minute
when there's only 1 cow it seems to do 1 bucket per 10 seconds
could you hook a liquiCrafter up to the AE autocrafting?
yeah
that'd be convenient
Well, kinda
We'd just make the AE system keep the auto crafter stocked with materials
the actual crafting would just be done via redstone clock
gotcha
well, doable
and my place is pretty close to the AE system
set the cows and some sugarcane up down there, as well as chickens I guess
with 5 cows I am getting about 1 bucket per second
buggy? lol
either that or the wiki is wrong and there's a different formula than just 1/10/cow
ranchers can get eggs from chickens like that as well
force-poop!
i just stuck chickens in it and didnt get any eggs
maybe because the tank was full of milk
it has an internal inventory
it should have gone there
nope
internal inventory is empty
weird
try no cows/no milk
also it's doing 1 bucket of milk per 20 ticks
so 1/sec
that's pretty fast
yeah, no eggs still
interesting
maybe it just picks them up when pooped
for sheep they have to have wool to be sheared, so you have to have grass blocks
so it'd make sense that its not just cheaty "make item appear"
except cows
which should have a cooldown
well, for squid it seems to be 1 ink sack every 20 secondsish
nope, 1 per 10 seconds
aha
chicken dropped an egg and it grabbed it
cool
does it do that even when cows/milk are running?
it did it while the squid was there, so I assume so
that would be nice
could just stick a bunch of chickens and a few cows in front of one
yeah
2 for 1 ezpz whooptyfloopty razzleflazzle
poodin pop
lol
lol
imma go to bed now :P
ok sleep safe neighbor
drive safe neighbor
oh i will
lol
o_O
it also grabs feathers
weird
decoswan, le server?
por favour
decoswan pls
pls
pls
lol
so how bout that ftb eh
but I am test driving zee maus on the War Thunder dev server
new maus?
Maus
The germans super heavy tank
oh
lol
I am going to the store
but I put the server up
thanks
andrew go make cakes!
so I realized I have been calculating our progress towards how much magnetite we need incorrectly
We actually have 0.3% of our goal
abandon that goal
lol
these bacon bits smell like beggin strips
server is back up
so I saw
"it's kerbal space program for psychopaths" seems about right
10/10 I approve of that game
lol
that gif made me have strange feelings
God this class sucks
This whole homework assignment is just regurgitating words/definitions
lel
8 pages later and I am done! :D
... i just watched a 10 minute KSP video at 1 frame per second. The video was about a multiplayer mod and I thought it was just terrible and ran slow. Nope, just youtube being stupid. I alt tabbed and suddenly it was buttery smooth >_<
nice
what a happy ending
i like how I can tell almost every student found their answers to this problem by looking at stack overflow
?
grading stuff
also people who put way too much effort in to writing their answers are the worst
a bunch of these people are writing and entire page for question #1 and I only actually look at 4 lines when grading them
lol
this guy's name is "Thor"
hey i know that guy
he was in my 219 and 302 classes
lol
also besiege is awesome
grading these sucks
I bet
people are so bad at writing legibly
yeahh i'm guilty of that
wow I like how the swastika stays alive even though the rest of the machine burns
didnt notice that when I was browsing during engr comm
oh
it's pistons
duh
they dont burn
funny
it's been like 80 minutes, and I'm not yet done grading problem #1 out of 6 :<
yeah that class would have been hell to grade
you should see if he needs another grader and if he accepts students taht got a c in there :P
lol
I doubt it
yeah, me too
oh wellz
anyone want FTB?
I will if others do, otherwise I'll continue watching this movie
what movie?
Europa Report
wassat
Space movie
oh hey it's got crazy sector 9 guy
aka helicopter dude from A-team
aka bounty hunter from Elysium
I like him
Did we FTB?
Is Ian dead?
hi
i dont think so
although my movie just ended
Last I heard he ate rice and didn't vomit, but nothing since so maybe he actually did and died
Its ok, he's alive.
im ded
we'll need to plan a memorial service
damn, I never knew rice was so deadly
please
Have my funeral at Ricardos
And serve extra cilantro
We could just have a moment of silence here
that'd probably be good enough
i'd actually like to have ricardos
so that's my vote
yeah that's a good second plan I guess
a good FIRST plan!
mircea didn't really give partial credit on his hw, did he andrew?
But no cilantro?
extra cilantro
No cilantro.
the dying man request that cilantro be served in extra quantities
no one invited you to my funeral <.<
Exactly
will you really disrespect his last wish? his dying legacy, if you will?
Fine
Cilantro, lime, and avocado to celebrate my legacy
Ill pack a sandwhich
How rude!
how disrespectful
I will haunt you forever
ahah you want two dead people?
that's like bringing your own dead person to a funeral to mourne on the side
Im oddly ok with that
ok now it's no longer like that, it is exactly that
I meant the haunting, but the extra mourning I am also ok with
The haunting won't be plesant
I'll move your things to your sister's room
D :< you wouldnt
he already did
just take a look
spooky
dont worry you can undo it by just snorting a gram of cilantro
omg
so gross
just imagine how fresh that would smell
It'd be like fresh grass
and rainwater
with delishious
So much death
Why you want to poison me Ian??
WHY??
he is a time traveling spirit
he seeks revenge for the disrespect you will eventually show at his funeral
but it is, in fact, that revenge which leads to the disrespect. ooh spooky paradox
are they seriously doing another assassin's creed game right after unity flopped?
lol
$$$$$$
alllll the creeds
all the greeds
every assassin's creed game seems the same to me
just reskinned
hahahhaa
seriously
they arent even fun after an hour
popular user defined tags for this game:
walking simulator
pixel graphics
open world
Mediebal Engineers looks so fun
it does
So excited
it does indeed
I wish it had besiege elements in it though
those two combined
yum
It seems like it would
Its got a lot of mechanics
it has buildable physicsable things
like catapults and such
so you can make your own unique siege machines
yeah, I'm particularly fond of the flying category from besiege though
gives it a possibility of being airship-laden and awesome
everybody likes airships
flying in beseiged is like impossible
lol
well, it's the space engineers engine so they clearly aren't restricted by the engine for that
I have a successful helicopter and plane
you just have to set up usable controls
:F
although
I do, bit it seems limited
once they add the flipped aero-rotor it'll be way better
plus medieval engines probably will support steam workshop
so de vinci type machines will probably work
there's no way to make a counterbalance for the torque generated with propellers
Yeah
true
I have several flying things
they all die do to torque though
after about 2 minutes of flight
but idk, space engineers and medieval engineers just seem so "we're never finishing this shit"
yeah, my plane is the only one viable for long term
it can even land
space engineers gets weekly updates though
and has added tons of content at a consistent rate
if anything I'd say they are one of the few titles that actually look like they're going anywhere
#1 recommended review of besiege:
Tried to make a Trebuchet that fired a bomb.
Made a bomb which fired a Trebuchet
11/10
yeah they're adding content every few weeks, but it seems like there'll always be something to add
and not like minecraft something to add
how so?
more like something they need to add to keep going
how is that different than minecraft?
minecraft has been addictive and complete-feeling since beta
SE feels like it needs purpose
it's a sandbox game, they add more stuff to play with in the sandbox
minecraft is a released title
that's what I mean though, I don't think SE will get there
idk
maybe i'm just being picky
it will
lol
did you place MC in alpha?
most unfinished game ever
They add new stuff every thursday, and are getting close to the exploration stuff
for procedurally generated endless universes
and more dynamic encounters with AI
see once it has that I'll be excited
and yeah alpha mc was quite limited lol
alpha yeah, but when I joined in beta 1.8 it felt done
and then it went full release like two months later
but still
lol
this guys name is Quinn Jonas. There was a member of SG1 named Jonas Quinn. Coincidence? I think not.
lol
imma put the server up
i'll hop on in a sec after I finish grading these last few papers
just give them all an F
and move along
if only
only 4 left
macht schnell!
schmetterling
Schmetterling is schoun.
Aber du macht schnell, danke.
ugh this last one is bad
i have no clue what he was going for
Schwarzen Juden schlect?
just gonna assume it is wrong
alrighty, done grading problems #1 and #2
Fail him
This is basically the line of thought I see these students following: "{[(((PARENTHESIS) (EVERYWHERE(!!!))))]}"
one sec
crashed
k
deco what is this madness, I made a new acct and the Ki-10-II-C isnt anywhere on the research tree
Ki-10-IIC is removed
only old accounts have access to it
well then
that ruins my fun :P
Ki-10-IC is nearly as good
I was planning on seal clubbing with a brand new account since it'd have no bump up from skill
It turns better
yeah but it's not amazing OPness
It can still go 490km/h as a biplane
and climb at space level
any other planes that got removed like that?
I-15bis
one P-26
nah it's on there
i'm researching it
Really?
hmm
it's part of the I-15 group now
Maybe its the model-62?
They killed 1 I-15
model 62 is right after the bis
Did they get rid of one of the Furys or Nimrods?
there is one nimrod and two furies
Yup
They killed the Nimrod MkII
looks like
so they removed the best of two other countries
but still have the OP russian biplanes
thanks gaijin
guess it's a good thing I have an old account
I swear they removed one of the I-15 series
maybe
and a lagg I think
ahh yeah, there are only the lagg-3-8, 3-11, 3-35, 3-66 lol
And Po-2 of course
right
of course
cause
2-OP
#1bestingame
OH
And they removed 2 SB-2Ms
probably removed the air coberas because they were just too good
game breakingly good
amirite?
no
nope, N and Q still there
yeah, cuz merica
Ki-10 > P-39 series
^
nope
yep
p-39 is powered by freedom
go to space then follow you forever
space? try the moon!
Ki-10 > All not jet powered aircraft
you see the b29 and a new b57 with freedom cals are getting added?
I test flew them on the dev server
and Test drove the Maus
b29OP?
Honestly
at 6.7
wow thats a high br
it will be Ho.229 and R2Y2 food
yeahh
Also they gave the Ho.229 its Jumo 004 engines and fixed its wing rip
its amazing on the dev server
make a new account and seal club with me
sweet
that's exciting
So it looks cool
im close to being able to research it on my main acct
AND works
you should work on that instead of seal clubbing
I just need to be able to research and buy t5 planes
yeahhhh but I just get wrekt when I actually try
lol
They seem to have increased its research cost
Do you have Fw D-13?
yeah
My brother flew that exlusively for like 2 weeks and got the MiG-15bis (DDR)
ooh
iwo jima realistic event
It seems if you fly too high in Beseige your parts freeze and break
like ice freeze
they turn blue
just fly faster so the friction keeps you warm
uh huh
or shoot flames on yourself
Pretty sure that would cause more problems
yeah they do freeze
the increased the freeze height in the last update though
just tried making a rocket
three stages using cannon bursts
it...
didnt go well
boom
boom, boom, boom
it goes pretty high
but the final stage never stays intact
you have any interesting inventions?
define interesting
and invention
lol anything cool that you made
I don't think I have made anything particularly impressive
some of the things people make I'm surprised are even possible
like some of the walkers and transformers and stuff
pretty cool
gee thanks HipChat
whats hipchat
it's like a chat room for businesses/collaboration
We use it for our senior project
ah
hipchat is cruel
cruel hipchat
what's peeps up to?
styling pages with css
eww css
and building tables that are easier to read
being ill
for day 2
eww
imma play some war thunder I think
decoswan y u get off? :P
yay finished styling the pages I wanted to get done before our demo tomorrow
now, back to grading assignments
>_<
that sounds like so much (not) fun
there are very few funs in that plan
lol
i saw today that mr quinn jonas is running for VP
oh really
I have the power to break him! SO MUCH POWER!
i'm in a ton of classes with him
nice guy
never met him
he's a poly sci major but he's minoring in cs
his website looks nice though
wow
who'd he pay to get that done? lol
It uses a CSS framework of some sort
his cheeks are very overt when he smiles
makes it look weird
stupid people copying stupid people
that's what I am seeing
.... >_<
y stupid people copy stupid people, they should be like us and just be smart and "work together"
one guy afccidentally put T instead of R in his grammar (T is undefined)
but I could see that the first one originally was a T and he changed it to R and just forgot to change the last one
then this other guy (next one that was turned in) has T in his
haxcheatsbadongkillemall
._. so I may or may not have a cheaty copy of besieged
y u cheaty
its only 7
socheap
and so worth
wanted a trial first
lol
yeh, i guess
lol
the queens fodder mission is fun
yes indeed it is
so is the kill all sheep one
step one: put a sawblade on the bottom of your block
step two: put flamethrowers on all four sides
step three: ???
PROFIT
lol
wut
flaming whirlwheel of death
6 blocks used, 12 second victory
I just tried making a flying machine that works by flapping wings
It didnt work
lol
lol
I bet if I used gears and set something up like that it could work
I may or may not have used a spinning swastika with spike balls to try to beat that mission
didn't work
just kinda derped out
what on earth
ok
forgot my NSHE number (student id for college)
i click the button that says I forgot
"no security question set up"
ooook
gg
i gave them my birthday and email
seems legit
jesus
i know your birth date and email
i could steal your identity
me too

AP do you not have all chat on?
that one client wants more ads
like
ads in addition to the ads i've done
there's never going to be an endgoal with this
seriously
well, are you at least making money on it?
still "potentially"
haven't seen a cent
because it's still in developement
well that seems like a bad idea
lol
my philosophy would be 'If i'm working, i'm getting paid'
yeah after these ads i'm gonna give him a call and say that my life is moving at a fast pace and at this point i really can't afford to spend time on something that hasn't paid anything at all yet
sounds like a good plan to me. you enjoying what you're doing at least?
lol no not anymore
when i finaled out the 360 resources and sent in the first ads I thought I was done
ok bedtime for new job
night
night
hey brandog
well, when you awaken, would you mind taking a look at my entity class, I wanted a second opinion, since I'm not entirely sure it's working 100%
If I run his main multiple times in succession I get finishing positions from like 6 to 12, which seems to be a big difference
and the only difference there should be is the change in time between operations for their server (i'm running it via shell for now)
mc is up
hi
hi
i was skyping shannon, didnt see your message lol
gotcha, no problem
wanna take a look?
sure
Hola, I've returned from the land of no or slow interwebs
so this is a modpack that may be coming out sometime soon: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wKcVTd2CkCzjdhL6_U5k0w7zxF9I4UuTr9QA6fY_gOw/edit?pli=1#gid=0
no arse magic? D:
don't think they've gone 1.7
they have :(
but other than that one, I see a lot of mods that make me very happy
i want to first wizrod
i want this pack to be a thing
really bad
-chromaticraft-
it's an unfinished mod but has a lot of really cool stuff in it
iwant2ftb
redstone arsenal looks cool
it'll allow me to be an even bigger thermal expansion fanboy
i am sad 1.7 thermal expansion doesnt have ducts though
NO DUCTS?!??!?!?!?
HOW
HOWWWWWW
it's being moved to its own mod, which isnt released yet
boooooooooooooooooooooo
TE 1.7 has upgrades for machines though
so I can smelt fast without devilcraft
That makes the game unplayable without ducts though
yeah
lol
well, there's the extra utils transfer nodes
they arent terrible, but nothing is as good as mah ducts
those and BC pipes suck though
compared to ducts
everything sucks compared to ducts
finished grading! now I just need to tally up the scores and enter them into a spreadsheet
this guy got a 57%. he was in a group project of mine before. He was useless. TAKE THAT USELESS GUY!
lol
hi tony
do you feel like red rocking on sunday?
uhh
this sunday?
maybe
yesh
what trail and when
ice box and whenever probably not super early
mmmmkay
mai can come too, shannon will be going
h'okay
lol
i was bringing her anyways
i assumed as much but figured I'd say anyways
lol
i appreciate it :D
yayyyyy all grades are entered
now I just need to get these papers back to him before 9:30 tomorrow D:
lol
oh so
the company that needs to pay me
that hasn't sent the tax form
they're saying I'm gonna get taxed for 891.50 more than what I have been paid
so like
uhhhh
i don't know what to do
find someone in charge, knock them out, seran wrap them to a table in a shipping container off somewhere inconspicious, and then make them realize their wrongs
and then stab them in the chest
ok ok
got any serious responses though or perhaps a resource or advice
no clue
fuck ok
holy crap
this guy assigned 42 problems for our next homework
the last one was shorter and took like 9 pages
it was like half as many last time
and it's due tuesday x_x
lol surprise mufugga
ok you know what wow
she paid me in cash
so there's no paper trail
and she's going to make me pay the taxes for that extra $891.50 because I can't prove that she's wrong and I'm right
fuck her
with a rake
pointy side up
I'm raging so hard right now
Did I hear red rock?
bread rock
ohhhh
ok
After further reading I realised I would not have a date and become the fifth wheel, so I won't attempt to invite myself
lol
lol you can come if you want
I would still be the fifth wheel lol
lol
you gonna host ftb today?
sure
it lives
i have to make sure my base can survive my absence for a few days while I'm in vegas
and also make more chemical weapons
75.142.240.234
has logged in
indeed
socket write error :(
well at least it isnt a socket read error
then you'd have a real problem
hi
hi
so andrew do you think you could possibly maybe drive me to the airport tomorrow? :D
what time?
my flight leaves at 9:25 pm
sure
thanks
yep
server is rebooting
I need to borrow your villager trade machine
to test this
ok
lololol
so in alex's class
one kid wrote "even though the bill of rights is over  years old"
umm
no
lol
probably a typo but still hilarious
uhhh yeah, it's the year , America has had  birthdays
alex says since my crazy nonsense dude didnt make a discussion post this week, she got one instead
server is still up

the fertilizer I made
it no wok
It has to be ic2 fertilizer
which requires scrap
and bone meal
yuck
yeah
lame
bone meal isnt bad
scrap is also easy to make but it is still yuck
yeah
bombs are fun in that game
I made a nuke truck like from Red Alert 3
or was it 2
which one did we play a lot brandon?
2 then
but yeah it's a cool looking truck
is that the game where you put c4 on people and they freak the hell out?
super laggy because it's massive
nah
RA2 is an rts
I need to find out what game that is because I need to see said freakout
lol
welp, i am going to go to bed
okey
goodnight
night
nobbles, about bread sock hike
should we invite others or just keep it us 4
oh also
I told my client I wouldn't be able to work on future advertisements and details for him beyond what he's already asked
fastest response I've ever gotten from the guy
what'd he say?
he's saying i've left him in a predicament becuase now he needs to find someone to fulfill our agreement
lots of passive aggression
as if everything isn't already made
i asked him what other promo items did I need beyond the stuff I've finished
no response yet
interesting, sounds like the guy's a bit of a turd
oh yeah
total bro lol
lol
but ya know, 200+ hours at $0 pay
kinda tiring
yeah that doesnt sound like a good deal
still no response
boy howdy is he maaaaaaad
i think he's thinking about firing me
lol
if that's the case i'm gonna need a lawyer
because i met my end of the deal
yeahhhh thats some shit, you have all of it documented?
i have the contract, I have emails, I have digital files
i don't know what else i should document
that seems about right. maybe hit up your school's law department and ask them
...i'm out of school :<
no i know
.....i don't think csn has a law dept.
really?
interesting
Either he's waiting for revenue or he's going to file for bankrupcy.
?
Time to send some collection letter
letters that is
oh no i know the product hasn't made money yet
it's one of those "get on the ground floor" things
free now, paid later
5% of profit
i went into thsi fully aware of that
hmm
i simply said "hey dude I've delivered everything and I have living expenses, I can't afford to spend more time on this after i complete what you requested"
insert passive aggression
yeah, well legally he'd still owe you what you were contracted for so even if he does "fire" you it wouldnt make much difference
Yes, sounds like can't pay you yet
^^^
not gonna be able to for another 2 or 3 months
app is in development
not much you can do about that either way though, even if you did continue working
yeh
i gave him my word and I'm good for it
but he needs to stop adding things on and on and on and on and on
Maybe you should ask him for a percentage of the bill in good faith? Otherwise not sure what options you have than a collection agency or lawyer. Both cost money
i'm sure if it really came down to it a guy who isnt willing to or can't pay because he's funding a startup would be willing to settle without lawyers
we'll see
gotta go to work
o/
wish me luck
adios, gl
i'll let you know if anything develops
coo coo
vgb
 vgtg
vgca
hi
hi
so ed gant posted this week
and holy fuck
he posted a massive wall of text
vgh
like seriously an essay
and it's semi legible this time
i received important tax information from PF Changs for Jesse Flores in my mail today
still tons of grammatical errors
do wat
lol
thats what i'm wondering lol
if this is important should I send it back or something?
pf changs huh
lol
idk, i'd probably ask the office what they'd do with it or something
sounds like a good idea
so
last night
I plugged my phone in, and it said it was charging
but something must have been running in the background like crazy, because the battery level dropped quite fast despite being plugged in
and therefore my phone died at 4 am
o.O
oh dear god
an excerpt
But Mr. fly was defiant did not ask for anything not even the values of Christianity one thing he did wish for that all masters of vessels might take warning by the fate of the captain Capt. Green that he had murdered and to pay sailor their wages then do. Bad Usage. William fly Times Roman blew his sail beneath the Jolly women who turn pirate call attention to their conventions of gender and all people who turned pirate and sealed under their own dark flag the Jolly Roger enacted a highly political play about the nation. Pirates  do not consider themselves as common robbers.
woke up at 10:20 and realized my phone was dead (but charging)
Bad Usage.
Times Roman
wat
it sounds computer generated
bad usage is a quote from the book, but yeah I agree it totally sounds computer generated
But if you read some of the other stuff its 100% not cg
i just google searched the first chunk of that and the first result is the full text of Mein Kampf
there's no way (unless he has an analytical text for the book we read) he could make some of the inferences that he does
lol mein kampf huh
yup
it's all stuff from marcus rediker's villians of all nations
wait
wtf
oh nvm
thats someone else
somebody mentions nazi germany and soviet russia
lol
History has a record of dictatorships only breeding more crime as a means of survival, one thinks of Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, though such governments have been known to cover up their crime or at least the causes and reasons for the crimes.
lol
new nightwish song comes out tomorrow :DDD
ooh nice
lol that full text of mein kampf was only matching the non-important words, not like nouns and verbs and stuff
Oh tony's gone
I was gonna say
I know like 6 good lawyers
only half of them worked for the mob
lol
that half is probably the better half
i think my phone's battery is bad
because it's already back down to 15% and I've hardly used it
sounds like a baddery
indeed
I really want the compact machines mod Etho has in his modded SP
it's like a ready-made cube for me to build in
lol
what does it do?
I watched the first episode of that series
havent gotten to the rest yet
it's a block in the world, but if you use a shinkafier or whatever, you can go inside it
and it makes a dimension that is like 16x16x16
with an input/output port in the middle of each side
so you can build a bunch of machines inside it, but when you go back out it's all in a 1x1x1 area
and iteract with the inside via pipes
that's awesome
._.
whoa
so you could compact an entire autosmelting+doubling setup or something into one block
yeah
Can you put and ME system in your ME System?
those are available in this HQM mudpack im playing right now but I didn't know what they did
and move said block around
*modpack
that's amazing
I need them
Put an ME system in your ME system in your ME system
lol
lol
i'm guessing that wouldnt work
can you put them inside themselves?
dunno
i'd assume no
Go to the 11th dimension
lol
We heard you liked blocks so we put blocks in your blocks
and we let you put blocks inside of them too
so im using steve's factory manager for the first time right now
it's interesting
wassat
a programmable block that does everything pipes do and more
oh that's right
I remember that
I can see nao getting really into it
lol
it can also do redstone pulsey stuff
apparently it can also automate an AE grindstone
I assume it should be able to
sounds OP
it's not bad
just starting it up seems a bit awkward
Hopefully i'll join you guys tomorrowind
(Not human centipede join)
But I didn't think you'd think I would xD
Don't mind me I just need sleep.
lol
mentos' momentos
i'm taking you to the clairport tonight right brandquelin?
yeah
yeh man i see you at the clairport nomsayin
also i think it was FB messenger that killed my phone battery
damn facebook
so apparently it is physically impossible to drown in penicillin in this modpack
the healing is too op
uninstalling messenger made my eta to full charge drop by 11 hours
._.
19 to 8
seems about right, facebook just breaks things
dropped by 15 hours now
FTB is up
woo
ohai
hello
update if you cared: I sent him a message that made him suddenly professionalize-up
so yeah
nice
oh also to answer your earlier question about the hike: just us
basically told him that according to all of our electronically recorded messages that he was happy with how above and beyond I went and how timely I was.
And his passive aggression stopped.
God I love written things
okey doke brandini
if you were an instrument you'd be a  Brandolin
well, i like the violin
so thats fine with me
you're not violent
you'r emanly
Mandolin
Brandolin
also
for SF
heyyy i've had ike's before
they do have good sandwiches
lol
so i downloaded and looked at starmade today
it looks pretty cool
lots of new stuff
including a cool tutorial
hm
Ian you might like this:
I've been watching it
It seems cool, but
early access
yeah
cool that it focuses on the economics of it though
so guys
i made their logo
also for brandini/tony: the less-than-mainstream rock radio station in reno has been playing drop dead cynical by amaranthe for a few weeks now, and the super mainstream one played it today with a version that basically removed screamo dude and replaced him with cool-hat-wearing-european(swedish?) dude
nice logo
lol
the content of that video is...
interesting
lol
...huh
lol
my favorite part is like the last 10 seconds
they're pretty funny
lol they're great guys
video is meh quality though, which is a big deal on youtube
honestly the editing was far better than I was expecting
like
vs. "Game Grumps" it's a lot better
yeah the editing is pretty good
just the fact that I can see the pixels for most of the characters and stuff
ah
well
GC
which is tough to fix if they're recording from a card on a gc or wii
yeah
they'll be doing focus on boardgames too
interesting
kind of like an Extra Credits but with boardgames
history, types of boardgames, etc.
that sounds unique and interesting
hi
like, escape from colditz the boardgame?
dunno
IT IS GIF END OF STORY
if you have to change its spelling to write the way you think it should be pronounced, you are wrong
counter arguments about the countless words that are pronounced differently than they are spelled do not count
CIVIL WAR
toxikk is up for early access on the humble store
amaranthe is doing a headliner NA tour in a few months :D
for who?
they are the headliner
oh
nice
gonna see them in LA probably
did you see what I said about drop dead cynical minus screamo-dude?
yeah
thought that was pretty weird
lol
it sounded so different
i dont mind screamo-dude most of the time
yea me either
i just hope they have their audio right this time lol
yeahhh that was kinda bad
lol
sooo loud
and 0 volume on elize's mic
yeah
so i tried installing py-ogre on my vm
nope
how much ram does the vm have?
the script ran, but it failed like 90% of the stuff it tried to do
it's a vmware player so only like 1gb
you need like 4 gb to compile ogre
there's a way around that
might work with 1gb
it's hidden somewhere deep in my email history
their script was supposed to work around that I thought
nah
you have to edit an ogre thing to change the compiler flags
ah
im probably just gonna try and get a copy of my vm at the ecc
that explains how to set the optimization flags
gotcha
I had ricardos last night
yum
the maus looks like fun
deadmaus
notdeadmaus
wow: http://imgur.com/a/fNC3o/layout/horizontal#0
pretty big
3 much work
brandon when hike
text me or whatever
FTB is running
if anyone is here or interested
its down
needs more RAM
I have more coming
by tuesday
its back
the server that is
so I'm discovering the pain that is being a self-employed freelance designer during tax season
WHERE IS YOUR W2?????
hm?
w2 1099 misc, 1040 EZ, 1048 if i miss the 1099 misc
SE
T_T
hi
hi
greetings
greetongz
greentongs
vgh
vgh
nao you get the stuff
nope
doesnt work if you arent online
oh wait
it started once you got online
k
think i caught a few neat ones
herro
hallo
i am back in the land of cold
brr brrr
Good thing you have proper mittens
lol
apparently a vanilla mob spawner placed on cursed earth always spawns, regardless of player distance
o.O
vgh
vgh
vgh
Everyone ok?
vgy
vgy
Server address changed?
vgca
it's only up when deco hosts
^
sadly
Ah, herr deco sleeps :O
Well "sleeps"
he'll probably be at work for the next 4-5 hours
In other news. I've picked up a new hobby, started learning Ruby.
Yeah that's what I meant by sleep :P
Ruby is wonderful :D
My entire senior project is written in Ruby
Just takes practice, and learning the possibilities.
Had some C in highschool, but but don't remember most of it, been so long.
c is gross, ruby is yum
I love ze future!
lol
Should be fun
24Gig of RAM
woo
o_O
wat
that's a lot of ram
It is
now I can give 4gigs to the MC server
so it won't be so unstable
ish
and I can run VMs
like 5
at the same time
i think next time we should do a custom pack
so it can be more stable
How do we do dis
I still want IC2 in the pack
apparently it's super easy with 1.7+
we need ducts to update
Ender IO ducts seem better honestly
I still want regular ducts
since Ender IO takes more to make
but yeah, now that block IDs aren't able to conflict, it's much easier to make mod packs
OH thats right
we could build a really fun pack
I forgot about that
yeah
RF Tools looks cool
there's a lot of cool mods I've never used
and since I clearly have the ram we can just add tonnes of crap just to have it
you gonna host ftb tonight?
yes
its up
okie
NOW WITH 4G of RAM
i'll hop on after I figure out how to log in to this email account
yayyyy i got it
hi
hi
lots of etho's pack is derp in multiplayer sadly
but i'd be super happy with a custom pack
also hi
hi
hi
brandog do you know if originate is going to be at the career fair?
uhhh
not sure
didnt hear anything about it
gotcha
I'm going to attempt to actually land interviews for either summer or full/part time internships
I feel confident enough in my coding/learning ability finally :F
lol
so
I think i just found a fluid duplication bug
wat is?
wat
I want to see
not sure what's causing it
lol server up time
wat
you said you wanted to see
so i figured you'd be putting up the server
server is up
yo android
yessir
when do you want to do arrow/flash?
probably later this week
yes but what day were you thinking?
fridas
Ok, shannon and I are gonna skype Fridas but we can probably make it work
okey
alex gets off work at 6 (starts at 10) that day so that's why she was thinking it'd be good
we could make burgers or something, I have patties and buns and stuff
exciting stuff coming up in space engineers
hey guys
why are mountains so funny
guys
it's because....
they're hill areas
hill areas guys
because they're hill areas
-_-
YEAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
x_x
lol
X_X
XX_XX
so hi
hello
hi
what is up
I am fixing HORRIBLE grammar for this paper due tomorrow
for senior projects?
yeah
lol whose grammar is horribad?
never again will I let my group members write this stuff
both of them
like 5th grade level grammar here
I bet they're saying less rather than fewer
if only that was the only problem
lol
ZERO word variety, awkward sentence structure, there would be a ton of spelling errors if not for spell check
sounds like they're a bunch of inner city kids
lol
although, those kids don't have speel chec becuz they don hav e no computatorz
woah, ministroke there, sorry for the spelling
hi
i kind of want to go hiking again
Mai apparently was very very sore from that
my theighs were sore for 2 days afterward
...
my calves were a little sore
I'm sure Shannon didn't feel a thing
she rarely sat during rest points. she SQUATTED
like
BURNED MORE CALORIES
lol
she said her feet were sore, but that's because she wore heels for 2 days after the hike
she goes to the gym though, which probably helps to not feel sore...
oh yeah that helps a lot
well we could hike again in march when I'm back :D
i'm down
you guys see that link i messaged earlier today? About space engineers updates
yeah
a reread/reiteration of what was said
yeah
so like...
what's that word
not conceptualispeculation
speculation
planets, oxygen, threaded physics, new networking library, graphics LOD optimization
nice
and it wont just be disk planets like in starmade, it'll be spherical procedurally generated planets that are hundreds-thousands of km in diameter
well that's fucking epic
I think having oxygen will really add to the atmosphere of the game
BA DUM
TST
lol seriously though that's fucking great
guh also
days go by too fast with a full time job
blargh
starmade isnt flat planets anymore
they're like octohedrons or something like that
decoswan ftb?
sure
woo i have to test my fluid duplication idea

vgh
vgh
vgh
i want to go home but I have to turn in homework at 2:30 :(
vgs
gross
I have class at 1
which is also gross
I want to ftbbbbb
I want to build a new base
I want to ride my bicycle
no, you want to build a liquid production facility
basically already did
lol
I want to make a new base that takes advantage of that though
we need a new pack
We need a new pack after Thermal Dynamics is released
wassat?
ducts
ah
nobody needs ducts
just use extra utils
Ender IO has good alternatives
but still ducts
i like ducts
lol
i'm guessing they help you make liquids in a less than fully reputable manner
I highly doubt that bug still exists
yeah probably not
but still
I just want to build a big warehouse
my current square is too small
also infinite destabalized redstone + redstone generators = easy power
my next 219 homework only has 8 problems
that's a hell of a lot better than the 40-50 that were on the last one
yeah that's a bit ridiculous, ours wasnt nearly that many
yeah this guy sucks
does his homework at least make sense?
people are turning in 20 pages for their homework
20 frreaking pages!
yeah thats just dumb
yeah
Mine is usually like 5-8 pages
because I don't show most of my work
lol
bleh
it isn't super hard stuff
I already know how to do most of it
still takes time though
Also I may have found the answer book online for a previous edition
see ours was like two pages of ridiculously ambiguous questions which we havent ever talked about except for like one slide for five minutes in lecture
that has almost all of the same problems
i don't pay attention to the lecture
that's my 75 minute reading time
reading unrelated fiction
I just google it or look at the book
lol
the guy has an accent and speaks at like 77349 words per second
yeah with ours you couldnt google it, looking at the book wasn't much help, and if you didnt crowdsource it then you'd never figure out if you actually got it right
eww accent
yeah
aint nobody got time for accents
the first homework also had a billion problems and he's like "i dont know what's taking the grader so long"
lol
There's always one master and one apprentice (devil)
Ment on Teachers/Professors
Medieval Engineers is available
yep
gonna buy it
probably
meh
imma wait
hi
hi
ftb? :D
in like 20 minutes sure
ok
i will get food in the mean time
I have that location ready for the new base
ok
will i be able to build myself a warehouse at this new location?
Define warehouse
a rectangular single floor largeish building
for what?
idk
lol
i just want a clean work area with lots of room
We could put it on the ocean floor
brb food
back
so anyways, what was the idea behind this new building, again?
Well we can put your lab/warehouse under water
I want to put the majority of the base all jetsons style in the sky
at like
170 blocks
also isnt liquid yellorium a thing?
because if it is we could just build a stupidly large big reactor and have infinite fuel for it
I think jet fuel is probably the most efficient power supply to size ratio
probably
12k RF/t per 5 blocks
lol
good deal right there
Has the ip changed?
turning it on right now
i dont think it's up yet
its running
I've got 72.193.109.49
that's correct
wish me luck guys
ah now I see it
I have to edit my windows registry
good luck
this may be a minute
alrighty
oooooook
so its done
got to love windows registry
what were you doing with your registry?
Moving my Appdata folder and all its contents to another location
ah
i swear my upstairs neighbor is dragging grand pianos around
How can you tell?
the constant sound of heavy things being dragged across the floor
Feng Shui Major
lol
maybe its the dead bodies of sumo wrestlers
a sumo wrestler would make a more muffled sound
FTB is working
Brandon Worl
Ian
I'm going to get some sleep
g'night all
night
you're getting new upstairs neighbors brandon, they're unpacking furnature
oh
lol
saw them when i drove past
Brandon Worl
Ian
GODDANGIT
i forgot to push my git branch
....
looks like I'm going on campus tomorrow
gg
i even remembered specifically to take care of my branch before i left the lab
i made a branch, added my changes, committed it...
and then just forgot to push it to origin :(
ouch
funnily enough, I still have no idea what most of that means
ftb infinity looks awesome
lots of really cool mods
how hard is it to email a working scheme file? jeeze
over half of these don't even load correctly
sounds like a collaborative effort to get extra time
haxxx
nope
i think it's from people using other scheme things
other than petite chez
ah
I have to go in and fix all of their errors on petite chez to get them to run
or they email me a .pages file which only works on mac
in which case... idk what to do
i'd let him know and make sure they're using petite chez and sending non-mac only files
some people just dont email anything at all!
the ecc is available for them
lol
well those people are out of luck
one of them hardly did any of the assignment
so I just typed their 3 functions into petite by hand
they got like 20%
but these other people have full submissions and no email
and I don't want to type all that by hand
ANOTHER NO EMAIL?!?!?!? BAH
yeah that sounds like "send me the right stuff next time or you get no grade or a way worse grade"
ermagerd
i dont get it
it says very clearly to turn it in by email
these people went through the trouble of writing correctish-looking code and then didnt email it
lol
whatthefuck
another one
I have a feeling people are stupid
that's a fact not a feeling
o_O
he printed his submission on like.. resume paper
I feel like there should be a penalty for not turning it in correctly
lel
is it scented?
no
lol
well if it was maybe he would have gotten some extra credit
no
any deviation from the norm just annoys me
if anything i'd take points away!
any deviation from the norm really should be penalized
in every other class it is
"your paper smells funny -3"
"your thick resume paper gave me a paper cut -50"
lol
if he had an email submission he wouldnt have had that problem
yay go zach cooper! your code ran without any tweaking and functioned correctly! 110% 11/10 would grade again
goddammit saharath why couldn't you keep the trend alive
quinn jonas didnt email, he just lost my vote for vice president
not that I would have voted anyways
and he seemed like a stickler for details
welp
just imagine what a mistake like that would cause as VP!
novp4him
yeah
homework today, the entire faculty tomorrow!
lol
lol
so board
much beard
wow
i am bored too
i am taking a break from grading
whar server go
it went over there
oh hey
I see it
why don't we bring it back
ask decoswan
well I would if he was here
but I think he flew away
sometimes he just feels like the ugly duckling and migrates south for the winter
oh hey
frozen synapse has a new sequel out
called frozen cortex
its "Turn-based NFL Blitz with robots."
lol some guy just asked me how to make my cursors.io hax draw a different image
the version everyone else has only draws dickbutt
lolol
"just keep drawing, eventually it changes, it's a random chance"
feel like playing some coop portal 2?
i dont think i have it installed
sec
I'm installing it right now
same
oh it's kinda big
6gb
6.6 even
6.6.6 even?
1gb down
and now my internet is crying out in pain
lol
my web browser no longer browses the web
I think jared might be asleep or something already cause mine is fine :F
well, at least it still semi-functions as a pseudo-operating-system
my internet dies under any form of moderate bandwidth usage
yeah cant even browse reddit
lol
oh noes, what has the world come to!?
my download has ~ 2 hours left according to steam
meanwhile i'm watching a stream, browsing reddit, and at 3gb done already
im at 741 mb....
:/
:/
this all happened when charter "doubled" my internet speed
and how did they go about doubling it?
idk
i got a call that said they doubled it
lol
o.O
im guessing they did speed = speed / 2 instead of speed * 2
easy mistake to make really
maybe
or they forgot to mention that it only doubles when running speed tests, ,and it actually runs at 5mb/s down when you're using it
oh apparently I'm only at 360 mb so far
huh
i'm halfway
7m left
113 minutes left
We just need a 500ft ethernet cable
so I can hop on your network for a few minutes
we just need google fibre
if only stupid existing isp's weren't so limiting to google entering the market
it's like they think they'd lose all their business
well, while this downloads I might as well go shower
lol
we're probably not going to end up playing tonight
probably, at this rate lol
but we'll have it installed
6.1/6.6
done
anyone want FTB?
sure
okay
putting it up

hey brandoge, so what's the plan for tonizzle?
(tonight)
(clarification because i've used tonizzle to speak to tony before)
[brandoge is not here yet]
{I will wait}
hi
hi
turns out I DID push my branch
lol
I just didnt see it
did you go to school anyway?
yes
ouch
i got there and saw that my branch was on github for the past 22 hours
lol
anywho
shannon and I are gonna skype at some point, but she won't be home till 6:30
hrmm, okey
so
when should we do arrow/flash, and would you want to join for burgers?
uhh
when was alex getting off of work?
hmm
indeed
Shannon is probably gonna eat and stuff when she gets home so idk when we'll actually skype
indeed
lol
gotta love Teal'c
indeed
so, if you skyped shannon at like... 9, that would work out pretty well
we could get two episodes and burgers fit in if you did it at 9
ok
I'll see if that works for her
wat
the girl who got the lowest score on assignment 1 turned in her HW2 printed on the back of random sheets of paper
like
the cover page is printed on the back of a printer test sheet
the other pages are printed on the backs of a random CS 477 assignment
o.o
finished grading all the submissions that were emailed
15 people didnt email... >_<
that's a quarter of the class
grading? teaching?
grading for CS 326 (Programming Languages)
ah nice
portale?
hi
i was at winco
oh my god this yocrunch m&m yogurt is so good
why have I not been buying boxes of this every time i go to winco
lol
it's so hard for me to resist eating the other 5 that are in my fridge
okay so i'm going to get alex now, flash/arrow/burgers when I get back?
yes
coo coo
gratuitous space battles 2 looks fun
Derkters
hi
gsb2 has a bunch of things wrong with it still
like, things that mods for gsb fixed, and they still haven't fixed them in this newer version
also you can head over, and if you have any could you bring some ketchup?
also brandon is so cool
i just can't believe how cool he is
Actually I think Alex is the coolest
the coolest ever
and i mean EVER
brandons lame
Alex is pretty cool, she has the greatest cough out of all of us.
was
my dnd group just died :(
what killed you?
Two players decided to call it quits in the last battle of our campaign. And we just cant win unless everyone played because its very intense. So. The DM wiped the whole party.
basically, a 50 000 year old super-human manipulating the spirits of the dead in the name of the king of the gods to destroy the world
interesting
I would have just chopped his head off
1/10000 chance to work but I always win
(totally kidding, I've never played DnD)
Nah he would have just dodged it
its what made him so difficult
dodged most things with ease and had attacks that were deadly and hard for us to defend or dodge against
AoE damage him then?
I think space engineers should be a game we play again soon
The only one who could was me
but I a) couldn't get in range without being one shot killed
b) did so little damage it wasn't even
:/
c) was too gay too fight
pfft
Basically the dm just decided not to play anymore, came up with a story about how our last enemy killed us all one by one simply by overwhelming us
anyone up for minecraft?
Namely Brandon
who may need to fix things
with me
Brandon
I think I solved your ME system issue
hi
or at least figured out why it keeps crashing
is the server up?
yes
i'll hop on
will ftb be up much tomorrow?
should be :D
ok, I'll get to work on making a new nice crafting system in the basement place then
hi
hi
hello
WELL MET
MELL WET
WELT MEL
well fine then
WELM LET
whatcha doin?
grading these last 15 submissions by hand
because no emails
almost all of them have been 100% too
except for the 25% penalty for no email
oh good there is a penalty
I was gonna be seriously confused if he said it was fine
9 more to go
>_<
9 mas
uno mash
actually one of those was the answer key lol. so only 8
lol
wow
instead of just doing "else" this guy does "equal 1 1"
so that it'll always be true and branch there
o.O
well
I guess it works
but
you know
that's weird
it's like saying if (thing) { } else if (true) { }
lol
if(halo) else if (true) huh?
lol
a, actaully
not halo
lol

well yeah
lol
i don't care enough to do anything about it
lol
done grading :D
noice
ftb deco?
sure
one minute
its booting
server or just me?
me too
It wasn't me >.>
ftb y u bork
i blame the quantum tunnle
that portal kills me everytime
the portal from the new place to your base kills me sometimes too
portals so buggy
crashed on log in
of so fun
deco i am totally out of gold now :(
I can send you gold
Also everyone should know tesseracts are allowed now
do not sell essance to him
lol
porque no?
He's under embargo
lol
by us
aah
he's a part of the "enemy"
we could sell him "essence" and "accidentally" swap it with deadly neurotoxin
lol
The problem is he wants to use it for his spawner
to make pink slime
which is currently a cornered market
so we have to keep it that way
lol
start the call?

seems you dropped
Brandon Worl

ending the call didnt seem to help
>_<
nope
Lets take a break for a bit
k
i will go eat then
lol
kk
hockey event much less fun than I thought
you can bring jets
and there is no tiering
so it's the one or two guys in jets seal clubbing everyone else
my internet is crap >_<
charter was here earlier today, shoulda yelled at em
Did someone say jet party?
no tengo jets
I was the only person on my team with any skill as well, since its arcade
I should bring MiG-15 and CL-13
everyone was derping around chasing jets, and I ended up being the last alive against a guy in a sabre
Do you get multiple spawns?
you don't really want cannons
yeah
why no cannons?
mg's reload 10000x faster, and you have to hit the flying arado puck to score
unless you're just going for kills
but going for the puck was more fun
multitasking
oh and it takes a few hits on the arado to get it moving your way
which is why no cannons is better
sabre OP
mg sabre that is
I had quite a bit of success with the mg bearcat, but eventually a ta152 oneshot my wing
hi
my internet appears to have recovered now
oh?
oh oh

I tried some things and its still derp
still no luck?
you foos are ftb addicts :F
says the hearthstone addict
FTB
hey, I never said I was any better
lol
lol
I almost have navigational breadcrumbs set up for my entire senior project
Our new place generates around 380k rf/t though
and has a much nicer AE system than the old base
._.
how?
magic
32 minutes and i can check it out... proveded the server was up >.>
lol
did it boom again?
yeah
we think it is related to gascraft
deco was trying to pass gas, and I was just pulling items out of an ME terminal
ooh cool, a guy from Google is gonna do a tech talk in my senior project class on March 3rd
nice
this guy capitalizes everything like zipperdude
now that you said that, I won't be able to enjoy the video
the mods used on that ship are pretty cool
that ship is sick
yeah, it looks really cool
but on top of that it seems functional lol
greetings doctors
Good day sir
paging Dr. Decoswan. Come in Dr. Decoswan
ftb addict :P
i gotta get my fix, man
(in a dream) "Man I think I need to fix my pipes or something, the server keeps crashing"
my pipes dont crash the server
that's why it's a dream
do you think i'm just some scrub?
more like a nightmare
not even in my dreams!
lol
But I may actually dream about ftb... >_>
We have 380k rf/t! think of the possibilities!
haha
I used to work out my contraptions on paper before bed to avoid that happening
vgh
humble coop bundle has Damned for 5.80
so anyways, andrew
haha that's dedication ment
i'm gonna move a bunch of my stuff from the old base to the new one, so your cake machine may encounter some problems
okey
just fix them
lol
I won't be on today probably
the bone and wheat supply will get cut off
YOU'RE CUTTING ME OFF!?!?!
lol
lol only did that in the old days with my coal to diamond machine :P
YOU'RE OUT OF MY WILL!
but yeah, gonna move all the crafting recipies
and items
okey
hoi
hai
I'll put up the server
right now
ffs
my internet is crap
bypassing my router didnt seem to fix it :(
holy crap my internet may be trash but it's fast right now
66 mbps down
Server is all over the place
i wouldn't know, I can't even stay connected
>_<
it felt like playing a slideshow
changed the memory
lets try this
m31 seems to be better
yeah whatever is wrong with me is a different issue
okaayyyy this is annoying
time to find Charter's number I guess
wooo
lol this automated voice sounded so sad when i asked for a human
lol
"I'd like to speak to a human please" "Oh... Well then, I guess I'll get one for you... WHY CAN'T YOU LOVE MEEEEE?!?!"
there's a female announcer to do interviews with the winners in these matches for a hs tournament, and she seriously makes me cringe with how bad she is both as a reporter and with any basic game knowledge
they should have hired someone better
welp, technician will be here tomorrow
>_<
does it say anything in the server console that may explain why I keep end of streaming, deco?
Been experiencing a bit of lag, nsure if related to the same issue
Socket closed
is your error
can you tp me far away from there when i log back in?
crashed again
I have no clue what is causing this
my console is complaining about a ton of Reika stuff
I would not be surprised

99% chance its not that
yeah I know
So, what was the server doing? I was too busy losing connection to notice
I think it was busy or overloaded :3
I find it interesting how people just kinda freaked out about the order 1886 is so short
It still looks really cool
boreddd
this chick is so bad
so much cringe
I would be bored if I didnt have an essay to write
but I don't want to write it
so i'm croprastinating
what is the topic?
dr faustus
"dr faustus was pretty cool, but not as cool as <teacher's name>."
100/100
lol
but do I put my discussion teacher's name or the main teacher?
decisions decisions
hmm neither, if there are two you need a new approach
I could try writing the essay
"dr faustus was pretty cool. he killed aliens and didnt afraid of anything"
but he didnt technically kill aliens
and by the end of the book he was afraid of going to hell
"dr faustus was a wuss"
he had magical powers from making a deal with the devil though, so he had some balls at the beginning
"dr faustus had balls"
"and then lost them in the end"
100/100
seems good enough to me
just use big font and a lot of spaces inbetween the words to make it fit the length requirement
there are specific formatting requirements though :(
it's only 1.5-2 pages
pretty easy
I just don't want to write it
lol
courtney likes writing papers, maybe she'll write it for you
OOH
I LIKE THIS IDEA
COURTNEYYYYYYBILLE
bunny ears
i need my ftb fix :(
ftb is stale
needs more 1.7
psh it isnt stale
mmhmmm
just gotta be creative
mmmmehhhhhh
Hey guys, I have a good story!
There were a lot of things we couldn't do in an SR-71, but we were the fastest guys on the block and loved reminding our fellow aviators of this fact. People often asked us if, because of this fact, it was fun to fly the jet. Fun would not be the first word I would use to describe flying this plane. Intense, maybe. Even cerebral. But there was one day in our Sled experience when we would have to say that it was pure fun to be the fastest guys out there, at least for a moment.
It occurred when Walt and I were flying our final training sortie. We needed 100 hours in the jet to complete our training and attain Mission Ready status. Somewhere over Colorado we had passed the century mark. We had made the turn in Arizona and the jet was performing flawlessly. My gauges were wired in the front seat and we were starting to feel pretty good about ourselves, not only because we would soon be flying real missions but because we had gained a great deal of confidence in the plane in the past ten months. Ripping across the barren deserts 80,000 feet below us, I could already see the coast of California from the Arizona border. I was, finally, after many humbling months of simulators and study, ahead of the jet.
I was beginning to feel a bit sorry for Walter in the back seat. There he was, with no really good view of the incredible sights before us, tasked with monitoring four different radios. This was good practice for him for when we began flying real missions, when a priority transmission from headquarters could be vital. It had been difficult, too, for me to relinquish control of the radios, as during my entire flying career I had controlled my own transmissions. But it was part of the division of duties in this plane and I had adjusted to it. I still insisted on talking on the radio while we were on the ground, however. Walt was so good at many things, but he couldn't match my expertise at sounding smooth on the radios, a skill that had been honed sharply with years in fighter squadrons where the slightest radio miscue was grounds for beheading. He understood that and allowed me that luxury.
Just to get a sense of what Walt had to contend with, I pulled the radio toggle switches and monitored the frequencies along with him. The predominant radio chatter was from Los Angeles Center, far below us, controlling daily traffic in their sector. While they had us on their scope (albeit briefly), we were in uncontrolled airspace and normally would not talk to them unless we needed to descend into their airspace.
We listened as the shaky voice of a lone Cessna pilot asked Center for a readout of his ground speed. Center replied: "November Charlie 175, I'm showing you at ninety knots on the ground."
Now the thing to understand about Center controllers, was that whether they were talking to a rookie pilot in a Cessna, or to Air Force One, they always spoke in the exact same, calm, deep, professional, tone that made one feel important. I referred to it as the " Houston Center voice." I have always felt that after years of seeing documentaries on this country's space program and listening to the calm and distinct voice of the Houston controllers, that all other controllers since then wanted to sound like that, and that they basically did. And it didn't matter what sector of the country we would be flying in, it always seemed like the same guy was talking. Over the years that tone of voice had become somewhat of a comforting sound to pilots everywhere. Conversely, over the years, pilots always wanted to ensure that, when transmitting, they sounded like Chuck Yeager, or at least like John Wayne. Better to die than sound bad on the radios.
Just moments after the Cessna's inquiry, a Twin Beech piped up on frequency, in a rather superior tone, asking for his ground speed. "I have you at one hundred and twenty-five knots of ground speed." Boy, I thought, the Beechcraft really must think he is dazzling his Cessna brethren. Then out of the blue, a navy F-18 pilot out of NAS Lemoore came up on frequency. You knew right away it was a Navy jock because he sounded very cool on the radios. "Center, Dusty 52 ground speed check". Before Center could reply, I'm thinking to myself, hey, Dusty 52 has a ground speed indicator in that million-dollar cockpit, so why is he asking Center for a readout? Then I got it, ol' Dusty here is making sure that every bug smasher from Mount Whitney to the Mojave knows what true speed is. He's the fastest dude in the valley today, and he just wants everyone to know how much fun he is having in his new Hornet. And the reply, always with that same, calm, voice, with more distinct alliteration than emotion: "Dusty 52, Center, we have you at 620 on the ground."
I had to remind myself that Walt was in control of the radios. Still, I thought, it must be done - in mere seconds we'll be out of the sector and the opportunity will be lost. That Hornet must die, and die now. I thought about all of our Sim training and how important it was that we developed well as a crew and knew that to jump in on the radios now would destroy the integrity of all that we had worked toward becoming. I was torn.
Somewhere, 13 miles above Arizona, there was a pilot screaming inside his space helmet. Then, I heard it. The click of the mic button from the back seat. That was the very moment that I knew Walter and I had become a crew. Very professionally, and with no emotion, Walter spoke: "Los Angeles Center, Aspen 20, can you give us a ground speed check?" There was no hesitation, and the replay came as if was an everyday request. "Aspen 20, I show you at one thousand eight hundred and forty-two knots, across the ground."
I think it was the forty-two knots that I liked the best, so accurate and proud was Center to deliver that information without hesitation, and you just knew he was smiling. But the precise point at which I knew that Walt and I were going to be really good friends for a long time was when he keyed the mic once again to say, in his most fighter-pilot-like voice: "Ah, Center, much thanks, we're showing closer to nineteen hundred on the money."
For a moment Walter was a god. And we finally heard a little crack in the armor of the Houston Center voice, when L.A.came back with, "Roger that Aspen, Your equipment is probably more accurate than ours. You boys have a good one."
It all had lasted for just moments, but in that short, memorable sprint across the southwest, the Navy had been flamed, all mortal airplanes on freq were forced to bow before the King of Speed, and more importantly, Walter and I had crossed the threshold of being a crew. A fine day's work. We never heard another transmission on that frequency all the way to the coast.
For just one day, it truly was fun being the fastest guys out there.
lol
saw that comment on reddit and surprisingly read the whole thing
actually a cool story
i am bored
I just watched Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit and 3 Days to Kill
oh cool, Thermal Dynamics was released
so we can have ducts in 1.7 now
ooh
cool
new pack
both of those movies were pretty good
jack ryan more so than 3 days
wow the new top tier fluxduct can transfer unlimited rf/t
fluiducts transferring rf? weird
fluxduct
oh
lol
name changed
lol
WAIT
DID YOU SAY
UNLIMITED?!??!?!?!
yes, unlimited :D
OOOOOOOOOO:::::::::
Well
we should make that new mod pack
huh
fluiducts can explode now
boo
if you put a super hot fluid in it
oh
and you dont use a high tier duct
oh wow
there is a fluiduct that transfers rf too
lol
same for itemducts
new itemduct that uses rf to instantly transport items
well we could make that modpack
our magic fluid makers probably wont work any more :(
they changed servos, now there's several tiers
cool changes, I am kinda disappointed they don't have a fluiduct that can handle multiple fluids at once though
yeah that was something they tried adding, it kept crashing the forgecraft server lol
really? it seems like it'd be super easy to do something like that
yeah it had to do with the way they sorted getting the fluids out of the pipe
also the process to make a custom pack that people can easily download through FTB or ATLauncher seems very involved
they said they were still planning on adding it but it wasnt gonna be in the first release
Brandon make your own mod
call it Naocable
lol
it does everything
sounds OP
EU/RF/MJ/MEtransfer/Fluids/Items
blam
one cable, unlimited rf/t and fluid thruput. insta-tp of items. how do you craft it? cobblestone
the hardest part of making a mod nowadays is making it compatible with everyone elses' code
items are standardized through forge
energy can just use thermal expansion's energy api
yeah but power transfer and stuff isnt
oh
power basically is
everyone just uses RF as a base now lol
yeah that's true I guess
but then no devilcraft
devilcraft has its uses
even buildcraft is using RF, it just converts to mj
you should make your mod encompass the things devilcraft does, but with rf
too much work
lol
sometimes you have to make a deal with the devil
but I say we just wait for Infinity to add ducts in 2 weeks
yeah, infinity looks really good already anyways
2 much magic
you don't have to use it
other people will <.<
so?
I h8 u majik
it doesnt have arse magic
which is the one true magic
thaumic magic is just a phoney
is ars even updated for 1.7?
yeah
anything new/cooL?
apparently quite a bit since I last used it
i dont know specifics though
gotcha
magic is more evil than industrialcraft
np
thaumcraft is actually much nicer than it used to be
no thaumcraft is poser magic
right
but it's still better than it used to be
i am the first wizrod and I declare it to be so
lol
true wizrods use their arse
hah
arse
I get it
yes
it's like ass
only more british
I do think having a lean pack would be nice
because huge packs are unstable and take forever to load
"DecoCraft"
wat
lol
decorations?
apparently
seems cool
DecoCraft?
some of the coolest space engineers mods are decorations, makes the interior of your ships much less dull
I could see you using that mod, deco
grandfather clocks, chandeliers, wine, telescopes
oooo telescopes
I highly doubt they're usable
from what I can tell they just make a model and stick it on a solid block
same, but that doesnt matter
but it would be cooler if it was functional
just give yourself slowness 50
that'll do the same thing
will it?
yes
lol
but you'd also have to stick a pumpkin on their head with the texture of a circle
super hard to do >.>
i wonder anyone has made a world sharing utility where multiple people can host the same world save
like a crowd-sourced non-dedicated server
that would be cool
seems kinda impractical since dedicated servers are a bit easier to handle
yeah but dedicated servers require a dedicated server
and those cost money
o_O apparently infinity already updated to add in thermal dynamics
well that was fast
I guess it makes sense, the pack was definitely lacking it
one guy on reddit said it takes a minimum of 2 weeks of testing for new mods to get in.. and then there it is, less than 24 hours from release lol
probably because they have been testing for around that long
I'm guessing they gave out a near final build to test
Well we can switch to infinity....
it was one of the FTB guys though, you would think he would know that
i kinda want to finish our aluminum place though
I agree
if the magic really bugs you we could just disable thaum and blood magic (though blood magic is kinda cool)
yeah but the ftb guys are dumb
lol
or we could kill people who use magic
ooh that sounds more fun
I'll make a gravel gun
tech vs magic
and THEN use magic
lol
Tech v. magic server
lol
that'd actually be kinda fun
it would
hmmm does infinity have engineer's toolbox....
so much of magic is thaum though, and I hate thaum
IT DOESNT
MY LIFE!
lol
IT IS RUINED
WAT
guess you gotta make a custom pack
WE MUST MAKE OUR OWN PACK
it is so much work though
ish
We're not that nooby
and its 1.7
i guess if we dont use a launcher it's easier
and it could be lightweight
what
why no launcher
submitting it to the launcher takes some big application with spreadsheets and stuff
oh
and like a 72 hr waiting period for approval
how big
sounds like something long term
We can just make the pack and put it on dropbox
That works too
yeah distributing it between our peeps is easy enough
Well
let's make a list of mods we want
IC2
Buildcraft
MFR
rotarycraft
Thermal everything
Forestry
lol
applied energistics
Engineer's Toolbox
extra utilities
biomes o plenty
bibliocraft
big reactors
probably all the chicken chunks and core stuff
everything in the tech world 2 pack
basically
OH OH OH and traincraft
and railcraft
can't forget those
i'd like carpenter's blocks and chisel mod too
tinkers
can't forget tinkers
yeah those would be cool, they usually present some issues when placed next to pipes and stuff but we'll see if it works
Archimedes' Ships?
Redstone Arsenal seems cool
archimedes is really buggy in smp
ah
then no
how about that one with tanks and planes then
thal had it disabled in our pack for ftb back in the day because of it
don't remember what that one is called
I forget what it's called as well
ooh computercraft
I too forget what it's called
I'd want planes for travel though
woah
o_O
infinity has RF solar panels
ender tech, ender zoo, enderIO, enderStorage, and Draconic Evolution
What is draconic evolution?
it has an RF solar panel that generates over 30k rf/t
cool weaponns and tools and stuff
also super huge energy storage blocks in draconic evolution
hats
i think
Oh traincraft has blimps
aint nobody want hats
hats are fun :(
TRAINCRAFT
LOOK
I CAN MAKE REAL RAILROAD
FINALLY
natura, netherOres
LOOK AT HOW COOL TRAINCRAFT IS
RIGHT NOW
NEI, NEK
OpenBlocks
also infinity claims to have thermal dynamics, but that is a lie
Project Red
Traincraft
orly
twilight forest is fun
solar expansion looks incredibly OP
trains....
3 rf/t from a single block
sounds like an HV solar array
look at the track curves!
and slopes
!!!!
LOOK
deco is having a traingasm
Pneumaticraft
isnt pneumaticraft buggy or something?
trains
i thought I read some reason why it isnt in major packs
i dunno, it was in crash landing
The trains can be electrified
and automated
ooh, reliquary
TRAINS
10000000 votes for trains
I vote for trains
TRAINNNNSSSSS
I vote for brainssss
did deco force you to say that, courtney?
lol
I am his colony
that's a yes
always obedient
Also trains
I vote for trains.
we also need planes
tanks
and trains
well, we're at quite a list of mods
yes we
are
Did you get Traincraft?
uhh let me check
train.... train... hm nope, i dont see it
oh wait there it is
What were the other possible votes?
Add Traincraft next to traincraft
lol
I need an exploring/mobkilling/uniqueitems mod to keep me un-bored
ok
I am going to make a google doc for us to list mods
okay
why I no can edit
sec, must not be enabled
try now
still can't
refresh maybe
would anyone miss factorization if we left it out?
uh
no
besides the lamps
well, there are alternatives to those
what are OPIS and EVOC?
no idea
Performance profiling and vanilla optimizations
apparently
interesting
do we want modular power suits?
yeah
they're fun
no
too OP
and a good alternative to using thaum for 1-block-up-stepping
lol
but they require devilcraft
actually they apparently dont
lol
o.O
^
wut
why do I not have one
the other recipies were also enabled
I have a shitty tinkers one
i just didnt notice :F
lol
tinker mechsuit <<<<<<<< MPS
i hate how modular power suit = lights spammed everywhere
you can always tell when someone owns a power suit
we could probably change a config to make them less op/annoying
Or just dump them
butbutbut
I vote for dumping them
butbutbut
Since they are OP
nay
I vote nay
I'm fine with dumping them
well fine then
because we'll have other armor options
We'll have tanks and planes too
and trains
well if we have them, then they would be very OP
and redstone arsenal and ender io armor
redstone arsenal just replaces durabilities with rf, doesnt it?
i think they have some other special thing
maybe thats just the tools
idk
lol
ender io has armor that lets you glide
and multi jump
same with tinkers
tinkers cant glide, can it?
but it's kinda underpowered
nah, but multijump is a thing
as well as speed upgrades
and customization
i think ender io has 1 block stepping boots
yeah, you can upgrade step height
Tanks and planes is FLans' mod
which doesn't seem to be updated yet?
Oh there are some
nvm
flans mod has never been super stable
hmm
yeah but it's cool
so much for le tanks and le planes
I don't want tonns of crashes though
yeah
portal gun?
portal guns are fun
too OP
i have enjoyed having to actually travel places
no energy cost
Plus they are buggy
Travelling is good
they're not terribly buggy
and if we restricted them I think it'd be fun
Not terribly, but not great
there's a bug with it that crashes and corrupts servers, actually
what's that?
idk if it is fixed
it's present in tech world 2 apparently
idk what triggers it
It happen last tech map I hosted
I had to MCedit some chunks out of existence
well then I guess they're out unless they're fixed
I was reading about it earlier today while trying to diagnose my end of stream problems
it also causes end of steams
lol
lol
i like portal shoes though
oh well
do we want reactorcraft?
yeah
sure
more options are fun
what about steve's carts?
why not add in the pack and just disable the portal guns
I like the boots and high energy pellet shooters
we could do that
because there's some sort of item id conflict that causes end of streams
may be fixed though
ah
there are no more item Id conflicts
I thought that there wew no more item ids
1.7 fixed that
i know it isnt fixed in our version because i was getting spammed by the id conflict message today >_<
lol yeah, but 1.7 is totally new forge
wait wat
high energy pellets
thats why you want it
lol
you bastard
no I really do like the boots
removing the 1 thing doctors are allowed to die to makes dying more entertaining
jet turbines are claiming quite a few doctors these days
^
so anyways
lol really?
steve's carts?
do we use it?
I havent used it at all yet
i have in the past
yeah, in the past
there are better ways to do everything it does
but most of what it does can be done with mfr
I used it once this map
not worth
but if someone wants it i'm not against it
lets leave it out in favor of other trains
yeah
TRAINCRAFT
CHUGGA CHUGGA
chuggachuggachugga
Ok, I've finished going through the tech world mod list
coo
Fastcraft?
wat does
it is just a bunch of optimizations
Infinity uses it
helps maintain TPS, improve chunk loading times, etc
ah cool
so redstone arsenal
everything in andrew's requests list as well
chromatic craft is another Reika mod
it seems
yep
it looks cool
ewww its magic too
do we want decocraft? lol
Sure
lol
seems harmless
inb4 massive world corruption
Also chromaticcraft is 1.5.2?
it'll turn our whole world into a diamond swastika
oh really?
m31 said it was updated
or going to update
or something
Oh
it did it seems
It just wasn't displaying on its main page
cause reikas website sucks
Ender Tech... anyone know wat is?
nope
Don't we want that ender I/0 stuff?
yeah
we want ender tech
wand of equal exchange only without the magic
also big tanks
that's sweet
see, I knew I wanted it for a reason :P
ender zoo looks fun
crazy mobs and stuff
and I think enderStorage is the nice ender chests mod
Ian
Brandon Worl
Ian
Brandon Worl
hi
hi
so, I may have a dedicated server for us to use
Remember Typhuse from T2, ment?
Hmm, was he known by another name?
don't think so
He wants to join us though, and he can get a dedicated server
I don't recall that name (could be alzheimers)
Did he play before I joined TC?
I don't remember
I think he was in NOS
ah
deco, I have bad news
traincraft doesnt seem to be 1.7.10 ready
my internet is fixed :D
:DDDD
custom pack seems to work
also I added Mekanism to the mod list
this looks cool: http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/wip-mods/144-1-7-10-forge-cogs-of-the-machine-v0-1-4pre1-back
awesome
ze pack is ready
it's on technic
just search for "NaoPack"
no traincraft? ;(
hiiii
yeah :(
can it be added later?
i added some cool new mods though
yeah
whenever it updates
it seems the dev is down to one guy :/
so, feel like testing this pack?
We can
what did you add?
wait its on technic?
yeah
dang it
technic is actually easy to add mods to
lol
I killed that launcher ages ago
haha
it looks really nice now
the launcher
Its probably cause FTB looked so much better
So, how do I host this? What ports do I forward?
want me to host?
I haz the RAM
Well, I may have to tweak the pack, so I figure I'll host it just for testing purposes
Did you see that I may be able to get us a dedicated server?
Yes I did
I could ask Thal for one
lol
lol
yeah
wow their launcher is much nicer
yeah
It used to look so unprofessional
and nooby
I NEED TRAINCRAFT
75.142.240.234
installing the pack
Electrical Age is cool
it's beta
but seems super cool
what is it?
What all is in the pack
realistic electrical system and machines
uses voltags and watts and stuff
oh
we still have IC2 yes?
yeah
I'm on mumble with hippos too, btw
why do I get an "Invalid Session (Try restarting your game)" message when I join my server?
that pack looks like fun, was anyone else lagging?
we're all lagging
lol
we were using nukes
lol gotcha
oh
that's what nooks
I thought you were speaking nonsense
electrical age is cool
idk if it's just slow or if my power setup was stupid though
typhuse
taht's so familiar
I tried traincraft
its fun
too bad it doesn't work :(
for 1.7
lol
yeah
some day, hopefully
hi
you here, android?
for the mod pack server files, if anyone is interested
if only traincraft :(
would be of good day
how did you upload the pack to the launcher?
well, at least we have railcraft i guess
i made an account on technic's website
and made a pack there
then gave it a link to my pack hosted on dropbox
ah
I could make the current server use traincraft
lol
porque necessitas android brandone?
when do you want to watch more arrow/flash?
that is a very good question
lol
lol
I'm pretty sure we're busy all this week, at least til friday
we should figure that out tomorrow, I told shannon the next time we skype will depend on when we have time for flash/arrow
okay, I'll talk to alex and figure it out
okie, lemme know
I added traincraft to my copy of Techworld 2
I am sad it is not updated
its pretty factor is really good
poor ian and his lack of trains
good god
this was one of the discussion responses in my CH class
As a pisces, I make decisions based on instinct and intuition, but also keep in mind my past experiences which have been learning lessons. I think instinct and experience are two major factors in decision making and reasoning.
as a pisces
really
and the worst part is it's a guy
a black guy
so the rest of us arent human?
?
everyone does that
not everyone believes in horoscopes that aren't physically accurate
the guy probably wasn't actually born under pisces
just the making decisions based on past experience part i mean
the stars have shifted like four constellations
oh no
that part is fine
just the "as a pisces" part that bugs me
yeah
lol
because that just makes it seem like everyone who does that as not a pisces is an alien
haha yeah, that part of his statement just has so much cringe
I'm required to reply to someone, but i'm afraid if i make some kind of comment on the "why is the pisces part important" my discussion teacher will see it and make us talk about it in class tomorrow lol
lol
whelp, I went for the kill anyway
Not sure what being a pisces has to do with it since i'm not into that kind of thing, but it seems to me that decision making is pretty much the same for any intellegent being. I feel that everyone relies on both instinct and past experience, since intuition is in most cases a byproduct of your past experiences. Biologically speaking, any kind of decision making other than fight/flight reactions are based on something other than instinct, like intuition or rational thinking.
XD
it was only the logical thing to do
yeah, you could say it was almost instinctive >.>
(not really)
I really hope I don't have to talk about that in class
If I can, I avoid talking at all costs
but i'm guessing I will, since all the other comments were "I agree with your point"
lol im sorry
yeah it's fine, she usually has the other person defend first, so if he brings something up about the friggin astrology of the situation I have a scientific BOOM HEADSHOT to finish it off with
As a Libra I am going to have to disagree with you.
actually I have no clue what any zodiac signs mean
they mean literally zero
nothing
nada
zilch
how the hell could what particular configuration of stars (which was fairly arbitrarily decided) happened to be over a particular (possibly not even your side) region of the earth, have anything to do with your biologically assigned mentality?
maybe mentality isn't biologically assigned, and people are impressionable, and zodiacs are vague, so it becomes a self-fufiling prophecy
ugh
that's a possibility, but that could be said for any random factor designed at birth
i got my homework for 219 back today
100% on HW 1, 88% on HW2
only thing written on homework 2: "-12 for rest"
at the end, after the last problem
wat
I did all the problems
o.O
dangit amaranthe, y u add vegas tour date after I bought tickets for LA
lel
tradeable?
nope
ffffffffffffffuck
ebayable?
LA works
road trips are fun
I like LA
it is beautiful
Some of it is
a lot is
not....
at all
lol
Gotta love the beach cities though
wait when coming to LA?
June 3
that is a nice day in the middle of the week
lol yeah
I'll be there for a few days probably
DOKTORS MEETUP INCOMING
it must be done
lol yeah, we could try to get lunch or something while I'm there
From reddit:
dafuqfish
Wels Catfish
you could make an entire pack of fish sticks with its wiskers
rofl
but -shudders-
The article says its the SECOND largest freshwater fish in its region
Watching RoboCop... I was wondering when Samuel Jackson would call someone a MOTHER FUCKER
and there it is
loololol
so, what's the verdict on FTB? Are we gonna do tech + trains or 1.7.10?
there's this mod: http://www.railsofwar.net/showcase/
which is 1.7.10 ready... but reading his latest news post makes me not want to let that code anywhere near a server
It looks really nice
buttttttt
lets see that post
he's rewriting it because he had no clue what he was doing when he first made it
"I also try to generalise some code, use abstraction, inheritance and other concepts of object-oriented programming"
lol
how do you use Java without doing all of that to begin with
Java is like the epitome of object oriented
He must have been a wizrod
^
Exactly
I was about to say that
lol
Java is ADVERTISED that way
lol
Well we could do tech and trains
but the trains and tracks do look nice
or we could wait
Its a beautiful mod
I'm good either way
#waitandjustdo1.7fornow
We could sit on stuff for a bit, and finish our aluminum base.....
I would like to try out Electrical Age
Do they have a 1.6.4 version?
It has a much more complicated pain in the butt power system for inferior machines!
not sure
it's in beta so probably not
There is an upgraded version of Tech World that's out
don't think its 1.7 though
Its not
I just checked
cogs of the machine and electrical age dont seem to be in any major packs
i'd never even heard of them until i found them
hmmm
probably because: It has a much more complicated pain in the butt power system for inferior machines!
lol
but it's coooool!
it has the coolest teleporter ever
EVER
and realistic electrical simulation
if you dont attach a ground to your batteries, they explode
violently
Want to make a test pack with:
Thermal, Electrical Age, those trains you just linked, buildcraft, IC2, chickenbones and cogs?
and maybe rotarycraft
and the WAILA/etc
rotary+reactorcraft
why not just test it with the pack we've got going so far?
if it's 1.7
I mean like turn of the century science pack
Sure
I just want trains ;(
lol
we can try it but i wouldnt be suprised if that pack is terribly inefficient
otherwise just rotary because 1.7 and reactor makes the stupid fusion reactor easier to make
er
that mod
both are updated, meister
and in the pack
That mod is probably a mess
which one?
I'll test it in single player first
the train one
Oh also Andrew
any word on flash/arrow?
I wonder if it supports vanilla rails like traincraft
"Things not to bother me with:
Updates
Backports
Rolling stock
Traincraft
Railcraft
Real trains mod (especially)"
looks like he doesnt intend to integrate with railcraft
Its not
lol
Its its own system
I want to try it though
gonna set up a forge world
inter-mod integration is good though
yeah
i can easily add it to the existing pack if we want to see how it fares
let me test it
he's got a dev version
gonna try it
also Mekanism looks like a lot of fun
so much mods
Mekanism allows you to 15x your ore
wut
and it has a big robot gorilla that poops out ore
at least thats how Etho describes it
15x ore reliably fast?
CRIKEY
just to make sure, quintuple = 15x right? lol
no
STRAI'A mate
oh
welp
5x
hmm
maybe its just 5x then? lol
decaquintiple
15 did seem a little extreme to me
rotary allows a 1/65536 chance to 16x
haha
still 5x aint bad
indeed
it seems like a pain in the ass to make but once it's made it appears to be reliable
flash/arrow still unsure, getting alex from work at 10 and i'll ask again then, she wasnt sure last night
Do you think I'd be safe to tell Shannon thursday for skype?
THE TRACKS ARE FULL SIZED
LIKE FOR REAL TRAINS
OH MY
ohgod
which mod?
yeah thursday I have a meeting with my group so I probably won't have time
ok
this mod is beautiful
hmm Cogs of the Machine hasn't changed in 2 years
Trains of wat is still creative only
boy its amazingly beautiful though
hands down best looking MC mod
ever
YOU CAN WALK INSIDE THE TRAINS
ohhh
blowdryer
lol
ok lycanite's mobs are too annoying
they keep spawning even if you're on peaceful
and they play the same sound over and over
looooool
they're like villagers only they spawn everywhere
they have been cut from the pack
>_<
well
railcraft is ruined for me now
lol
lol
Their steam engines are lame
this mod
looks soo soooooo sooooooo
good
apparently theres a way to run older mods on 1.7.10
OH?
how?
TRAINCRAFT
also
Openttd in minecraft simulator
apparently it only lets you run 1.2.5 mods on 1.7.10
and it's super buggy
oh
darn
am sad
is no love for trains
get the source and let's update it! (by let's, I mean you guys)
oh so brandon
tomorrow, flash/arrow for a few episodes + homemade pizza?
sure
cool, alex and I get out at like 530 so we can do it at like 630 or something
ok, i have homework to do but I should be able to finish it before then
also can I use your scanner tomorrow?
cool, yeah I have a discussion post to do but that's it
sure
gotta scan my HW #2 to get my 12 points back
also, after that, Friday after alex gets of at 10 would work, and sunday all day before 7pm would work as well. alex works 7pm - 3am for inventory
anyone want to play CAH with Hippos & Co. at 5:30?
got dat hw to do before we do arrow/flash
brandog, you wanna chip in and do pizza from a place or just do home made?
we could do that or i have a party size enchillada tray
wat
lol
i do
it has 16 in it
do they have massive amounts of cheese in them?
probably
probably shouldnt then, alex probably couldnt eat much
well, i'm good either way on the pizza
do you have cash moneys?
yes
okay, deciding now :P
okay so we're thinking we'll make the homemade one, and also get a medium pizza and 12 breadsticks from round table for 25 bucks
ok
works for me
sweet, do you have 8 doll hairs?
i do
aweshum
gonna order it now, and start the homemade now as well
do you have 10 dollars? forgot the tip/delivery fee
sure
cool beans
pretty sure the xbox has a cw app
so we may have an ultra easy way to watch
not that the current way isnt easy
almost ready sirrah?
i can be
still playing CAH
gotcha
alex is almost done her hw
ok
so if you wanted to head out in a few that'd be coo
i'll wrap up CAH and get ready then
cocoo
cocoo
hhahahaha
Dr.
Hallo
hola
howdy
how goes it?
Alright
How about you?
pretty good, played any hearthstone lately?
Haven't loaded it up for more than a month
Anything new there?
I haven't seen any of the new cards
not really anything super new since gvg
hmm
the new cards are a lot of fun though
I remember reading, and seeing a few previews, they look like they'll help players be more creative in the game.
yeah you can do quite a few things now, unfortunately most of ranked play looks the same because there are a few unfixed, overpowered cards left and everyone plays them
Either way I should still be at pro noob level
Just where I left off :p

what's it called when you have a long string and you cut off the end of it and place "..."?
after like 20 characters or something
ellipses
something like that
i know the ... is an ellipses, but there's a term for shortening the string
oh
truncate!
that's it
yes
lol
hi
greetings
greetings
this stupid table is off by 1 pixel
so whats the plan for ftb
lol, so while we had Engineer's Toolbox I would always wind up at www.engineeringtoolbox.com on accident, which has stuff like formulas and such
now that I am using Electrical Age, I am purposely at that website looking up formulas for electricity
I want to try this electric mod
Leonard Nimoy has passed away apparently :(
OH NO :<
indeed
T_T
Didn't expect that at all.
yeah...
sad
Khaaaaaaan!
lol yeah... :<
what the hail
SO much hail outside
there were clouds of thousands of little hail balls flying across the street
and piles of hail along the sidewalks
hail?
yes, little balls of ice falling from the sky
super sad about spock
plus
alex's dad was supposed to have lunch with wayne newton and william shatner, but he has a feeling shatner's gonna cancel since neemoy died
maybe not
dunno how shatner will take it
yeah, dunno
is brandog busy? alex/I are up for some arrow if you are, alex works at 6
sure I can arrow
okey cool, alex has to do some hw real quack but we'll do it in a little bit
by it I mean arrow
ok I'm just watching a tutorial on Electrical Age so lemme know when
lol
okay
those feels* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXDIf9imQ3U
wow
beautiful music
Indeed
i hope my lame little tribute to him did justice
Quite nice
still sucks though...what's the death version of live long and prosper?
hmm, I think vulcans never really die, they transfer their katra (soul) to friend of family. Could be wrong.
it's a nice thought
hi
so, typhuse was laid off apparently so he can't get us a dedicated server for MC now
:F
I could maybe host it from my laptop and just leave that on all the time
as a temporary solution
I'd also be willing to split the cost for a VPS if anyone is interested in doing that
How much does one of those vps' go for?
if we go with vnucleus, the 4gb self-managed one is $48.00 per month, but we can do a student discount for 20% off
or maybe a friends discount? lol idk
lol
I feel bad accepting free stuff from thal though, and I'd like to keep contol of the server to us, rather than having it all community run
Indeed
If we only have like 5 people on at a time, hosting it from home would probably work fine
I'm pretty sure thal would either give us a really good deal or a free low-cost one
well we need at least the 4gb plan
electrical age is cool
i discovered last night that I had my solar panels set up wrong
turns out red is positive and blue is negative
also turns out you need to ground the negative side
lol
when are we gonna arrow?
soon, alex is almost done her hw
okey, ready when you are
k
i'll head over in a sec
guys
I only have 2 days left to buy a winRAR license
ono
better hurry, I heard your refrigerator is running too
!!!
well, I have a MC server running on my laptop
that sounds like fun
IP for after I drop alex off at work?
75.142.240.234
what's it running?
the pack I made
ah
you shut it down?
no
i am switching it to a wired ethernet connection
and it kicked us
lol
ahh lol
k it's wired and restarting
okey
Brandon Worl
Brandon Worl
server crash
i shift right clicked with an ender io axe
gg
For mez: http://imgur.com/Ih3oNco
gg
that damn axe
right clicking is a death sentence
lol
an old friend is gonna join the server
i dont want him to build near us though
so if he asks you and I are doing a project together, andrew
off in some distant land
lol
okay
who is it?
typhuse
oh right
a guy from T2
is there a modlist for the pack?
i cannae find it
mostly up to date
i removed lycanites mobs and battle towers
i think im going to do my own base this time, just for kicks and giggles
we're doing it the hard way
with electrical age
tons of stuff made and only 40 rf/t
lol
o.O
oh lawd
stacks and stacks of iron and copper invested
and so little power
modular systems is a great mod though
we can smelt like 20 stacks in a few seconds with a fraction of 1 coal
o.O
our furnace has 30.8x speed, 10x efficiency, and cooks 1 items at once
the wikis for these mods are so very laughably incomplete
kinda frustrating
yeah
allo?
allo
is the server up?
yeah
need the ip?
please
75.142.240.234
ok, modular thingymabob does not like me
o_O
2 CTD's in that inventory
CTD?
crash to desktop
oh
maybe looking in there while I add/remove storage expansions causes it
possibly
man, AE2 is a lot of work to get started
vgh
vgh
Looks like I won't be joining you guys this time around. The modpack takes ages to load and crashes to desktop after a while. :(
vgs
it's a smaller pack than we've used in the past, wonder why it does that
I'm unsure if technicpack requires 64bit support, this could be the issue I think.
I've got 4gb ram so that should be enough, shouldn't it
It shouldn't require 64 bit, though 64 bit would make it much better
well 3 gb ram free after windows
technic just downloads the mods, it's run via java like any other version of minecraft though
so it will try to do 32 or 64
yeah, i'll have to play around with the setup and read up on the forums.
A custom pack should be less trouble than the huge packs out there shouldn't it :P
found my lag problem
forgot to increase the ram allotment
lol
1g of lag
now at 4g
lol, i had 1gb too apparently
I did as well, fixed it yesterday
that's a big burger
in fact
idk if you can actually call it a burger
more like a monstrosity
what was that burger/pizza thing we saw a while back that looked amazing but Ian found it repulsive?
its like the opposite of that
like that was a burgerpizza, and this is like a pizza stuffed inside a burger
arghhhh food
now I am hungry
downloading bf4 since i've been craving that
that wall is trippy
carpenter's blocks?
yeah
that's sick
made from quarried stone :P
das mah blok
woo
bf4 finished
also, rise of incarnates is actually kinda cool
just played some
seems pretty skill-based
so I made a new larger modular furnace
it is so fast it doesn't have time to realize it needs to consume fuel
it smelts an entire stack in like 2 ticks
lol
add an i/o port
I will
nao, is the server up atm?
nvm, he got it to work
pretty sure the server is always up
unless it crashes
yeah
hi
HI
saw that
I wonder if they  have a license deal as well, the 5% of your revenue to use their program seems like something large companies would try to avoid
hm
you guys see the new cities: skylines thing? looks pretty cool
Hey
Yup looks like a spiritual successor to simcity
well, i'm halfway to salvation and alex and jesus are already dead. Alex got bitten by a zombie, and jesus got shot by a bandit
aaand brandon just got bit
tony got a fever, then got bit, and I ran out of food
normal mode is hard
organ trail?
please tell me that's the actual name for a zombie game
it is
glorious
yeah, was playing for a bit earlier cause I was bored
and procrastinating core humanities essay
wow
modular systems (the furnace/processor mod) has a divide by 0 crash
o.O
interesting
you'd think they would try: catch that
and handle it somehow
you'd think
java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero

it's something to do with the burn time
yeah, probably because you made your furnace too fast
lol
too efficient I think
the fuel icon never indicates that it's using fuel
doesn't affect the furnace though
just the ore processor
and they are comprable to each other
weird
but it looks like he isn't using good object oriented design and thus rewriting code
so that isnt suprising
yeah
this the same dude that was like "i didnt know how to program when i wrote this"?
no
well it sure seems that way lol
lol
well, i sent the error to him on the forums
coo coo kachoo
wow nether ores are good
one ore = 2 normal ore = 4 dust
oh wow
I was wondering if there was a reason to use them rather than overworld ores
i have the digital miner running in the nether
brilliant
from processing 2 stacks of gold ore and 2 stacks of nether gold ore, i went from level 0 to 32 lol
wow
Greatings from the worst State, Utah
mehhh... connecticut is probably worse
Oooooohtah
no no no
Nowhere is as bad as Utah
well
The only thing wrong with this state is the people
lol
#mormonlife4lyfe
lol
brandoge you reddeh to go get dem panquakes?
yeah
okey
we're gonna go soon
i'll let ya know
alex is waiting for some chick from verizon to call her back, her phone is probably semi-brokeded
lol
wut, etho joined hermitcraft too? lol
apparently
alrighty, wanna head over?
sure
one of my leftover mozzerella sticks had no cheese in it, andrew
lol no way
too bad you didnt notice, I woulda made them give me another
lol
so I just broke the mc server for the first time
turns out ME conduit (From Ender IO) doesn't work with our version of AE2
interesting
need to update or something?
nope
there's no version out yet that works with AE2 RV2
gotcha
so, just dont use ME conduit lol
sounds good
i have auto crafting now though :D
opieOP
wat
twitch thing
sorry
lol
lol
auto crafting is far less OP now though
translates to "nice, sounds OP"
like.. it's thing big thing and I only have room for 126 patterns
this bing*
big**
lol
so its more expensive now basically? in both space and resources to recipes
and in design
that's my crafter
woah
that's cool looking
lol
you can build it however
looks like it needs more fractals
this was just the best design I could come up with for the space
each of those ME interfaces can hold 9 patterns
each of the glass things is a crafter
the thing on the far left is for crafting cpus and crafting memory
sounds like your time saved autocrafting is put into making the crafter instead
and each me interface takes an ME channel so you can't just make it huge
...my computer, on startup, now plays the full windows animation :<
poor machine
the trick is to just never turn it off
I never shut mine down
I shut mine down every night
i just put mine to sleep
too many lights for me to do that
i want to save power
sleep mode doesnt really use power
it saves the system state to ram and only keeps that powered
doesnt even run any fans
but skype
?
i can quit skype
that's right
still
uh
what does skype matter?
oh any time i put it to sleep a skype chat will bring it back to life
or whatever alt f12 is
then you arent puting it to sleep
what is that
standby
sleep shuts down everything
processor, gpu, everything except ram
yeah standby and sleep are different
for sleep you gotta go >start menu - shut down triangle thingy - sleep
a lot of the space in my drive is fonts
...if i have fonts elsewhere I assume it's safe to remove fonts from the windows folder in your boot drive...am I incorrect?
uhh
probably not
er
probably incorrect
lol
hm
shit
my fonts are what's sucking up my very finite space
how much of your drive is fonts?
8.7gb / 256gb
it's sizeable
you only have 256 gb?
this is my SSD
I see
i have a 2tb hd
What else is on your SSD? Windows itself only takes like 20-30 gb including its extremely large cache files
oh shit
pictures may be it
and music
that's more likely to be taking all your space than fonts
lol
wait no
uhh
god i hope i set this up right
"users" is 24gigs
windows is 25
users is 29 for me
keep in mind that all cached files, temp files, downloaded files (by default) and some other things will all be in users/
maybe i should delete my 12 gigs of downloads
lol
that could help lol
I have a VM on mine that takes up like 17gb
holy hell
ok 16gigs free
all is well now
all those fonts
omg
my ssd is only 128 gb :(
I have a 256 gb ssd I could swap it out with
i think that's mine
maybe
but I am too lazy to reinstall everything
lol "111gb"
mmmmhm
god my group members have terrible grammar
"There was evidence of the need to run the program every time, but if there was the save of the run it would run faster."
that's like a 4th grade writing level
"Having a better direction as to when assignments are due soon, or when new ones are created."
wat
"In a test case there are multiple levels that need to be navigated, not just instruction on how to label but instruction on how to get something up and running."
wat
uh
1)It was indicated that the program had to be run every time, but it would run faster if saved?
2)I'd like to know when assignments are due and/or created
3)I need a step-by-step rundown on how to make things work
are these critiques?
this was my day today
they are "answers" to an "interview"
we provided both the questions and answers
uh
so there was no real interviewing
no
lol
they are legit critiques other people have mentioned though
however
that grammar is so bad
ah
he puts "the" in every sentence
at least twice
and has no word variety
I can understand him at least. The other guy just straight up made no sense
lol
they both sound like they're straight from ellis island or something
lol
or was that angel island
I think they're both similar
but really though
is english their first language, or did they speak klingon first?
I would show you more examples but I already rewrote all their stuff
lol
haha
you know, engr communication must be hell for these two
Candice grades gramma pretty hard
yeah she does
although, grammar was one of the only things I didnt lose points on for the proposal lol
lol
what are you doing for your project in that class?
we're laying down the basics of sound and light acting as waves, starting with a presentation and a light-through-prism thing, as well as a tuning fork thing, then the kids are going to build cup-string communication devices
sounds fun
yeehhhhh kinda
lol
ian: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWVdk9uH0HI&t=300
everyone else who plays league too
but ian should get a real kick out of it
so, MFR rednet cable connects to everything EXCEPT for ME toggle busses
which is the one thing I need to to connect to
lol
:F
can't you manually toggle it to do it?
doesnt seem to let me
o.O
i have automated crafting for all 3 pure crystals, fluix crystals, charged certus quartz, and all 3 inscriber things :D
nice :D
could probably be more compact
but i like it :D
also I totally just used the programmable rednet controller because it looks cool
looks pretty sweet
lol my windows animation doesn't load before startup
i win agian
want to see the programming competition questions my group member and I wrote? They're pretty funny
yes
he typed it, not me
so any bad grammar is on him
josephus lol
Dr. Harris is our advisor, for anyone who doesnt know
wtf is however doing on two lines with ho and wever being separate
the prime ribs
I don't even know how you do that
lemon for his aid
will be back
lots of stuff seems to be doing that
(read on)
(all of i tis doing that)(
oh i know
will read after food
he's terrible at writing/typing
lol
but how the fuck do you do that
word literally won't let you
he was using mac notepad
o.O
you'd think their text wrapping would be better than that
yeah no
lol
text wrapping? who needs that
"and calculate which student in the circle who won't be failed"
which who
yeah I wasn't kidding when I said they were bad at grammar
i'm just gonna refer you folks to Ed Gant from my piracy class, these guys would love each other
lol
first one is pretty easy
what class are these aimed at?
Dr. Harris' lab
which is mostly grad students
gotcha
archimedes ships might be fun to try out in our pack
the number pyramid one seems hard
<<< watching etho play with them gave me some rather fun ideas if we had it
yeah i'm watching his series now, i think if anything it'd be fun just for transportation in a non-cheaty manner
we can try it
I'm gonna update the pack some time this weekend
I'm also gonna tweak some configs to increase difficulty for a few things
did you see how nova's server was having issues with modular systems?
yeah
we gonna have the same issues eventually you think?
they had problems because hippos broke a modular chest controller before breaking the expansion blocks first
so if we dont do that, we wont
we had to do the pyramid one for the extra question in the intermediate section of last year's contest
oh gotcha
really? the pyramid one seems difficult
yeah I don't think anyone got it
it requires dynamic programming doesnt it?
yeah looks like it, its definitely different then
but we had a number pyramid of some kind and nobody got it
lol
I know one of the questions last competition required dynamic programming
does the moon look neon in reno?
dunno
but its cold outside
so my cousin doesn't read things
apparently
you know how moon picures usually turn out?
like
a white pixel?
i can't tell if she thinks the artist's rendering is awesome
or if she thinks it's an actual pic
they think it's legit
my god
those questions are amazing
lol
lemon for his aid
test
oh no internet
I am back from the human cespool known as Utah
woo
It was rough there for a week
They had ice
and snow
and mormons
The trifecta of EVIL
you should try out the new mod pack, deco
New?
Already?
the custom one
The one you put out about a week and a half ago?
yeah
Any changes to it?
there's been a few updates
idk what state it was in when you last tried it
Build 5 I think?
or so
lol
well, i just updated some mods and added AppleCore/Chocolate Quest
What does that do?
applecore shows how much food a particular item will restore when eaten
and shows saturation
Oh neat
chocolate quest used to be better dungeons mod
I see no train themed stuff has been updated :(
TRAIN DEVS Y U NO LUV
hmmm
my technic launcher wants to take ALL day
I think I've got AE2 figured out :D
nao, would you consider adding in iguana tweaks?
it adds levels to your Tinker's construct tools, allowing you to potentially get way more powerful weapons and tools
Maybe, but it is really OP by default so if I add it, I'll probably nerf some of the config options
sup docs
hi
hi
hi
whatcha been up to?
studying for 219, watching star trek into darkness, and playing mc
two of the three sound fun
yeah
lol
you should see the base progress
I should
we should go get some froyo
that sounds good
indeed it does
but i have 12 minutes left on star trek
well finish it then
lol
alex is doing hw still, but if you wanna go with I'll let you know when she's ready
dont they close soon?
the one over by walmart/chilis/DQ closes at like 11 or 12
ah, ok
well, I am ready whenever
okey
reddeh?
yeag
yeah
coo coo
you wanna drive?
sure
okey, oh btw the one by winco is open til 11 so we're good to go there
cool
yessiree, should we head over?
yeah
omw
welp... my frame bore is built. now I need to test it to make sure it actually moves and functions
I have a feeling it won't >_<
would you like me to troubleshoot it?
we'll see, i had a few last things to put on it
like the annihilation planes
lol
kinda important to have those
indeed
also, the iwrench
use it
love it
what does it do?
it shows you where the problem is if the frame doesn't move
god that was a heart attack moment
i pushed the button and it ripped itself in half
it was just a visual glitch
rofl
lol
time to think about how I want to layout my base :)
I'm pretty happy with my base. Ender IO conduits are amazing
so very much
items, power, fluids, and redstone all run through those airducts
I love enderio
the alloy smelter is great
enderium ingots without a magma crucible :D
god this server takes forever to boot up
aha, the ender rail has a memory leak when teleporting players
that's why it is disabled by default
ah
indeed, that makes sense
also when the hell did it become 3 am
lol
it turns out modular furnaces/ore processors cause block/chunk/whatever updates every time they process an ore
automating them when you have a backlog of like 20k ore = lag
any idea why the bore head on my tunnel bore keeps blowing up, meister?
I'm going to make me a Tom Collins
meister, you here?
I KNOW WHY YOUR BORE HEAD EXPLOSED
okay not really
but it's the thought that counts
maybe it gets too hot?
good god, I understand why everyone hates comic sans now
my ch teacher did the whole study guide in it, and I immediately ctrl+A - font to calibri'd it
lol
I have fianlly used a programmable rednet controller for something it is actually suited towards doing!
it controls the logic behind my hidden crafting station :D
it even needed a logic expansion card
is that fluid making technique of ours dead?
yeah
boo
doesnt matter though. frame bore = more metal than i could ever need
you should come see my base :D
hmmm okay
connection time out
my internet is potato today
yeah the tp seemed to make us all time out
lol
Scrolls through gamelist, finds nothing to play.
vgh
skyrim + mods
infinite replayability
anything + mods
lol yehhhh kinda
btw if you ever wanted to play skyrim with mods, I could get you set up in a jiffy
some of the more complex overhauls are a pain to set up
already played skyrim once, dont need to play it again
oh believe me, you didnt really play skyrim
my current playthough is "hero of whiterun" where i'm prioritizing the whiterun side quests after gaining the experience of being a member of the theives and assassin's guild
I run around finding people who need killing or thieving, jump through some windows and yell "YOU HAVE FAILED THIS CITY" and then shoot them with my bow
lol
really though it's quite fun
just picking a story and going with the flow, making decisions based on that character
like I said, infinite replayability
i am too busy with mc to play skyrim!
lol
i need moar resources
100k iron isnt enough
I'm too busy with school to play skyrim, but that's not stopping me!
i am too busy with studying and making a presentation to play mc right now
so i have it automated to play without me
lol
i swear to god this bird is the most annoying thing on the planet
mockingbird outside your window again?
my neighbor has a caged bird on their patio
ah
that makes the same sound every few seconds for eternity
it's like chinese water torture for your ears
teach it curse words
the manager tonight is an asshat - he insisted on leaving early even though my ride wasn't there yet and I had to wait outside the store alone for 20 minutes. It was so coooooold :(
-_-
I think he forgot that this is Canada
the thought was probably met with a resounding "eh"
eh for asshole
ehsshole
sounds like a russian accent
vodka for yer ehsshole comrade?
I guess so.
u wot
hey andrewww
Hey all
hi
Just hung out with doe and a few others on BC. The craziness we used to get into
Everything alright?
lol
yes
Well aright , it's time to recharge the batteries, been a long day.
ok, have fun sleeping
nao, traincraft is still in the pack, yes?
traincraft isnt updated to 1.7
ah, k
much to deco's despair
tunnle bore OP. I have 6m cobble and 275k iron ingots now
lol
I tweaked the bore and now it doesn't get stuck on natural cobble generators
I can make cobble faster than you I bet
once I get my cobble works up and running
I can make cobble with extra utils too
I'm kinda tempted to make a bedrockium block using non-generated cobble though
just for the visual of how huge a tunnel it takes to make one of those
go for it
6 million out of 43 million, and it has taken around 20km
yes brandonnnnn?
would you be able to drive me to the airportttttttt tomorrow?
what time?
my flight departs at 6:25
hmmm, that's a hairy time, but we probably could make it work
alex works at six
and gets out of class at 345
so if I drop you off first at like 530 or so, that'd be pretty nice
515 if you're feeling sketchy about less than an hour
5:15-5:30 would work
coo coo, sounds like a plan
thanks :D
yessiree
so we had the second project in game engines due today
I started it last night at like 4
stayed up til midnight working on it
i saw my group members working on it
something about boats turning
and finished it at 11 this morning
we had to get oriented physics and tab-entity selection working
as well as modeling and texturing stuff
the issue is that the program was getting a bit big for the current structure since we're still using their sample framework from the tutorials
so it was hell to debug and stuff
next project is actually going to be easier because it's actually structured in a nice OO manner
but yeah, it was pretty fun
did your turning work correctly?
I just wish I could work on it at home, I would have been able to finish earlier. yeah it worked perfectly
i even finished a little of the extra credit
ah, my group members had derpy turning lol
yeah a lot of people did
you could install ogre on a vm
I tried, remember? :F
did you do the optimization flags?
also I tried to figure out modifying the things and it still didnt work
oh, that fixes it for most people
so yeah, but it still failed
it failed to download a bunch of assets, so idk what could have caused that
you could probably get it to work if you messed with it a bit
yeah i'm sure I could
I just don't have time this week lol
midterms and essays and projects out the wazoo
i had all my midterms this week
all 1 of them
4-5 page essay due tomorrow, as well as a midterm in the same class
all of my midterms were on the same day
it was hell
wow
so hard
although really though, 219 is hell no matter what
219 is yuck
indeed
i have no clue how I did on that test
i did it and felt like I was doing badly, then I looked it all over again at the end and it seemed pretty good to me
so, I have no clue
lol
lol yeah that class is a lot of "idk, whatever it looks fine"
all I know is I got the IEEE floating point stuff and Booth's Algorithm correct
because I studied that stuff
IEEE floating point is the fucking devil
nahman
itseasy
I couldnt understand it for the life of me
sign exponent (+127) and mantissa
uh huh
because the exponent is biased
but in binary
yes
and once you do that it takes me like 12 minutes to figure out that part alone
lol
nah
take the whole part, convert to binary
take the fraction, convert to binary
offset decimal
add 127 to exponent
convert to binary
dun
so do it for 123.421
ok 1 sec
2 minutes and counting...
i only started like 1 minute ago
lol
had to get my calculator
lol
this is a really long binary number
lol
lol
the fractional part is super long
it probably can't be held in a normal integer
taht was a big deal in 219
yeah, you have to round the number to 1.09976196625E2
which is why this fractional part never ends for me
lol
we dont get problems like that though
we get like... -1.5
lol
FINALLY DONE GRADING! Now I just need to tally up and record scores
yo if I "send a vid message" dont' click on it
wat
fell for a phishing scam
but like
caught it too late
like
just as i popped in my credentials my brain was like "bro stop"
changed password
still
fuck
:F
gg no re
this 4-5 page paper on piracy will just not write itself
y it so stubborn
pirate one
lol
extra credit!
when asked about it say you were making a point
get 1000% for that
that moment when you take a big drink of your apple juice, and see some unidentifiable object floating it in mid-sip
meh, just a cinnamon piece, lgtm ship it
dnlgtm spit it
(it's really a large culture of a flesh eating bacteria)
what the heck kind of middle name is "deforest"
huh, apparently the guy who played Bones on Star Trek was named Deforest
TIL
...
full name?
of whom?
Imma Deforest Disjungle was his full name I believe
lol
yeah, I can vouch that that is correct
as it should be
as it should be
so say we all.
so say we all.
SO SAY WE ALL.
SO SAY WE ALL!
!
I SAY GOODNIGHT
I SAY GOOD DAY!
I SAY FUCK THIS ESSAY!
...isayyouguysareinsane...
WHATCHU SAY, ESSAY?
nonono, it's ESE, hombre
NO MANG I AM LITERATE
alright now you're just copying your teammates
if i was copying them it would be more like
i am copying the speaking of the teammates for the sentence that i am tpngy
It's just not Pirates,Pirates from the old world history, of the Caribbean to the modern-day hackers and highwayman.,Pirates booty hunters, looking out for treasures, put the fear in people to intimidate, so when you see a pirate you know there's going to be a battle.
solid logic
makes total sense right?
idk why people are bashing this ed gant guy
haha
put the fear in people to intimidate
wow
10/10
I was very tempted to use a quote from one of his discussions in my essay
lol
I think that might be bad though
just reference him all the time like he is god
just a thought
lol
make a direct quote of his in every discussion
"As Mr. Gant pointed out, pirates put the fear in people to intimidate"
HEY GUYS, UNLIKE SMUGGLERS AND HIGHWAYMAN SMUGGLERS WERE QUIET NOT TOO MUCH KILLLING
THEY TAKE BACK THE PORTS AND SELL
then you realize he's mentally retarded and actually doing really well given his situation and feel like crap
oh that's almost definitely what it is, still hilarious
lol
i just image him sitting on the floor with a derpy pirate hat saying "I LIKE PIRATES"
more like "PIRATES THE NICE, I THINK LIKE THEY ARE GOOD PEOPLE WITH BAD BACKGROUND"
PIRATES THE NICE
idk why but that line made me laugh quite a bit
wait did he actually say that? lol
oh no, it just seems so accurate
ah
lol
it does
not bad, I got an 87% on the 219 midterm :D
taht was some fast grading
egbert would have had it done in a few weeks
lol
yo
yp
yp
I have a terribad headache
so yeah
not so bad
browch
I have some insane writers block
and by that I mean i'm floundering around in this essay and it doesnt seem to make a clear point
PIRATES THE NICE
so it's bad
:F
I think the fact that i'm running on five hours of sleep and I had 12 hours of programming plus two midterms and an essay in the last two days might have an effect on the coherency of my thought
hey man, i had 5 hours of sleep and then had to do ALL of my midterms!
oh
so
but how many hours of sleep did you have before and after your five hours of sleep
today we did the programming thing
none
i actually couldnt sleep
lol
lol
so
programming thing
contesto
i thought we ran uploaded code as a restricted user
gotcha
turns out we dont
soooo
right
that sounds bad
one guy uploaded code that cat'd our config file
got the database password
mmhmmmm
then uploaded code that deleted the entire database
lol
yep
GGNORE
lol
that's pretty hilarious
lol
I knew it was possible
did he know it would work?
I knew it would, we had that on our list of stuff to fix before he even did it
lol
so basically he haxxed you
i'm guessing he won the competition?
the current submit site is actually really unsecure too though
and no
because the database was gone
so
but anyways
the current submit site that 302 used is really insecure
same kinda deal?
similar
they do run as a different user but you can exploit that to get root permission
and once you have root you can do whatever you want
lol
how do you make it more secure? just more locks on permissions and stuff?
You can't make it completely secure
I talk to Thal about it, he said with heavy virtualization you can make it secure-ish
but there are exploits that come out all the time in the linux kernal and with virtualization
and we dont have the resources to virtualize every run anyways
yeah that'd be pretty resource intensive lol
you'd have to spin up a new VM, install all the stuff it needs, run the program, then delete the VM
for every run
yummy
so, there really is no way to make it totally secure
lol
so then how do you make it -more- secure besides just running it as a different user
not much you can do, really
interesting
oh also
our database password was "password"
lol
hahhaa
wow
so even if he couldnt just cat all your files he probably could have guessed it
yeah
ggnore sounds appropriate then
lol
We still got good feedback
we have a huge list of stuff to change/fix
nice
progress
hnggggg
i am so hungry
me three
we could all get food before dropping you off at like innout or something
i'm getting cafe rio when i land
pshh nobody likes cafe pee-o
false.
I had cafe rio for dinner yesterday
it was good
Brandini are you almost ready?
so my boss is kinda adorable
like
she called me off-hand young grasshopper or something
then she asked me what the actual term was
I told her Padawan
lol
and she's like, "Oh, and then a master is an Obi-Wan, right?"
lol
"...nnnnooo"
omg
"Padme! No wait that's the princess."
she asked me
and I told her "Jedi..."
the force is not strong with this one
and she's like "Yes then I'm a Jedi"
like
her midichlorian count is the lowest we've ever seen!
lol
put me in a good mood
for nao
Lol
MEOW
WELL MET
Tony, I just beat you in hearthstone
(the dude's battletag was Tony)
lol oh great
you have catch a fantastic fucking song
and the music video is just....
...
yeah
apparently Brandschutzvorschriften = fire safety regulations
Auseinandersetzungsversteigerung
Is a forced public auction of assets disputed by multiple owners
jeeeze
that is a fun word and I like it
meister, if draco asks the server is down for the night but I'll put it up tomorrow around 10-11 am PST
he said he wouldn't get on again till sunday probably
ill be joining midnight on sunday for sure
ok, I'll leave it up saturday night and sunday for you
hey brandog, how good was AC black flag?
didnt finish it
it's like every other assassin creed game ever made
you do the same thing 10000 times
ah, I heard the pirate part was fun
except sometimes when you are repeating the same action 10000 times, it's on a boat
I've been looking for a good pirate/seafaring thing
(I don't like assassins creed)
lol
me either
but I heard black flag was different
so did I
I was disappoint
and there's a huge ubi deal going on
maybe someone will be playing splinter cell
I didnt like it but maybe you will
lol
lol I trust your judgment
watch dogs is also on sale
20 bucks
I'm stuck on ubuntu for the week
I have watch dogs
it was fun
ewwbuntu
(jkjk)
no gaming is no fun though
I got it for free so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
anywho
I've gotten a ton of stuff done on my senior project
since I can't really game
or do other stuff
lol I was gonna say that'd be fricking useful
Programmed for 6 hours straight earlier today lol
and you weren't trying to meet a deadline
well, I kinda am
I want to do all these changes before my group members get a chance to
for many reasons
the fuck
sid mier's starships
?
new game out
mixed reviews
never heard of it
lol
hmmmm i am hungry i wonder what food is here
brb
lol
beef and broccoli it is
yum
so yeah, that game looks like it could have been cool if they spent like another five years on it
also there's a sale/free weekend on the X series of starship games
x-rebirth was supposed to be good
that beef and broccoli was so not filling
oh also I saw Focus tonight
how was it?
it was good
didn't see much of it coming
cool, alex and I were looking for a movie to see this weekend
I liked it, I recommend it
also apparently Cinderella came out today
Shannon and I decided to see Focus 15 minutes before it started, so we rushed to Red Rock casino and there was a huge line
and little kids dressed like cinderella everywhere
haha
Cinderella was damn good
jus sayin
lol
lol
is Dr. Andrew here?
hi yeah he was sleeping, thanks for checking :P was only half an hour late picking alex up. oops lol
well that was fun
I like that game, havent played it in a while
lol
I made fried chicken for dinner
And didn't share
I make a great breading too
all the taste
none of the grease
How you say?
High temp oil with low smoke content
and cornmeal
blam
Did you make schnitzels?
i liked black flag
hi
hi
greetings
nao u r here?
is it spring break or something
its too cold for spring break
hi
it is
nao
friday do stuff?
I may actually have to text the guy
hi
would thursday be possible?
NO, THURSDAY IS NOT POSSIBLE
huh, apparently nvidia released a new titan gpu, the Titan X and it's actually faster than the 700 series
isnt the 700 series like a year old already?
yeah but they were still faster than the newest titan
my 219 exam got curved
with the curve I have 100%
._.
grats
tanks
son, I am the curve
Says Brandon
lol
the class average after the curve is 70%
idk how people did so bad
it was mostly simple math
Some people (paging Courtney) suck at math
i guess doing math in binary is slightly harder
only if you mess up reading the binary
still though, i never pay attention in that class. I either don't go, or I do go but just read a book the entire time
and I studied for the test the day before i took it
3 e z?
Cities skylines feels a lot like traffic sim 
yeah but its a good looking traffic sim , without the first person view
brandog, you have an unfair advantage in that you've worked with binary before and have taken 301. most people in 219 don't want to be there AND are learning something new lol
plus from what i've heard cpe 201 is a joke now, they learn pretty much nothing
it's not like binary is hard
no, but memory things are difficult to grasp sometimes
though if it was just binary on the exam then your class is lazy and didnt study or go to class
I R BORE
play me in chess with friends bro
looks pretty
im totally buying the soundtrack for it
sooooooooooooooooo gooooooooooooood
interesting
i'll have to listen to it on youtube :P
too good to not buy
o/
o/
o/
now that i have your attention
hello
hi
watsup
nadda
nuthin
was learning a song until i came across a weird ....tab
(porn probably)
jeez tony
so distract
i can confirm, that's how he spends his fridays
lol
hey so
hi so
do you know when you're moving out of your apartment? because alex and I would love to steal it
lol
uhh
wait a minute
just because i'm nekkid fridays
doesn't mean porn
idk the exact date the lease is up, but I'm moving back to vegas the weekend of graduation
also tabs is like the guitar thing
nekkid at your computer
and you think i watch porn?!
gay
lol that could be taken out of such context
so were you planning on continuing to pay your rent until your lease was up? or were you gonna early terminate when you move out?
hehe
i was gonna mention tony's gay porn problem
but he did it for me
well, i think it's an 11 month lease
and you think i watch porn?!
gay
<<< 
but idk
okey
that's up to my parents
if you do snag my apartment I am totally going to hide random crap all over the place
random notes and stuff
well it's probably cheaper to terminate, its a $200 fee as opposed to like 2grand in rent
haha
looking forward to it
I can ask my parents tonight or tomorrow and let you know
sounds good. I think you have to give 30 days notice for when you're moving out, so when you do that if you'd let us know so we can put in for the apartment right when you do that'd be sweet
we did a bunch of apartment hunting this week and found that the view was pretty and nobody elses place was
yep. lol
apparently Abe and Lucas are considering moving to The View
lucas bailed apparently, abe texted me a couple days ago
ah
yeah, he was texting me asking if our apartment was gonna be available and by the time I texted back he said lucas bailed :F
lol
silly lucas
right? this place is so nice
slightly expensive
but you know
whitell point, the place down the street that's an "affordable housing" place (it's literally the same as the view, but cheaper) is like 150/mo cheaper
i am boreddd
indeed
whatcha doin after 2?
(thats when I take alex to work)
going out with shannon tonight at like 6:30, nothing before then
we should play a game
i am on craptop though
I've been playing subnautica
but I've done everything there is to do in the game now
lol
umm.. what else do you have playable on craptop?
random stuff
Left 4 Dead actually sounds kinda fun right now
your mom sounds fun right now
Haven't heard your mom, but l4d2 sounds fun :P
that was alex -_-
I don't think I have l4d2
vgs
We should do some Don't Starve sometime.
dont have that either :F
i have don't starve
sadly I've already given away the beta key I had
guitar
so my mom just walked in my room as I was watching an LP of cities skylines and now she wants it
lol
haha
it does look nice
she found bdub's ineptitude with his sewage system hilarious
does your mom do city planning stuff or something?
no, but she's always loved RCT, zoo tycoon, and other similar games
gotcha
your name is on there
lol they spelled his name wrong
Thomas More was the philosopher to whom they are referring
haha
horror game o hell no nope nope nope
What's the matter Colonel Sanders... Chicken?
cluck cluck
lol
did someone say horror game? :D
Aye t'was Mr. Moore
survival horror, trailer is above
for a horror game that trailer wasn't very horrifying
unreal 4 is fucking pretty though
I hope Frictional Games doesn't make their next game follow in the direction AAMFP
I really hope they make it themselves and don't hire the chinese room or some english majors to "make it a more fancy experience" or whatever
making a horror game would be fun
seems tough to do right though
it would definitely be something you'd have to plan and really KNOW what you're doing so the features come out like you planned
A VR implementation would help make it more succesful I think
definitely
tony, you need marco's guitar: https://scontent-sjc.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xtf1/v/t1.0-9/11075026_98673855403_8479678_n.jpg?oh=130d99334f7280bbc8895f534ee15cf5&oe=55BD355C
both of those are pretty eccentric looking
who
who's marco
what's he from
lol
is it the base and guitar or the mandolin you're pointing me to?
the guy on the right
marco is the male vocals/guitar for nightwish
anywho, bbl
that is a bass guitar
literally a bass and a guitar
for when you want to play bass, guitar, and vocals: the voicebasstar!
seems about right
it fucking works with everything
but continues to listen to it anyway
not half bad actually
Its cause its a 4 chord song
It works with all other 4 chord songs
yeah... a couple parts here and there are a bit painful to listen to though
im still stuck on my listening to the ori and the blind forest soundtrack for the seventh time though :x
Muh current tunes
I love jazz, I just can't listen to it for long periods of time without getting bored :(
i can listen to rock for a little bit, but the one thing i can listen to forever is orchestral
That's my current favourite
that stuff. listen to all day
^__^
That piece I linked is like 5 movements long but its fantastic
"That piece ... is fantastic"
you could just crop it there :)
lol
Some people aren't into Symphonies/Concertos because of their length
the longer the better imo
however as far as ragtime goes, a piece that im going to learn with my sister's boyfriend: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNi2oxH37vo
Oh you like long classical works?
very much
That comes highly recommended then
Delius isn't really well known, but his works are great
And, if you haven't listened to Grofe's Grand Canyon Suite
Then that too
several times
mostly for a music appreciation class, but yeah
The 1920's and 1930's were the scene for American classics
If you didn't guess I'm a fan of the modernist period of classical music
Also Grofe's Metropolis
is a great listen
Its no rhapsody in blue
but still good
the delius piece tho holy crap
Yeah I know right?
I know I just dumped like 5 hours of music on you.
But its all worth a listen
no problem whatsoever
Delius is surprisingly unknown
For some odd reason
I bought a gun
wat kind?
Mauser k98
ooh, old school
That's right
lol
ask him how much money he threw at it
Not that much really
600?
No actually
$270
Thats a steal
wow, that is a steal
tell her that's a steal
See
didnt see any online for less than like 600 (I looked for about 30 seconds)
psh
Its so cheap cause its got a Yugoslavian receiver
but the barrel and bolt are Nazi
sounds dangerous
Actually they had to build new receivers cause the original ones were prone to breaking
The German ones were more dangerous
But the gun being 100% Nazi pushes the value to the $600-$700 market
I was looking for a receiver in the nfl from yugoslavia. couldnt find it :P
I think they made something like 300,000
They are listed as Yugo remanufactured normally
they rarely tell you what was actually remanufactured
interesting
You can get czech ones for around ~$320
Guns are so rare here. I don't get the want for them.
it's basically a big boy toy in the muricas
people say they're getting them for protection, but unless they live in compton they're probably just getting it for fun, with a little side of protection
I get mine 90% for historical value
^ I can understand that
like I said, big boy toy
( ʘ̆ ╭͜ʖ╮ ʘ̆ )
wat
lol
i feel like playing some custom amnesia stories
that does sound like fun
i'm doing my os simulation part 1
it's not fun
that does not sound like fun
yeah
so far just getting the info from the config file is a pain in the ass
White Night looks like a cool Amnesia mod
you guys should get Arma 3
the battle royale game mode looks fun
I like wasteland
the mc server will be up all night/tomorrow meister, incase you plan on hopping on
mwahahahaha
hey brandog, i forgot when you fly in tomorrow, lemme know when you wake up/get this
I arrive at 8:15
pm
okey
Greetings
yo nao, did the ip change again? o.O
also hai
o/
\o
|o
o|
o/
so i listened to the ori soundtrack last night to keep me calm while furiously trying to write a program due today at 330
it was nice
^__^
so good
ori soundtrack?
relevant
love it
lol that image
yeah the soundtrack is really cool
very nice
makes me wanna play the game
Very calming that soundtrack
my laptop's local ip might have changed, meister
which would have broken the port forwarding
I can fix it if you want
otherwise I'll just wait since I'm flying back to Reno tomorrow anyways
might as well wait, not much time left for me to play anyways
@andrew http://www.twitch.tv/mamytwink longest hearthstone turn, world record. The crazy things people do.
At least the music is nice.
Hi guys :p
hi
hehe yeah I saw that on reddit
approx 40 hours or something
I see m31 has joined the Cities: Skylines club
oohhhh
didn't I tell you I enjoyed those "suh-WING and a miss!" moments?
friend posted a horrid propaganda piece about how vaccines are terrible, blah blah, the usual stuff
and everyone's in on the satire
"oh i guess we're addicts" "lol we'll ruin our children"
then some bro comes in
"Just like global warming, ha ha"
does finger guns at Brandon
he gets it
anybody see that new combat mod thing?
modular combat
that's what it's called
it's free
combat mod?
yeah its a HL2 mod
but it's standalone
so you don't need HL2
at least that's what I gathered
it looked fun
hi
hai
mc server should be back up: 75.142.240.234
this guy's code for my os class is fucking beautiful
he wrote it in c++ though
so i'm less impressed
I wrote mine in c
and his looks like mine would if I used c++
but still
he also didnt pay attention to several details that leverington wanted done, like the name of the compiled program and the method of interface (command line arg vs command line/cin interface)
yummm uswirl leftovers for breakfast
lol
"So there is some problem with the Make thing, when a save and change of the buttons the Modal will not pop up until a reload"
wat
is that a feedback thing for the site?
it's my group member explaining a bug on his branch
I think descriptions are usually better when you don't use the word "thing"
Looks like a few packets got lost in transit
"save and change of the buttons" o_O
lol
yeah that part also makes no sense
but we know it has something to do with the make thing
apparently what he meant was when you delete the make file and then try to create a new one, the modal doesn't pop up
idk why he's even doing this
i've said like 5 times I'm going to rewrite our makefile stuff
lol
so i looked at their bug and it's a 2 line fix
just remove 2 lines
i told them eactly where the first line is
and they are still "working on fixing it"
if you know how to fix it why not just do it?
not my branch
i'd make it all my branch :P
that branch is a mess
it's been duplicated twice
lol
hi
ey yo androo you wanna get some of dem taco 2'sdays witme soon?
so remember how i found some unidentifyable object floating in my apple cider a week ago?
wat
I forgot about that and poured myself another glass
it was full of unidentifyable... stuff
and i of course noticed it after I took a drink
TIL eating potatoes can kill you
they're only related to nightshade
TIL breathing potatoes can kill you
^tried to breathe a potato
lol
really though, rotting potatoes emit toxic gas apparently
yeah
I have a new irrational fear
not to mention they grow friggin roots and makes you gag cause it looks freaking disgusting
lol
gag cuz it looks bad while you gag because it's killing you with toxic fumes
indeed
yo i herd you like to gag so I threw some toxic gas on your rooted potato
so you could gag while you gag

yeah mips is superrrr mehh
aint nobody got tim fo full length programs in mips
stupid ic2 broke my mod pack
my poor computer had a BSOD while I was at the store
so there's a bug with AE2/Mekanism V8 that makes it impossible to craft almost any AE2 items
and there's a fix on the AE2 github in an open pull request, but it's just been sitting there for 11 hours
I'm no expert but I'm pretty sure this isn't how it's supposed to work: http://i.imgur.com/0IVJpeT.png?1
lol
so if you have 256 pages at 4kb per page, and 64 frames, how many bits do you need for the:
A: Logical address
B: Physical address
i totally forgot how to do that sort of thing
lol me too, it was on our OS quiz today
and it's probably on your final
so
what
what
wat
wut
btw andrew, i already watched last week's arrow/flash while i was in vegas
so if you haven't yet, feel free to
okey
possibly solution to color blindness, but it involves an injection into your eyeball
that sounds very unpleasant
I heard about that on NPR today
...hm
the pictures on the bottom of the page are hard
i saw 21 on the 2nd and nothing on the 3rd
actually i thought the 3rd was one where you have to follow the line from one end of the circle to the other
I got the first one right away, but the second I got 71 and the third, eventually (by looking at individual "pixels") I got 6
once that proved impossible i looked and saw that it was supposed to be a number...
lol
everyone gets the first one
lol
yeah i'm pretty sure the second is 71
12 74 6
?
the second one is whatever and 21
21 if you're color blind
The 2nd is 74
the 2nd is 21
no way mayne
it says so right under the image
74 and 21
apparently it is 74
^
I see a 1
wut
lol
you must be half color blind!
a mix of 74 and 21
I can see the 21 if I peer closely
You may have poor colour perception
I have super color blindness
Yeah i see the 4 now
it was just me not following the pixels closely enough
although that statistic that color blind people only see 1% of the colors that a normal person sees seems bogus
i can't even imagine that the world would look like with 99% more color
I believe it
nono, people with total color blindness
red-green is a small subset
that's basically non-existant and not at all what the article focused on
and red-green is the vast majority of color blindness
yeah its the majority, but the colors impacted are a small subset of full colorblindness
Brandoni is colour blind?
si
is
Red-Green?
mono-chromatic color blindness is so rare they don't even have good statistics on what percentage of the population is affected by it
yeah
You cant see my favourite colour then :( 
oh well. nothing wrong with some greyscale.
yeah, but I guarantee it's either a typo or they don't mean red-green colorblindness for people only seeing 1%
lol, I can see red and green
just fewer shades
Well, if you take the quote in isolation it is correct, because they say color blindness instead of color deficiency, but they use "color blindless" to describe color deficiency throughout the rest of the article
can you see the one in the very bottom right cube?
so idk
yes
lol
yay you can see my favourite ^-^
That definately looks like its missing 99% of its colour
i wonder what type of color blindness that image is supposed to represent?
red-green
supposedly
well, the two images look very different to me lol
maybe like full blown every red-green deficiency you can have
i've always wondered what being yellow-blue color blind would be like
who needs yellow and blue anyways
only Ian likes blue.
lapis is blue
blue is pretty
yuck
thus lapis is pretty
blue is pretty, lapis is not
incorrect!
god remember how you placed lapis all over my beautiful base back on that first mc map?
how aweful
who needs lapis when you have stone
I didnt place lapis all over the place... I just gave you a block or two every once in a while
no, the backup base thingy a little bit away from there
you made the door all lapis-y
oh yeah, ,that looked good though
>_>
I hate to break it to you...
buuuutttt
no
oh yeah
it did
fosho
lol
I think your red-green colorblindness makes you appreciate lapis less
mmmmnope
lol
lapiz
Honestly
Everyone knows
White
is the masterrace
KKK confirmed
haha
oh also, three k's, half life 3 confirmed
Hitler confirmed
guys
guys
guess what friday is
friddas?
Friday
the 27th
it is when the new nightwish album comes out :D
one score plus seven days into march
is that a ghost love score or just a regular score, though?
probably ghostly love
the new three days grace album comes out tuesday
and the new breaking benjamin album comes out soon as well
yes but nightwishhhh :D
pshhh
apparently the last track is 24 minutes long
lapis is better
....
.....
do I need to remove lapis from the mod pack?
cuz I will
lol I don't even play :P
I'll say it's because of you in the change log
so that people will get mad at you when all the recipes that need it stop working
lol
TIL our hat was a jerk back in 1812
But for
the Canadians in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, the War of 1812
presented a golden opportunity to capitalize on declining American
markets
weird formatting, copied it off of ARES course reserves from my history class
what a way to start a new branch. Deleted 12 files and a few hundred lines of code right off the bat
lol
now to deal with the aftermath of removing such a large chunk of stuff >_<
sounds like fun
aaaaand done
that was less painful than I expected
33 files changed, 149 lines added, 425 removed, and it's now much more functional than before
sounds like a good pull request to me :D
yeah that sounds like some good changes if it's smaller and more functional
i basically deleted everything we had that dealt with make files
and then just made it so you can share any file from the test case with all students
so you can upload a makefile and then just share it
or any other file for that matter
haha so your partner was actually doing the changes for no reason the day before you totally redid the system
yeah
gg
they had a few other things on that branch
which I also convinced them needed to be redone
sooo
lol
their entire branch is going to be undone except for like 5 lines in a db migration
"you guys did something? *to self - "goddamn it"*"
but that's what happens when you just write code without thinking/planning or discussing it first
yeah, sounds like most of the code written by most of the cs students
yeah
lol
did I show you the dude's code for my os grading?
i made my teammates wait like a month before we even started writing code
so that I could go through some examples on my own first to figure out the proper way to do stuff
and so that I could force them to do the same
lol
no
you mentioned it though
you said it was beautiful, but you also said it is c++
can you open tar.gz's?
which is contradictory
yeah
it's beautiful as far as c++ goes
I didnt read it line for line, because it worked out of the box and looked pretty as-is, so there could be little things
but it really is well written, you could tell it was planned out
he also used boost libraries, which I just learned about today
or whatever they're called
supposedly they're like STL on steroids
well, his styling is consistent and decent
some of the things like how he handled input/output were weird
multi-line function calls usually get some sort of indication to indicate that it's a line continuation, but otherwise good looking
also i can't stand having curly braces after function declarations/if statements/etc
what kind of indication would you use?
just indent the subsequent lines one indent
Michael nearly told us that those kind of brackets were required today
like
some-function(arg1, arg2, 
   arg3, arg4,
   arg5)
he argued for them for like 20 minutes in class
He said the same to me
his logic is flawed
it breaks the visual flow
it is bad
he went on about "something something blocks are easier to understand something something studies have been done with research, etc."
I can't stand leverington though
He's far too focused on formulaic approaches to making "good code"
with his 6 step method or whatever
he didnt preach that to us
and his over-the-top documentation
the thing with curly braces is, we don't need to read them, as programmers
he just has said so far that your code should be self-documenting (which contradicts his 135 approach because he uses that documentation for teaching purposes)
thats why a lot of languages no longer have them
and that he wasnts the braces like so
and that single letter variables are a no-no. period.
what is important to read is the "if" or function call
and then the next logical thing to seek is the content of that block
he's taking 25% off of any assignment that uses a single letter variable anywhere in code
and having a brace in the way breaks the visual flow
I agree
which is why python looks so good
no extra space
wat
single letter variables are fine if used reasonably
nono, i agree with your bracket stuff
and that single letter variables are fine in like for(i, blah)
yeah
because you don't need a descriptor
for int i is basically the standard
i clearly means index
lol
it's sufficient to know that it's iterating to whatever the condition is
and what if it's a game and you're iterating over x,y,z coords
yeah. I can't stand leverington lol
and the kicker is, he's teaching 302 next semester
he said x, y, and z were lazy variables that came from theory, and shouldnt be standard in code because they're not descriptive enough
which sounds god-aweful
lol
but I have to pitch Submit to him
leverington is doing datastructures next semester? I heard harris was doing it again
how the hell is x,y,z not descriptive enough
lol
nope
harris said so himself yesterday
interesting
nolan/blackdude didn't correct us when we were talking about that earlier today :P
lol
I was talking with some of the game dev dudes about next semester's classes
unless that was just a nightmare
we got into good vs bad teachers
leverington bad teacher of the year!
of the decade!
lol
welp, I think I will head to bed
hit the hay
count some sheep
saw some logs
lie down for a while and hallucinate
wrap myself up like a taquito
the last one is accurate
I have proof
anyway, i'mma go put the magic red blanket on and catch some z's as well
o_O they're making a sequal to Olympus Has Fallen?
lame
why lame?
I thought it would be a good standalone, but trying to follow up a good, dramatic movie like that just seems like they're trying too hard
well, it's London this time
orly?
yeah
different characters?
London has Fallen
same characters
"London bridge has Fallen down "
lol
i could totally see that being in the previews
y it no keep formatting
that's weird
the formatting was working for me
if you go back to edit a message with formatting, it disappears
andrew
tony
hi
"I found out my annoying coworker from Jersey has facial hair. I guess she forgot to shave or something."
lol
i had the first half muted, didnt realize it was a video :P
oh lol
but yes
the gray stubble dotted her rotund chin like a burned down forest on a pink marshmallow
i am so confused right now
such poetry
we should play a game or something
i'm watching I, Frankenstein
any good?
its 'aight
probably crap compared to young frankenstein
lol
errythang is "ok" compared to young frankenstein
"Great Knockers!" -doctor (speaking about a door)
"Oh, thank you doctor" -chick
"What hump?"
lol
look what a friend made for me
awesome XD
lol
that is like no joke my expression
and theirs
i would like to know where all the humans are during all these events in I, Frankenstein
surely they must have noticed the giant fire ball that descended down a hole straight to hell
for real though
yo yo yo err'body
yah
how ya doin
generikb here
owait
lol
take care! brush your hair!
guys
tomorrow
new nightwish album
i feel like playing a game
energetic are we?
are we?
Do you haz Arma 3?
If not its currently 50% off
i do not currently
Its better than arma 2
And I have fun with it
and I hate most shooters
i am debating whether or not i want to buy it
You want to buy it
I will play it with you
do you like wasteland?
not sure what it is
it sounds familiar
Its kinda like DayZ
but no zombies
only killing humans
Also Domination is fun
and other stuff
but is good fun
I will buy it then
Woo!
it's installing
woot woot
nao
Tony get dat arma3
no nevada tour location?
lame
yeah no nevada D:
but new album :D
Anyone want to see my main interchange on cities skylines?
lol
sure
dafuq
that looks dangerous
Its messy
but it works
And its still better looking than the Birmingham England freeway
lol
It was worse previously
I have 5 freeways meeting there
That's the problem
and they don't line up evenly
sooooo yeah
I see
Next city will have the freeway built earlier
I didn't have a freeway for 20 years
so yeahhhh
My downtown
"Belt Buckle" interchange
looks much better
that looks really clean
That's what happens when I plan ahead
want to play some arma 3morrow deco?
hey brandog how hard was doing collision in python ogre?
and did it have anything to help
uhh
i dont remember
lol
i can look at my code and tell you though
nbd, i'm just thinking about the final project
we're planning on doing mario kart with boats, basically
lol boats
and I wanted to make it pseudo-realistic physics wise
with bouncing on waves or something and ramps, etc
github doesnt seem to want to load
I need to learn github
and git in general
it's confusing at first but really not that hard
if I don't find a good learning source I may pick your brain, as usual :P
no clue if that's the most complete version of the game
i'd assume it is
it looks like i just assume a cubic bounding box for all entities
and i do an n^2 check
lol
lol, so pretty slow stuff
okay
for many entities, yeah
will your game mostly be played on a plane?
yes, kind of
if it's all on the same plane that simplifies it a bit
I'm hoping it's not going to be just colliding with a plane
i have no clue how to handle terrain collision
but if that makes it 1000 times easier, then that's what we'll do
that's why my game is in space
no terrain
lol
yeah
oh I guarantee a plane is infinitely easier
lol
ogre has its own terrain mapping, so I assumed it'd have an interface for using the map for collision
you can probably get terrain coordinates, and use that
well yeah, but if we just do a plane then our project isnt that impressive
it doesn't have any sort of collision stuff built in afaik
and yeah, i'll look into ogre's terrain
I didnt think so
but I wasnt sure if you knew of some hidden library
well, you could try to integrate Bullet or some other physics engine that does support collision detection
is iteritems() a python list thing?
yeah
i think
lol
lol
oh, my group member wrote our collision code apparently
i didnt think he contributed anything
he did that and the sound didnt he?
we didnt have sound
well then
he was supposed to do sound :P
i remember
he did something projectile related
and then I removed it and redid it better
yeah he added the first bullets
yep
lol
lol
he also tried to make the exe's
I'm really a bad group member
I just take everything everyone else does and redo it
well, if it's not done right, it's gotta be redone
by someone at least
until it's right
and if you want it done right, you gotta do it yourself
exactly
or something like that
lol
#lazyboyz
you could maybe use oct-trees for your collision stuff
that would be more impressive from a technical pov
yeah ogre has oct trees built in I think
yeah, it might
I saw something about it, included in the renderer
anywho
time for bed
ok
btw
do you want to watch arrow/flash some time?
yes
probably sat/sun
ok
i'll check with alex and let you know
we still have to catch up first :P
the newest arrow looks like a good one
is he the DEMON!?!?!?
ok
bedtim
night
night
nature preslices oranges for us
Brandon still living?
yes
Erma?
i was about to go to bed
lol
Do you have work or class tomorrow?
i already turned my desktop off, i just happen to be looking at my laptop
no
Darn
but i am tired
I understand
lol
haha
I suppose we can play tomorrow
si
si
buenos noches senor
buenos noches
... actually i should check on my mc server real quick
haha
i'm trying to figure out why my tunnel bore keeps getting big holes in the bore head
creepers?
TNT carts?
no nearby players so none should be spawning
it's in the deep dark so no mineshafts
hmmm
it always happens at little underground water pockets
Its hydrophobic?
i tried extending the range of my chunk loaders incase the pockets are generating after terrain generation and after my bore head moves into the area
welp, chunk loading didnt fix it
Is it a problem with it hitting air?
air shouldnt damage it
it does however seem to have a hard time breaking miner's delight
this giant frame bore gets stuck on them every now and then
it'd be kinda comical if it wasnt so annoying
ok bed 5real now
night
night
downloading new nightwish album :D
streaming or dowloading
what's this one called
Endless Forms most Beautiful
only released in EU right now
so I pirated it
pft
well
i know you'll actually buy the thing lol
so ok
nah, I'll stream it on Google Music
but I bought two concert tickets
lol
OH WAIT NIGHTWISH
as in
not WT
...
who's this flor?
this is floor
roof is on fire
lover her voice
who floor?
what floor
oh
yes floor
floors voice
i thought we were dicking around for a bit yeah floor
the ladie's voice
the that's-not-tarja's voice
well anette was also not tarja
but yeah, floor is an amazing singer
this album is definitely different than their others
so apparently China is DDoSing github
why
they're targeting two repos
they're project that allow people to circumvent china's firewall/banned wbesite stuff
and github totally defeated their ddos with like 1 line of code
lol
they just made those repos inject a line of javascript into the attacking machine;s browser that pops up a javascript alert box
which slowed the ddos enough to where it isnt harming anything
lol
"let's fuck with the CENTER OF PROGRAMMING"

so mekanism v8 basically makes big reactors and the draconic evolution energy storage seem like jokes
o.O
it's harder to fuel, but it can produce millions of rf/t
wut
and store trillions of rf in the new multiblock energy storage thing
WHAT IS THIS MYSTERY FUEL SOURCE
tritium and deuterium
well then
there is literally 0 documentation on it
if you want to learn about the new stuff
it's a very new update lol
that video is super long but it does cover everything
and the guy isn't an absolute ADHD ridden annoyance
like the other mekanism spotlights
so it's an hour of solid info?
._.
he goes over stuff like how to build the multiblock structures and such
noice
you can skip a lot of it
the video description has timestamps
but yeah. lots of cool stuff
also the mc server is having ticking issues
and I have no clue why
anyway, i'm going to go to bed
night
soup
hi
is actually not good in the summer
Want to play Arma?
yes, after I finish redoing my AE2 circuit autocrafter
ok
how goes zee autokrafting
making the patterns for the interfaces
I'm gonna eat and stuff first, so Arma in an hour or two?
sure
i am ready to arma whenever you are
also my new AE2 processor/crystal crafter is sexy
the entire thing uses like 5 me channels
compared to like 20-30 before
before: http://i.imgur.com/gymqdP6.png
after: http://i.imgur.com/e9fYdhO.png
nice
tanks
subnetworks are awesome
indeed :D
completely eliminated the need for dense cable
I just cant wait till I can actually play full time again
lol
one more week :F
I finally fixed my tunnel bore's hole problem
i just had to (significantly) increase the range on my chunk loaders
lol
i guess the water pockets generate slightly after terrain generation
so it was generating the holes inside the bore head
im going to make a tunnel bore that's a bit larger than yours
just a little
lol
I already have like 700k iron and redstone and tons of everything else except copper
from bedrock to 70 or so in the deep dark
I am tempted to make a Mekanism laser powered bore
but ill be using rotarycraft
because silk touch
a mekanism bore could just fly over the top of the deep dark lower layer, and mine straight to bedrock
although
actually that reminds me
there are random bedrock things in the middle air layer
so that could be a problem...
Arma?
sure
I went to the liquer store
can you call?
yeah, 1 sec
Brandon Worl
Ian
smallest quarry ive ever seen
Brandon Worl
Ian
howdy
greetings
I had dinner
What is everyone up to?
adding deep storage units to my AE system
I made a Cuba Libre
How are your units?
they're working
I am bored
such storage room
o.O
dang bro
still waiting on a few DSUs to craft
DSU's take forever to craft
still need 13 more at the time of the screenshot?
yeah
and it's still crafting all 13
._.
I have the materials, it's just bottlenecked by the alloy smelter
ah
making enderium?
I was, just finished it
now it's making quartz glass
lol
it seems my system has a recipe for plastic but is unable to actually craft any
I want guacamole
that sounds good
like really fresh stuff
with lots of cilantro
and lime
yum cilantro
Yum yum
I don't think courtney's on
while historically ive hated guac, im starting to like it more... sounds good right now actually :x
good guac is good
bad guac is meh
it's more the texture that ive not liked
Load it on a chip
so good
also avocado pie
nom nom
meister would you have any use for a bit of pitchblend?
yes
yes I would
eventually
i have 226,000 ore if you want it
I have no use for it
._.
not using big reactors?
nope
well then... more for me I guess :3
lol
also, OK FINE I like guac
I'll be using a mekanism reactor
I have top tier solar flux solar panels though, so power is already a non-issue for me
just convinced my mom to make some and it was rather good.
Brandon do you want to play Arma tonight?
sadly, we have no cilantro
I see... those solar panels expensive?
they are pretty expensive
4096 rf/t per top tier panel
and maybe, deco
wow
they're espensive enough that my crafting cpus couldnt do it with just 1 64k crafting storage cell
hmm
logs, 12k glass, 30 obsidian, 3502 redstone, 348 gold ingots, 954 lapis, 344 tin, among other things
and a crap ton of crafting
dafuuu
dang son
perhaps my cobbleworks will be useful afterall
autocraft sand, glass, gravel, flint, and silicon
as well as bedrockium
storage wall is done :D
5 DSUs left over
i accidentally pumped like 40k apples into one of them though... so I am slowly moving them back out with an import bus
lol
I should really set up better than 2x ore processing...
How about x11 ore processing?
x11? wut
I was thinking more like 5
or maybe 4 if i am lazy
or maybe even 3
3 is easy with rotarycraft and mekanism
because I have so much that it doesn't even matter
4 is a nuisance with mechanism and 5 is a massive headache with both
lol
mechanism is only bad because of brine
^
setting up a bunch of machines and pipes, I can deal with
brine sucks
GUYS
GUYS
hi
hi
SYUG
I have 2 avocados
4 limes
I had one
then I had guac :)
a bunch of cilanto
but no cilantro :(
I have 0 ingredients
and 5 jalepinos
everything I own is a pre-packaged meal
I also have tomatillos
eww... the spicy is great with jalapenos but the taste is freaking awful (pickled ones at least)
I should build a big brine/tritium/deuterium factory
wat
jalapenos taste amazing
Don't they?
pickled jalapennos are god awful
i dont like pickled anything
so I'll agree with that
I have fresh ones
I can deal with those
I also have a habenero
but when they sneak into my sandwiches at subway via pickles is makes me very unhappy
mmmmm habanero
honestly I don't think it's worth making a >3x ore processor
it will take way too much effort to make it keep up with my incoming ore rate
my current processor is just a draconic chest with an import and export bus....
you can't beat that level of simplicity
ill be doing rotarycraft x5
because once I get the speed going, nothing is faster than that
mekanism 5x can have speed upgrades in V8, but producing all that brine just seems annoying
64 items in like 1 second? lol
maybe with full speed buffs on top tier factories
although smelting a stack with a max factory takes like 4-5 seconds i think
yyyyyyyeah gonna go with rotary lol
also it takes so much power. lol
the thing is I can make my berserk fusion reactor much easier now
how much rf/t does it make?
too
700k iron, 500k lead, 351k silver, 305k osmium, 151k tin, 147k gold, 80k ferrous.... I think I'm set on ingots
except for copper
i only have 10k copper
Big Reactors is pretty serious power gen, albiet a bit expensive, and then there's Railcraft Boilers paired with a treefarm. Obviously you can pump the Nether/Mystcraft too.
And then there's Reika's Kamehameha Tokomak Reactor, which produces basically as much power as you can pull from it.
Correction; the Tokamak Fusion Reactor generates thirty-two metric fuckloads of shaft power, which can be turned into several million RF/t.
lol'd
lol
i just wonder how it compares to the MUCH cheaper mekanism reactor
also... this guy is praising the fusion reactor and calls big reactors expensive?
a bit expensive in early game
yes but the fusion reactor is EXTREMELY ESPENSIVE in any stage of the game
lol
but once you have a good amount of iron, it's free and easy rf
but I really want one just for the same of having it
i burnt my lip on my hotpocket :(
Its got hot in its name you know
this draconic chest can't even keep up with my ore income
and yes.. it does
rightly so, I might add
unless it's not
and has ice in the center
well, it was a jalapeno chicken hotpocket
so you could argue that it is still hot even if it is cold
lol
Brandon could I interest you in some Arma?
i'm not sure why, but the server seems to be less laggy now
sure
would you start the call please?
i am starving suddenly
yes
Brandon Worl
Ian
why the hell would you ever use pickled jalapenos in guac
gross
fresh picked jalapenos + tomatillo + cilantro + avacado + a tiny bit of lime + some seasoning (salt, cayenne, garlic) is all you need
Brandon Worl
Ian
what do we use a military simulator for? driving go karts off of ramps of course
In the middle of a combat zone
seems legit
you know, logging out on the airstrip was probably a bad idea
If your login is unsafe it moves you elsewhere
oh, how thoughtful
yes
Brandon
Ian
would youlike to play arma?
i would
Would you place
"the call"
roger that Money Bags
Brandon Worl
Ian
Brandon do you have a vacuum?
nein
....
okkkkkkkk
o/
bloody hell these halo 5 trailers
Brandon Worl
Ian
lol
wyatt came shortly after you got off and killed adam
i ran off a cliff into the ocean
and then someone started sniping at me
so i hid behind a rock
arma?
no, real life
oh, well please don't die.
i'll try
that would be unfortunate.
Im thinking about getting Arma, but Im worried that when I finally get the hang of it Ian will be bored with it
it's pretty fun
We're talking about Arma III
which is currently 50% off
but
its a combat game
hey brandog
yo
do you remember anything about mouse input from OIS/ogre?
not off the top of my head
why?
I was trying to use your old code as a reference, but couldnt figure out how you were getting your mouse registration
we need to get a left click, and log the position so we can trace a ray to the terrain and select entities based on that ray's intersections
I saw that you were inheriting from OIS.mouseListener, and figured that had something to do with it, but you never explicitly called any of the mouse functions so i was confuse
well, it's all in inputMgr.py
I didn't do anything with mouse coordinates i think
you did in controlMgr.py
but you use the mousePressed function to create bullets or something like that (or I couldnt find where you did that, one of the two) and didnt explicitly call that function so I was trying to figure out how that worked
couldnt find any good OIS documentation either
call what function?
mousePressed, declared in InputMgr
it's probably overriding an OIS function
figured as much, but I couldnt get that function to ever run, which was my problemo :F
well, it's definitely not in any other files
anyway, so if I figured out how to get that click event registered, I knew how to get the mouse's position on screen
so it has to be doing something like that
do you know how to get the ray/position in the world from there?
OIS.MouseListener.__init__(self) is probably relevant
uhh
yeah I had all that
that's one of the boat assignments isnt it?
I remember sushil giving us the code for ray stuff
I may have had it semi-working at one point, so i'll revisit tomorrow morning if I have time
I dont think he gave us any code for ray stuff
well
i'll definitely check though
lol
you definitely want to use a library of some sort for it
the math for ray intersection in 3d is difficult
lol
i did it once a long time ago and it didn't even run in real time
yeah, ogre has a raySceneQuery that does what we want, but they used it in conjunction with CEGUI, which we aren't using
I don't think I used rays at all in my game
I definitely used ray/terrain intersection for one of the assignments though
to do boat selection via mouse
they used CEGUI to get mouse position and the screen size and stuff, which I needed to get other ways or with OIS
yeah
that's part of the requirement
it was extra credit last assignment
Brandon
Moar Arma?
I finished what I had to
to be ready for tomorrow
lol
nah, I'm gonna go to bed around 12-12:30
kk
i dont want my sleep schedule to get too messed up lol
cube is nuts
wtf cubehamster
I want one
my new tunnel bore was working perfectly and now suddenly two of my formation planes arent getting channels
o.O
any idea why?
oh
i know why
i just have no clue why it worked up until now
hi guys
hi
Hi
hi
how goes it?
it goes well
played some arma earlier
i spawned in and there was a big ifrit (i think) trying to run me over
so i dodged it a few times and shot out its tires
all of the tires
then i headshot the driver through the windshield
i felt like a badass
awww yeah
hey brandog
hi
hi
you hungry?
hi
maybe a little, i just ate 5 mozerella sticks
aha
I was gonna ask if you wanted to get in on some round table + flash/arrow
sure
although I just remembered we havent caught up on flash/arrow
so we could find something else to watch lol
well, do you guys have time to watch all 4 episodes?
or we could watch 2 arrow tonight and the 2 flash some other time
we have time to watch all of them, but if we need the time that is a possibility for sure
you don't mind watching them again?
no, but i'd like to shower first (i have mummy blanket hair still)
gotcha, yeah thats fine. I was gonna order the pizza now since we're starvong
ok, i can get ready and be over in like 30 minutes
okey, sounds good. you okay with pitching in 12 bucks for the pizza?
how goes arma
arma goes well. someone tried to run me over repeatedly
so I shot out his tires and his face
lol
If you ask a Spanish Pirate if he knows what real love is, his answer will be, "Si."
also a guy came up to me saying he was new and asking me not to shoot and saying we could be friends
but he was on the other team
so i shot him
and he lay there begging me to revive him
so i ran him over, got out, and shot him in the head twice
then i stole his money and drove off
Sounds good
actually
so arma is like dayz without the threat of zombies?
ruthless is the most fun way to play any game
M31:
lol
with teams, yeah
The game mode Brandon and I play is
and easier access to gear
There are other gamemodes as well
like
dozens
THERE ARE DOZENS OF US
Dozens
ok andrew imma head over thatokaywitchoo?
andrew: why yes brandon, that would be swell
ok, omw
Hi Brandrew
brandrew says hello
ok
Hallo
Tony you could buy arma
that would be cool
hm
"Hey Andrew"
"Hey Ian"
"Hey Brandon"
"If that thing poos, we'd have an island to live on." -Frankie
subnautica seems really cool
it's fun
it only took me about a day to do everything you can currently do in the game
yeah it seemed like it needed more content
the development branch gets new stuff a lot
intermustang
i'm a genius
I set up a solar evaporation tower last night to get lithium while I sleep, then I took the server down all night
lol
got up and turned the server back on to see how much lithium I had....
#firstworldproblems
reika is so obnoxious with his out of date mods
big text overlay in the top left of the screen
yeah but they're such good mod ideas, even if they are old/annoying
you should update them
i never use his mods :F
i will, because it is annoying
lol
but then everyone will have to update
well, they can do so with the push of 1 button
so that is fine
shh buttons are hard to push okay
soon I will have a reactor making millions of rf/t :D
I bet that lithium you made overnight is really helping you with that
of course
watching a hearthstone tournament, this guy just successfully got  a 1/16 rng roll right after getting a 2/15 AND a 1/15, and if he didnt get exactly those three rolls he would have been dead
#hearthstonenoskillallrng
that's a very lucky sequence of events
a 0.055% chance
yeah twitch chat went insane
twitch chat is always insane
lol
I still dont understand how assassins creed is still a thing
after like 10000 fuckups youd think people would realize they kinda suck
everyone seems to love them
but they're so bad
it's really confusing to me
the first one was cool
and they come out with them faster than fucking call of duty
because it had new things that other games didnt have
yeah, but when the other 9 are the exact same.. :F
since then, the franchise has hardly evolved beyond reskinning
lol
the alternate history storylines are cool
but that's about it at this point
I mean, AC Unity had ads and preorders going like the week the french revolution one came out
or do I have the name wrong and unity IS the french one
idk
they're all the same
OH, yeah, the new one is AC Rogue
this chivalry ad makes me want to play chivalry
Hearthstone seems to have a few bugs, first time i've played since last year. I keep losing (bug)
lol
vgh
the new patch/expansion comes out tomorrow here in the US, I think it comes out the second for you fellas outside Freedomland
XD
Hadn't heard anything about it.
the new cards look amazing
The new steampunk cards are crazy
goblins and gnomes I think it was
yeah they're pretty cool as well
Dr. Boom is OP
Yeah I've had a run in with him
he's basically the new ragnaros, if you have the dust for a legendary and you don't have him yet, that's the one you craft 100% :F
I don't have enough :p
so I just finished working my first day as a projectionist
yeah I just spent like 100 bucks when gvg came out and got most of the cards lol
"$30 is too much!"
the 100 bucks was gift cards from christmas
lol
congrats m31ster
$100 on hearthstone
wut
o_O
see above :F I mentioned I wanted some gift cards and practically everyone gave me one :P
I've still got a fair amount of ingame gold
save it for the new expansion, pretty much any of the new wings is gonna be insanely good
awesome
Unrelated, unsure if I linked this already http://www.festo.com/cms/en_corp/9617.htm
I'm really a casual player
lol so am I this month :P only hit rank 8 and i'm not gonna have time to ladder much next month either
Only rank 8 he says..
Still it's pretty good
yeah, i'm just salty cause every month up til now I've increased my rank, finished rank 5 (or 4, i forget)
ah yeah
meister, would you/draco mind if we switch to nova's server since it's being hosted on GH hardware now?
I could ask if we could get our player data transfered over, so we could take an inventory full of supplies
I wouldn't
ill ask him
my server is having crazy ping problems
no clue why
i'll probably just bring over a 64k drive or two full of materials and blocks to make a new ME system
sup folks
hi
Just got home from that work thing
my parents did theirs/my taxes today
I get $750 returned :D
it's like christmas, except i'm just getting money back that I worked for anyways
today is a sad day
my 64gb flashdrive died
D:
awww
...
new 64G flash is probably less than 750 though
actually I just fixed it
lol
i lost all my data though
also they brought back the hyper x flashdrive series
i dont know what sizes they have, but the one I saw was 1 TB
and cost $1200
damn son
nao, when are we planning to move the server over?
nova's server is already running on thal's hardware, so we can do it whenever
k
draco says he'll be ready to move over on Saturday/sunday
HELL BE READY
ok
HELL WILL MOVE OVER, IT IS THE WILL OF DRACO
lol
the server won't be up 24/7, but I can put it up whenever you guys want to hop on to get stuff
np
I'm just gonna continue that world as single player and do MP on the GH server
apparently PoE is derped and all of the cast when damage taken and cast when stunned gems have been renamed to cats when stunned , etc XD
GGG did this on purpose
omg
it summons cats
LOOOOOOOOL
lol
cats when damage taken is a thing
lol
better example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQGbx_1AiVA
I miss PoE
is act 4 out yet?
very soon
teasers
cats on crit OP
coming out at the end of the 1 month race
oh cool
I might pick it back up for that
at least to play through once
"once"
casual
>.>
I only finished through to merciless once so far anyway
i already did my due on diablo 2
i played that campaign like 1000 times
lol
I wanna play diablo as well
the story seemed cool
and I am a very story oriented person
it was
good god the cats at 2 minutes
fucking everywhere
that dude just left a unique bastard sword on the ground
oh he's playing a map
nvm
yup
he'll grab it later
lol
I was confuzzled for a second
besides, iirc the unique bastard sword is crap
well he also left some wool gloves :F
those are also crap
(IK they're crap as well)
lol
yup it sucks
that lvl 14 (vomit)
cannot be frozen is nice though
but not worth it other that that
yeah i have them on at least one of my chars
oh thats the sword
the gloves are something to do with shock iirc
aha, sadima's touch
iiq
item quantity, lightning and fire dmg, and es
iiq is so good
mine had lightning + 11, which is fairly high
yeah that's a fairly high iiq for a low level as well
aurseize are better though
i think my hardcore witch has them
aurseize lvl?
fourty something if i remember right
ah, 36
those are rarity though
yeah
I thought rarity was easier to get on maps
all res though
yeah thats pretty nice
15% is not small
true
kinda a sidegrade
yeah
reduced movespeed :(
that's what boots are for though
yeah, mine were always like +20%
and they have movespeed on the passive tree now kreygasm
so twitch chat kreygasm
lol
lol
best reaction gif
lol
he blink arrowed on top of a pile of dead monsters when he popped a vaal detonate dead strongbox
because he only read the +7 items on the box
lol
gg, GGG
the vid
I liked the challenge from PoE
similar to dark souls difficulty
if you fuck up, you die
pretty simple
i want to play dark souls so bad
its #1 bestgame
for dark souls 1, just pirate it
not a bad idea
nobody does pvp/coop that isnt hacking
so theres no point in getting the real thing
DS2 is getting a DX11 upgrade with better graphics and stuff for like 40 bucks or something including all the dlc
comes out the 7th
i saw that
or the 2nd
or the 1st
depends on who you ask
lol
the new boss is insane
also apparently ds2 is the hardest of the souls/bloodbourne series
according to most of the streamers/pro pvpers
watching zisteau play bloodbourne and hes only died like 3 or 4 times
yeah, they're gonna patch the number of blood vials they give you
at the moment unless you're speedrunning you get way too many
its not that he heals a lot, but he just doesn't get hit in the first place
attacks are too telegraphed
well zisteau is good
believe it or not
lol
true
he's been a souls player for quite a while, and he played a ton of ds2
also, invasions are an opt-in kind of thing in BB
which makes it less fun/scary
he's  doing the most difficult CTM map ever made in minecraft atm and has 2 deaths and hes halfway done with intersection 2
hyper methodical
yeah, once you learn to think like a souls player, hard games become less hard
brandon and I were playing borderlands 2 last night, and he ran into a huge group and died like 4 times, so I had to come save him. the entire time I kept thinking "he'd be bad at dark souls"
lol
lol
psh
lol
if you do that in a souls game you end up creating a new character
well, we ended up doing that on borderlands as well
well that's cause we were dumb and didnt sign in
lol
in your defense, you were using a shotgun for most of it
and I was sniping like a baws
it's all about melee Zer0
that was me
lol
that guy's a number
haha
he is indeed
All my badass points went into shield cap and melee damage
wait wtf
you people have bl2
and haven't been including me
what
we played it for the first time last night
on 360
aww
i have pc
it's fun
it's like
yeah alex got it for me for valentines day
"references, the video game"
lol
it did have lots of jokes
I liked it
do you have the pre-sequel?
nah
I actually heard that was a bit of a letdown
it seemed different at least, slower because of the weird gravity things
I figured it'd still be good since it's newer, etc
Did something similar
lol
i love it
welp
i went through my nether portal
there was a massive explosion
nearly died
and my portal is out
and i have no flint/steel
this should be fun
nvm flamethrowers work
sounds like you need a flamethrower
dammit
i have one
lol
haha
it even had fuel!
still that explosion was odd
HOT DAYUM!
that kinda startled me
haha god, I swear that guy is in everything!
lame, apparently the whole "hearthstone expansion comes out april 1 in X country" was an april fools thing
they said it like two weeks ago :F
it actually comes out the 2nd here as well
I bought a tank and an armoured vehicle today in arma
since the enemy had an armoured division as well
We won because I used a UAV to find their location
lol
that's pretty sweet
super excited to channel my midichloreans and get some fus ro dah going with my hands
haha,
i dont have enough power to use all 20 of my laser prechargers, but my reactor is almost ready :D
soon I will generate a steady 600k rf/t though
LAZURZ
i have to store up 2 billion RF to ignite my reactor
it's taking a while
you're feeding energy off of a caged soul?
nah
You can borrow Courtney's soul for that if you need it, but you'll have to wash it before returning it
it lives :D
600k rf/t
totally sustainable
it only cost like 95385909585 materials
i dont actually have a way to store that much power though
draconic cells
are weak
really?
I thought they held a shitton
mekanism induction cases can store more
they hold 2.something trillion
weak
lol
mekanism can store many trillions
basically mekanism OP
Brandon we should play some arma today
mekanism expensive as hell
well yeah
it seems it has a nice resource cost curve
i used like 12k copper making my solar evaporation towers alone
lol
i dont even know how much i spent on the rest of this
lots of mods seem to be like "our endgame items are our midgame items in parallel!"
several thousand diamonds, iron, steel, etc
and you need good infrastructure to even ignite one of these reactors, which is a cool balance point
yeah that is cool
it looks like a limp penis
pouring out blood
hahhahaha
yes it does
kinda
with a swolen ball sack
lol
making a block that can hold 204 billion rf right now :D
writing OS simulator code right now :(
but doing it in c++ this time :D
he's letting you use c++?
Use c=#?
yeah, using c is extra credit
man, it was mandatory for us
Use D++++
he even took a vote on who wanted to use c or c++
c sharp was a contested option, but the class decided against it and voted for the c++ with c EC option
I was the ONLY person who voted for C++
lol why the hell
idk
everyone voted for c++ in the end in our class
a few (including me) wanted the challenge of using c#
but nobody else liked that idea
c# is easy once you learn the syntax
it's similar to java
yeah, they were just scared of it being a new language
if you know how to make classes, functions, and variables then you're basically set... and learning 3 things isnt hard lol
man this takes forever to craft
after i make this energy storage thing we could do some arma, deco
cool
so brandon, I have to do that white paper thing where I find an issue in computer science and propose a solution to it in a 1 page essay
any ideas?
I was thinking about doing something on ai in the future and the possibility of a skynet-type incident
that sounds like a good idea
I have some quotes (that I originally saw on reddit) from Elon musk and peeps like that, very differing opinions on the matter
yeah, elon is pretty anti-ai
or at least cautious about it
AI IS EVIL
WAKE UP SHEEPLE
makes sense to a point, it's definitely something we should be careful with
I just don't see it being an unstoppable issue like some people do in these articles
So long as you can cut the power supply you're fine
so what you're saying is we need to block out the sun?
what if...
what if the AI start to harvest human body heat for energy?
and put us all in a simulated world
so we dont even know?
We better just EMP everything
i know kung fu.
We'll have you punch them right in the processor
finally done crafting that energy storage block! now I need to craft the energy output block!
lol
the sad thing is, it is total overkill but I just can't allow myself to make the basic version
the lowest level one outputs 25k rf/t, and my wires only handle up to 20k rf/t
yet I feel the need to make the one that outputs 13.1 million rf/t
you need more or faster wires
but i'm using conduits
so i can do it aoo in 1 line
not fast enough
all*
aooOOOOOOOOooooo
wolf
i could add a new power line with cryotheum cooled flux ducts
and get unlimited rf/t transferance
that's the one
do it
i havent done any thermal expansion though
i made 3 machines just to test something
and thats it
war thunder has star wars AT-AT style thingies
Yup
only today though
yeah
for april fools
they are fun though
They also have a world of tanks style event
oh really?
where your tanks don't follow physics
and have health bars
also they shoot potatoes or carrots
lol
lol
gaijin should make a mech game
that thing is sick
the new mc snapshot is pretty awesome too
that's a beefy walker
such armor
They are easy to kill with a tank
we should have developed mechs in WWII instead of tanks
seriously tho
They just have a KV-2 turret
yeah but they have so many guns
and they just look awesome
also looks are all that matters
form isnt just before function, there is no more function
yup
their walking animation is a little awkward looking
yeah, I have a feeling it was done fairly quickly
its only as a joke
so
the animation doesnt seem super in-depth
jokes dont matter
just because its a joke doesnt mean it can't be high quality
still has to be up to the quality of the rest of the game :P
god this takes 5ever and a half to craft
really though, if they made a standalone game out of WT tanks that is entirely walkers, i'd play the crap out of it
..........
i turned on the output for my new power storage and heard an explosion
I have no clue what just blew up
creeper plants?
shouldnt be
i disabled creeper plants and stopped enderminys from attacking creepers
vgrd
well, i dont see any damage
so yayyy, 600k rf/t
and until I craft a larger battery, 204 billion rf of storage
well, that took forever
arma, deco?
parma, john?
I will after dinner if thats alright
sure
you're coming to innout when I get alex, right brandoni?
si
okey
INNOUT
what the hell, my partner put up a pull request with 13 commits and only 56 lines of code
he made a commit for every little thing he did
interesting
he also changed a bunch of styling
i am afraid to look and see what he did
lol
ahhh yisss 1 million iron ingots
100000000000000000000000 ingots
also back from dinner
shall we?
please dial sir
Brandon Worl
Ian
Brandon Worl
Ian
hey brandone, you just about ready to head out?
i yam
alex'll probably be done within the next 20-30 minutes
coo coo, i'll let ya know when she's done
ay yo, she dun breh
wann head ova dis wey?
ay mang lesgo
coo coo
youz guyz get your in'n'out
yes
did you eat your in'n'out?
si
Do you want to try Arma again
sec
gotta look up a bit of code for andrew
kk
YEAH HE'S MINE FOR A FEW MINUTES WAIT YOUR DAMN TURN DECO
i deleted the repo the other day, lol
Are thou vexed bretheren?
gotta look on my laptop vm
lol okey thx :P
I be supremely vexxed brother.
Perhaps I can help you channel that anger
Into.... something productive
sure, buy me arma :F
lol
No no.
Fourth Reich?
I was wondering if perhaps you would like to join my organization
what is OS's class number?
CS###?
lol, former ss members
see
fourth reich (riech?)
Well we're on five now
I don't think the fourth is gonna work out
lol
I blame Greece for the failure of the Fourth Riech
lol
I want War Thunder: 1946
Nazi walkers
prototype planes
prototype guns
against british early jets
i am just imagining old nazis hunched over with their walkers and little tennis balls on the bottoms
and hordes of crappy american equipment
lol
Actually some of them are still on trial
perhaps we should wait to arma until tomorrow
And like half of their bank accounts are still open
and ok
I get off early tomorrow anyway
woah
you guys did some weird IO stuff
i have a class from 2:30-3:45 but am otherwise free
lol
like what?
i think someone else handled that part
the way you got the config and metadata was weird
function within function that passed the file pointer (which is usually discouraged)
i think mr. west wrote that part
i forgot his first name
kanye?
adam?
North?
i want to say adam but i am pretty sure his name isnt adam
oh
its evan
lol
adam west is the mayor on family guy and a famous actor (he was the OG batman)
i know
thats why I assumed it wasnt adam
lol just making sure
oh dear
int i
int i2
int j
lol
they even have descriptions next to them
coulda just named them something descriptive :F
i dont remember who wrote that
looking at the code i am pretty sure it wasnt me lol
if (stuff) { //skip } else if () { things }
i never understood why people do that
if the block does nothing remove that conditional
I don't see where you guys did waiting or time management in threads like at all lol
i think we may have used an actual timer looking back at this code
yeah, we use gettimeofday and a timeval struct
yeah i saw that
we do it like > start timer > do stuff > end timer > calc time
I mean the do stuff part
cause we have to regulate the time in the do stuff area
you know, i dont see that either
i swear it worked though
our output was perfect
like, "start process - time0", "process finished - (time0 + cycles * quantum"
i see where we did it
we seem to do it two ways depending on the situation
most stuff we get the actual time and just do math
yeah i just found it as well
but for the io stuff we do cycles * quantum etc
yeah, but no waiting
you just print the new time
yeah
which seems weird
no need to wait really, since it would be in a separate thread
we can just calculate the end time and print it
yeah but if you do:
get time
print time
print time + commandtime
get next time
there's no guarantee that time + commandtime is greater than next time
which seems to be what you're doing
it doesnt need to be, does it?
imagine you go again right after that
we can move on to the next command while the io stuff "runs" in the background
io operations don't block the main program so there's no reason to use an actual delay
so you have:
time = 0
time = getTime {which is say, 500}
time = commandTime {which is say, 600}
time = getTime {which is called only 50ms after the first gettime, so 550}
that's fine, isnt it?
you have 
that's not chronological
it's supposed to print the current time
your output might be different than ours was
look at log.txt
unless you guys were supposed to simulate multiprocessing
we only print delta time
oh really
we simulated threads that ran in the background in parallel
yeah, we print the sequence of commands and how long each command took
that makes more sense then
because we're supposed to assume a single core
with no preemption
yours has preemption basically
well, no
yours is using multiple cores, kind of
io runs on the io device or something
yeah your assignment seems a bit different
interesting
how long do you think a gettimeofday() call takes?
not long
cause if I do it the way i'm thinking, i'll be making lots of those
t0 = gettimeofday()
currentTime = t0
while(currentTime < t0 + cycle*quantum)
   currentTime = gettimeofday()
then print
does your program have a main loop of some sort?
yeah
you could do it similar to how games do it with time being calculated in the main loop and then pass dt to your other things
while( programqueue !empty())
uhummm
mebbeh
lemme think
my stupid reactor shut down again
for some reason my tritium production seems to fluctuate
the problem with that is that requires multiple calls to get the updated dt
which you can't do with a thread
unless you open the thread, and wait for dt to be >= cycle*quantum
then close it
hmm
idk how that'd work
well, the thread is supposed to be independent of the main program
so if the thread knows when it was created and when it should end, it can handle all that itself
i just mentioned the dt idea because that's generally how simulations are done
yeah, with a while loop like i posted above
yeah i gotcha
I like the idea
I just don't know how the update of dt would work
you'd pass current time rather than dt
so it'd be different
it would still end after the correct amount of time though
yeah, but you pass a void* to the thread function and convert to an integer/double/something, so idk how updating that would work
it'd probably be as simple as updating the dt passed to the function inside the while loop, but i'm not sure if that works or not
it's supposed to be shared memory, but you'd have to be careful with allocation/deallocation
which means you'd probably want a semaphore/mutex lock
which aint nobody got time to do
lol
I see why he changed the output requirements from your assignement
you can just print cycles*quantum
rather than actually keeping track of things
yayyy new hearthstone thingy, and I beat all the new bosses already :D
cheatz!
nah mayne, they only released the first wing
three bosses and two class challenges
ah that makes sense :P
yeah, it was released an hour ago though lol
not here yet :/
yeah, you guys get it tomorrow
lol
sahwwy :F
Im trying out emperor thaurissian
i can wait another day :P
lol
By then the muricans will have all teh tipz and tricks for the europeans :P
Long weekend overhere
haha yeah, people are gonna have some crazy ideas probably
Indeed, I've been trying to play once again
man, two games won and I still havent drawn thaurissian :(
some of these new cards
yeah they're pretty insane
a few of them suck
but you know
kinda expected
changes the dynamic
15 second turn timer? I think not!
I just played him turn 2 with druid :D
thaurissian that is
lol
probably still gonna lose cause its against shaman and he had a hex for it
but still
Playin shaman now, have to get cards out quickly
i'm sad taht lava shock isnt out yet
super excited for that one
It does sound awesome
the guy i'm playing against is using a super overload shaman, i'm guessing he's balancing before it comes out
I try to avoid overloads :S
yeah they're pretty detrimental at the moment
lava shock is gonna hopefully change that
lol this guy is so angry he's waiting the full turn
He had me down to 10 health, then I make a come back and get him down to 1 health. He waits the full turn and leaves the game before I get to land the final blw.
lol
hemadbro
have you had people friend you and say nasty things about your mother yet?
I kept silencing and killing all his deathrattle cards :X
haha not yet, most of them are prett levelheaded
ah, i've had a couple
mostly when I play priest
Wow
I've gotten frustrated a few times but nothing externally noticable. Just pure ineptness on my part :P
Alot of it is just plain luck of the draw
Don't Starve (Frontier Pack includes Don't Starve and DS Together) is on sale at the moment for 5$, Incase you wanted to pic it up.
ohey
cool
thanks
I will probably do that
Hallo folks
hi
Don't you have class?
hey
i decided i didnt want to go :F
I see
and Hello Ment :D
Want to arma then brandon?
Hey Deco :D
in a little bit
kk
well it took me like 40k copper and a ton of other stuff but i think my reactor FINALLY has a stable fuel supply
vgcn
just use industrial craft solar panels
I know how you love them
i have solar flux solar panels
they make a ton of rf/t
but they pale in comparison to this reactor
it makes 600k stable, but I can burn it up to millions of rf/t if i need to
burst*
what will you ever do with that?
point at it and say "look, i can make millions of rf/t"
i might set up some lasers just because
LAZURS
i cant think of anything other than lasers to spend such power on
i had to make 21 solar evaporation towers to fuel this thing
20 for brine and 1 for lithium
>_<
can't you stick an infinite amount of rf/t into an ender quarry and it'll actually perform faster?
dunno
that requires me to move it around though
not if you make it big enough
clear out an entire desert in one go
but if i make it fast enough then it will do the big area quickly
yeah
and then i will need to move it
have turtles do it for you, and hook them up to a web ui like thal did back in teh day
lol
that seems like a lot of work
i have basically unlimited resources already anyways though
Hmm maybe you guys should try one of those quest based modpacks.
The game goes downhill once you've got everything :P
well, there's still a lof of stuff i want to build
none of it uses much power though
i've never made a crazy power source like this before
Ah
i could make a laser frame bore
Would it be more stable than meisters redpower bore?
lol
i have two frame bores that have traveled quite far already
one of them got around 90km before i stopped it to build version 2
o wow
between the two bores i am only half way to making a bedrockium block
Used to make tools and armor?
nah, used to make bedrockium drums
which store like 65k buckets of fluid or something
in a 1x1x1 space
wtf is bedrockium made of?
compressed cobble
40 million cobble
ah lol :O
oh wow
yummy
well at least there's a use for all that cobble now
easy to make with extra utils cobble generators, but i want my first bedrockium to be made entirely of mined cobble
anyways, that enough mc for now. arma, deco?
Time for sleeps, night
night
andrew: can i use your printer/scanner later today?
reactor is moar pretty now :D
whats the black material
Korp from ztones mod
it has like 16 different texture variations
can those lasers not travel thru glass?
nope :(
gotta have a hole
they break blocks is why
logic is strong there
you can use them to mine
i actually leave the lasers off most of the time
their only purpose is to heat up the reactor to start the reaction
after the reactor is started they arent needed
and they use like 30-40k rf/t in total
ahh
sounds expensive
I am familiar with expensive lasers
well, i have 204.8 billion rf stored up
you could power a lot of mining lasers with that
yes
might be a good way to get materials
it can output at like 12m rf/t i think
but i only charge it at 600k rf/t anyways
yeah, i'm gonna set up some lasers soon
600k is enough for 30 lasers at max output
yeah, my base draws like 5k rf/t though
and i need room to expand
if you throttle them down to half speed though you could do 60 and get a wide variety of materials
but still, i may set up like 10 lasers
there are 16 laser focus colors
Yes
i could do 16 i guess
you could do one for each
yeah
that would onl be 320k rf/t
not bad
anyways, want to arma?
sure
care to call?
Brandon Worl
Ian
Courtney Boyle
Brandon Worl
Ian
Courtney Boyle
yeah you can use the scanner/printer
tanks
yerp
just head over when you want to, i'll unlock the door
it'll be after i eat
so in like 1-2 hours
okey, like I said door's unlocked unless jared comes home before then and locks it
I had lucielles
i was unable to rejoin the server
that is most odd
my server list stopped working
perhaps they were updating
or something
or who knows then
what color is the left wall?
off-white/cream
ok, thanks
lol
base design is coming along :D
neato
you and I should build a new super base when the GH server is officially up
lol
we could
It should be made entirely of hexagons
i am so established on my map though
i dont have to worry about resources, and that is nice
i could theoretically load my base in a spacial storage cell and just move it over to the GH server
lol
spacial storage cell?
it's an AE thing
basically save/load structures
oh thats super cool
how do you load them in?
build a structure then put the cell in and push a button
couldn't you cheat stuff in then?
depending on how you build the structure the energy cost to load/save stuff changes
how?
isn't it saved locally?
i doubt it
so you can like put it on other servers?
it's just like a 64k storage drive
oh
so you can only move things on the server
not from server to server
yeah, but if you have console access to both then you could
oh I see
We should build a base
out of hexagons
like a beehive
then
call it
The Beehive
lol
i have discovered that carpenters blocks are awesome
for base design
that's where I got the idea
the grind to make end game ae2/mekanism stuff is just so rough
i don't feel like doing it again
lol
hell the grind to make early game ae2 is hard
There has to be a way to do it faster
using
Devilcraft
(TM)
i havent crafted a single devilcraft item this entire time
well then I will make the deal with Satan then and you can keep your hands clean
i needed mushroom blocks at one point, and in deseration looked to see if devilcraft could help with that
and it couldnt
honestly i dont see any need for IC2 now
I have alternatives for fast furnaces
and that was the only thing I ever missed about IC2
you can get mushroom blocks using MFR
actual blocks?
Sludge to Mycilum then grow the mushroom tree using a planter then cut it down with a harvester to make more sludge
and that makes huge mushroom blocks? not mushroom items?
you plant the mushroom on mycilum and grow it and it makes huge mushrooms
with either bonemeal or fertalizer
yes but the harvester picks up blocks?
I think so
as in item id 99
It did at one point
don't know if it still does
oh well
i dont need them any more anyways
either way that could be used to get the blocks
what did you need that for anyway?
for myst blocks
a white non-connected texture block
ahhh
i went with a different better block in the end
still
hexagon base
i would say we could go a different route than the ender io/mekanism way I went with on the base
and make a super base with different mods
but the alternatives are boring
big reactors is too easy, ic2 is nasty, and TE4 is nice but not terribly exciting for power generation
x_x
I am bored
i am board
thats flat
so I had an idea for a simple but useful mod to write for mc
wats it do
wassat?
add a universal crossover pipe
that way you can have a wire space in your floor or whatever that's only 1 block tall, but lets you cross your item/power/fluid lines
that would be useful
will it support all fluids and energies?
it will just interface with other mod's pipes
wat about EU
so TE ducts, ic2 wires, other pipes that dont already have cross-over functionality
(as in not extra utils pipes or ender io conduits)
well, what're you waiting for?
lol
get on it!
i am too busy playing the game to mod the game :F
firstworldproblems
i may start writing it in a week or two after I finish my senior project
I just have two more bits of functionality to add to it and then it will be done, other than testing and bug fixes
nice
apparently harris is the god of making programs break, so good luck when testing :P
really though, if i had a way to cross TE ducts or mekanism pipes, then I'd probably use them over ender io conduits
ender io seems to make a ton of entities
like, each connection point is a tile entity
as well as each wire
is that not necessary for how they do their rendering?
it might be
but it means that's more things to tick and render
so if I could i would gladly use other pipes, but none are as convenient
TE4 flux/item combo ducts would be a good alternative for some situations though
also these solar evaporation towers are making thousands of orphaned tile entities, which seems bad
that does seem bad
and that, ladies and gentlemen, is why you make backups
my entire mc world deleted itself and regenerated everything
...oh
you know what would suck? A world where people fear birds as much as people fear big spiders or wasps
there are so many birds outside my window
hi folks
hi
now that's what I call a base
needs moar honeycomb
Brandon, want to Arma today?
sure
hidden crafting station :D
when would you like to start?
whenever you want
now?
sure
lemme just backup my world
kk

ribbit
*cricket noises
my base is currently at the top of r/feedthebeast :D
i made stuffed green bell peppers, deco
ooo how are they?
they're in the oven right now
but I had some extra stuffing so I put it on a salad
and its pretty good
my power went out
and it came back
that happens a lot here in reno
After listening to it approximately 35-40 times, I have determined that this new Nightwish album is the best album
... this thing needs me to make a password. the password has to be 6-8 characters long
that's a very narrow window of characters
yes
Also I just did amazing in Arma
Opfor had 3 tanks
No one new how to tank
so I became armoured commander
lol
My unit killed 60 infantry, 3 Amoured personel carriers, 2 Armed APCs, and 1 Main Battle Tank
was Dave there?
no
Which is why we did well
lol
nobody likes dave
We capped like 10 territories too
and I logged off without dying today
Dave is OP
lazorsssss
i still need to hook it up to my storage, but at least they all have power
botton right
of that image
haha
haha
so hows it going brandon?
making 1 of each laser focus for my lazors
ah
I see
that sounds
less than fun
Like getting pink slime
its not fun
man
pink slime was so annoying
Its the worst thing ever
i got 4 pigs and was like "surely that will get a bucket"
lol
it got me 80 mb
40 pigs later
so, i just made an autospawner for pigs
makes sense
We should play arma again tomorrow
indeed
hopefully it will be Dave free
with nether ores, these lasers are getting sooo many different kinds of ore
processing all this is gonna be a pain
yuppppppppp
but it gets glowstone which is nice
They are pretty cool
i'm getting like 2-3 blocks per second from all of them
in total
my base is drawing 327.66 kRF/t
sounds about right
now I have to make this room look cool
>_<
Or
you don't
I must
the rest of my base looks cool
I redid my food farm to look cool, and my new spawner room looks cool
It need moar swastikas
mmmno i dont think so
I know so
man these lasers light you on fire for soooo long
they are very dangerous
my reactor lasers instantly kill me
and destroy my grave
and my items
how kind of them
sounds like you need a lightning gun to get them back for their betrayal!
naahhhh
hey, i'm emailing a dude back about an internship interview meeting time, how does this sound?
Friday at two sounds great, I accepted the schedule time a while ago but figured I'd follow up here as well. Looking forward to meeting you and the rest of the Sciphen staff, thank you again for the opportunity.
with all the salutations and stuff on top and bottom
sounds fine to me
I read it the first time and it sounded weird for some reason
okey
yo foolz
wassup
sniping like a boss
i just got like 13+ kills
wow
mind if I join?
Sure

HELLO, OVER
Greetings, over
HAI
Dave killed us all, over.
dave is a bastard, over
affirmative, over.
how I imagine Tony at ren faire: https://youtu.be/Vhu_mgpYYaM
the first like 10 seconds
lolol
fuck that guy
his name is dave
lol
dem medieval g-strings
reign of kings kinda seems fun
it does
the ending of that video xD
afk
lol yeah, fucking hundred yard drop and he lives
I hear good things aboot reign of kings
hyello
hallo
hillo
heello
hollo
hullo
(this is scott manley)
olleh
oh dear, alex will not like that
wat
he was the first bat that spawned in my base
i named him BATMAN
he must have flown into my laser drill room
lol
I still have Robin the pig
he was the pig that managed to escape and hide from me while I was getting pink slime
... all of my molecular assemblers have typos in their names
now I have to go back and fix all of them
Brandon
nodnarb
seen it
watch it
again
and again
no
and again
You know
we could make a youtube series
of Dave killing us
we could
we'd have plenty of material
but nobody would watch
and it'd require work
Courtney would watch
Did Brandon die?
he went to bed it seems
well darn
even nazi iron man is cool
this seems perfect for me: http://imgur.com/a/QWlSJ
a challenge to build a self-sustaining base in an obsidian box
ezpz
we did it
this one is a bit smaller though
and it needs to generate ores
I have a clever idea though
hey, pretty sure gummy and spider and those other derps had a smaller obs box :P although theirs was just chests of loot
yeah
this one is only 5 wide
wow
theirs was only two high
lol
3 high i believe
they had 2 rows of chests
ah true
i have a plan that is super cheaty
I am going to use frames to live the floor of the box up and then use MFR laser drills to get ores
he said i can't change the obisidan, didnt say anything about moving it temporarily
will that be infinitely sustainable?
if I can generate enough power, yeah
interesting
MFR lasers just generate ore given enough power
they extract resources from bedrock or the void
max speed takes 20k rf/t though
gotcha
folks wanna arma?
sure, in a few minutes
okey
screen cheat seems like an incredibly hard game lol
didnt watch that video series yet
anywho i am ready to arma

i killed like 5 or 6 people on the airfield shortly after you left, andrew
nice
guy called for help so like 3 of us moved in
I feel like my tiredness ruined my ability to handle dying
they flipped their vehicle and were standing around it
lol
so i just sniped them all one after another
I think next time i'm gonna try a different weapon setup
sniping doesnt seem to be my cup of tea
Try a Vermin ACP submachine gun
not sniping tends to end with death
if you arent fond of death i recommend submarines
Vermin + Buildings = Super effective
We could go on the altis map
and control one of the cities
using SMGs
altis seems like too much work
also subs are OP
altis is quite huge
altis is good if you stay near a gun store
otherwise its too big
Still you can hold a city using people in buildings with SMGs
is it the normal game style like we've been playing or is it the altis life mod thing that frankie and peeps were playing
frankie plays a ton of different modes
but altis life isnt the same as wasteland
There are a ton of modes
yeah i thinkn the only one i watched was altis life tho
Altis life is TONS of rules
and regulations
lol
and you need teamspeak
and to sign up for forums
and its easy to get banned
We could do domination
which is humans vs. swathes of AI troops
We could do Compete
if I find a server
well
i can't right now
what is compete?
but later would be good
That's just OPFOR vs. BLUFOR
with no dave?
blufor has no chance without dave
Well there will be a Dave on every server
I could look for a Stratis life server
I've never done that
Still would have a ton of rules though
There is also King of the Hill
which is like domination
but no teams
its like everyone is indies
and you band together with other indies
Theres hostile takeover
which is three teams
fighting for one area
wasteland is fun
doing objectives is kinda fun too
could be fun
There are lots of gamemodes
is my point
I like what we're doing, but when there are a shitton of dudes preventing you from getting a rifle scope it's kinda crappy
there is also Conquer the Island
you just have to take it slow and go to wherever is safest
yeah
which is opfor v. blufor
and your goal is to eleminate the other team
that'd be fun
I'm better at games with a clear objective cause I don't get bored lol
I've never played CTI
it may be good
is it like island vs island or is there only 1 island?
1 island
Altis or Stratis
that sounds like fun
your goal is to control all the territory
isnt that basically the goal of wasteland too? lol
Yes-ish
but I there aren't indies
and you don't have to fight for equipment
I think
i see
and now I want an icee
We should have Andrew try Domination though
its 100% objective based
yeah but its one kind of objective
nope
the objectives on our server are what I like
multiple objectives
domination, not capture the island
most domination has 3-4 missions running at a time
like: get the downed helicopter from the ai, etc?
Like
Kill the AI radio tower to stop there reinforcements
so your troops can take town A
while group B stops enemy infrantry movements
ah, so like battlefield rush mode with more variety
in that you blow something up, i guess.
lol
You do blow up a radio tower
but you also have to capture points
stop convoys
provide air cover
eliminate enemy AA and armour
sounds like fun
my base now makes ONE MILLION RF PER TICK
MUWAHAHAHA
System load
2%
32%
You are using 30RF/t?
i basically made my reactor 2x more efficient
yes
oh
i did so by building a sun dial and automating it with a rednet controller
16 lasers
so, no more night time
means my fuel doesnt have to stop during the night then recover
Arma 3 marksmen seems to have come out today
Out of the closet?
out of the server closet
and onto the production build
Sorry my phunnychlorian count isn't as high as Mez
You can finally deploy bipods in arma
how much is the dlc?
and stabilze your weapon on window sills and such
If you bought the full game originally it should be free
oh cool
Steam says you already have it
so you'll get the new guns
everyone even with the basic pack gets the new physics and stuff for free
we should try this new stuff out
I hope the server is updated for it
there is a new High caliber rifle for OPFOR that looks amazing
can people with the new guys play on hte same server as those without them?
Yes
Everyone gets the physics upgrade
only people with the DLC can use the 7 new guns though
JESUS THIS NEW OPFOR SCOPE
I am testing it in the VR training
This thing makes the SOS look like a potato
link?
I am testing it in game
you want me to take a pic?
also this Cyrus gun looks like it can replace the rahim as our rifle
its got full auto, supression, range, and a bigger faster round
sur
e
i.imgur.com/GEhYQ9V.jpg
bad link
lol
that's pretty nice looking
look at the last one
dang it
they added more animals
I just got freaked out by a sheep
haha
is that the gun we can replace the rahime with in the 1st pic?
Yes
It seems we can
I am testing it
They added a couple new MGs
so we may be able to have a long range MG in our group too
how many rounds does that new gun hold?
i used the mk18 yesterday with its 20 round clips
which was kinda nice
The problem with the Mk18 is its bullet velocity is much worse
Its range maxs out pretty quite
but for closer ranges you need the extra bullets
bipods so good
our server isn't updated yet
darn
but because they aren't on the server list it leads me to believe they are in the process right now
in the mean time I suggest you load up your game and try out the showcases
to learn some new equipment
i will in a sec
and hear the new gun sounds
they are way more realistic
giving tips to avoid lag on the new mc server
lol
herp had a bunch of buildcraft quarries that made the deep dark and overworld tick at 20%
woooooooooooooooooooow
Next time we play we should by a Tigris Anti-Air tank
since they kill everything
so, how do I test out these weapons?
play > Showcases > Marksman
also try the CSAT, NATO, and AAF showcases
now that you can deploy the bipods the Katiba machine guns is amazing
oh and they added a couple Medium machine guns
and a supressed .50 cal
wtf am i supposed to do in this showcase
im just on this island
kill the objective
i dont see any objectives or people
wat
try the VR room them
goto learn, the virtual arsenal
I have no objective but I do see a person now
I feel like my gun should have a bipod or scope or something...
it doesn't? o.O
nope
just a suppressor
welp i got sniped
go to the VR room to test stuff
restarted it, now my gun has stuff and there's a narration
looks like we should use the Navid machine gun
it can be supressed
I rested my gun on a surface and got a blue screen
0/10 would not do again
the hell
wat
basically my reaction
try the VR room
also Navid MMG is super cool
So, yes we should replace our rahims with Cyrus rifles
they do the same job better
how do I deploy my bipod? it said 'C', but that just makes me stand up
The ASP-1 kir seems to be a short range stopping power gun
just set it to left ctrl
It will say it will conflict, but for the purposes your using it for no conflicts will exist
if you use the VR room it also shows all your bullet paths
i ran out of ammo trying to hit the 1km guy
Yeah they seem to have modified the ballistics
if you use a 12.7mm it works though
the lynx
shots can bounce off guns now o.O
jesus it took 2.5 clips but i finally got the 1km guy
this sight doesn't really range very well does it? lol
set it to 900
it seems to over compensate
yeah, 900 works
I'm hitting him virtually every shot
What gun are you using?
cyrus
its pretty good isn't
I think its a suitable replacement for the rahim
It can punch through a plate carrier
is there some way to reset my bullet lines?
leave and come back
haha
or escape
restart
looks like the nightstalker also works better at 900 when shooting 1000
have you tried it full auto?
its got a slow rate of fire
so its controllable
yeah, not bad
i definitely prefer the nightstalker over that other scope
care to call?

Our server is back
hi

it involved 330k items
i had to make a crafting cpu with 5 64k drives specifically for this
nop.jpg
and it's going to take hours
but it will store enough power to run my base for 40 hours
66666

hey brandone
hi
do you happen to have slat?
slat?
yes, slat
salt?
lol
astl
yeah
tlas
same thing
yes
lol
could we steal some?
sure
okey, i'll run over right quack to grab it if thats okay
that is okey
coo coo, omw
I got my stuff back
by going on their empty altis server
and selling helicopters
for 20 minutes
lol
money is so easy to come by though
yup
its not like you are so poor you need to pawn helicopters
I made 35,000 in 20 minutes
I have more than I started with
probably could have just taken out some sunken loot in less than that
nope
or just walk around and grab money off dead people
sunken look costs $ to do
and takes around 30 minutes
to do right
ah
That's $ per person
I should employ this dead server to get moneys and guns, etc
^
it's so easy to get money and guns without doing that though
yehhhh
but I want to do it without dying, just once
I die a lot
I did it just to have it when I log back in tomorrow
So I don't have to risk dying to get reequiped
yeah
that's appealing
Its so I can get right back in the action
the startup/restart times for logging in or dying (since I almost always die before logging) are one of the boring parts of this
yeah
right back in the action is fun
but it's fun sneaking in to a town to get geared up
walking to gerna to get a laser designator, dying, and trying to get anywhere is lame
you spawn with enough money to get a good kit
That does have its merits
We should stop going to Gerna
We ALWAYS die at gerna
yeah, but just once i'd love to start kitted and not die on the way
lol
the only time I got kitted and made semi-good use of it was the first time I played with you guys
Brandon and I once killed a bunch of guys in an old school wild west pistol shootout
and i'm pretty sure that was beginners luck
lol that pistol battle was fun
Too bad the guys we fought sucked
the few awesome battles i've had have been with only a pistol
once in kill farm's gun shop the first time we played (my first kill) and when I was saving brandog A-team style against the dude with a lynx
I have to craft 24,000 enriched alloy >_<
Killing people with a pistol is far more rewarding than mowing them down with God's machine gun
we should be the pistol brigade one day
just pistols and rocket launchers and grenades and stuff
and we should do a game mode where we can take someone hostage and fuck with them
make them run through a town naked, etc
we should get the new .50 cal suppressed guns
shoot them in the foot when they complain
no scopes
that kinda stuff
and just try and ransack towns
that also sounds fun
Or get Vermin ACPs
Those are basically Thompson SMGs
Same bullet too
I had four vermin ACP's over the course of the day
lol
You can unload an entire mag into a guy in .4 seconds on full auto
sounds like fun for a raid weapon
getting sniped would be lame though
if we have our team of five again we could do some really fun takedowns
You have to do it in cities and town
two dudes sniping/UAV spotting, three on the ground taking a town
Though we could all just use my machine gun
with different scopes
Actually it helps to have a rifle
The machine gun is cool, but it sometimes takes 20 rounds to down a guy
im gonna try out the new sniper next time
Yeah, the Cyrus is great
yeah I'm pretty sure the rahim takes a few as well if you don't hit upper body or if they have a good helmet
kinda pricey though
rahim pretty much requires a headshot for a 1-shot kill
I've never gotten a 1-shot 1-kill with one
ah
I have :D
gotcha
Its possible
I believe it
gotten a few at like 800m too :D
Tough for a poor aim like me though
since I'm new
If the guy has basic clothes and no armour the guy goes down in 1 body shot
yeah, like me :P
However the new gun can knock out anyone in 1 shot pretty much
only the most heavily armoured guys can survive 1 if they are lucky
2 will kill any infantry
I think I'll just leave MC on over night to finish crafting these 24k enriched alloy >_<
i estimate it will take 6 hours
yowch
imma go to bed
night
night
$5 says minecraft crashes shortly after I leave my computer
lol
always
So I was cited by Henderson for speeding today -_-
._.
you bad, bad person
no wait
let me make a picture
of what happened
it was such a trap
There
oh, yeah, I hate spots like that
$240
you can probably dispute it and get it dropped
that's bs
Cause Henderson
Well I sent it to my lawyer
so he'll look into it
there's a cop trap over not too far from where I live
they used to have one sign that was out of the way that said no right on red
Worst part was I was on the job getting change from the bank
coming off of a freeway that didn't use to have that sign there
ahhh
now they have 5 signs (I wonder why....)
Its not that I can't pay
I just hate the city of Henderson
lol
they do this stuff all the time
I should just call the mayor and complain
lol you sent a speeding ticket to your lawyer? won't that cost MORE than the ticket?
I mean if he can get you off the hook for even the point against your record that'd be great
but otherwise that seems expensive
there are places that specialize in getting speeding/traffic tickets dropped
Ah you see
He's doing it as a favour
The office I work in takes care of him and his families needs, and he gets paid a sum by the doctor to do all his real estate stuff, so he'll work our tickets for us as a favour
(deco actually put poison in the lawyer's meds, and his life now depends on keeping deco happy)
lol no
sounds like both something deco would do, and one of the few reasons a lawyer would do work for free
(because guys, deco is evil :P)
its true
nahhhh
I have a sudden craving for... chocolate milk
too bad it is disgusting
we've proven this over the years, theres really no denying it
There is no proof
chocolate milk is a lot like dr. pepper
wat
They're both delicious
lol
Dairy is nasty
and if your milk is spoiled, it'll probably make you burp
i had Dr. Pepper for the first time in ages the other day
it was really good
unlike milk
Also did I mention I have 0 prior offenses?
and they slammed me with that $240 ticket
how fast were you going?
90 mph
totally thought you were Ian there
that was my goal
this looks pretty cool
hi o/
\o hi
WOHOO
o.O
that's the dancing dude?
weird
yeah
lol
lol
i want to eat ribs
yummmmm
REEEEED robin
so
i'd rather have Tony Roma's
Imma buy the marksman dlc I think
but not the hoolacoopter one
no need
i has all dlc
yeah but i figure those helicopters are super specific, and the go karts aren't even on the server iirc
there are go karts
we race them around the air strip
plus, it's not like I'll be flying the helicopter
orly
well then i'll buy that
it's two bucks
they arent super necessary lol
yeah but that sounds fun
we should just have a huge race one day where we set up boundarys and stuff in the middle of gerna
that sounds like death
have to do it on christmas or something so we can do the whole "germans and muricans taking the day off for holiday"
more like slaughter the enemy in their sleep on christmas eve
right
but it'd be fun to try
lol
we might be able to pull that off at the air field
only one hillside to get sniped from there
it'd be really cool if we enlisted dave and other high up blufor dudes to help organize it
pretty sure we could get it to happen
no still sounds like death
especially if we have dave there
lol
dave == death
yes
lol, bbl engr 301 meeting
yo nao?
?
what was that esports betting platform a dude in originate was working on?
uhhh
uhhhhhhhhh
Vulcan?
no
uhhhhhhhhhhh
well shit
Versus
hmmmm
googling that was hard
that name is terrible from a searchability viewpoint
I was going 37-38 ish
and slowing down through the intersection
so I think he clocked me in the intersection itself
i got a 29 on that color square thing, tony
i dont understand
wa
i got a 24
lol
yeah how did I get a better score than you? lol
better screen?
maybe
i was considering that
but then
I got a better score than most people I saw in the comments too though
maybe lack of color perceptiveness increases shade perceptiveness?
but shades are colors
and color deficiency makes shades harder to distinguish
ian why D:
truth
also Ben Hur
hey brandone
yes
would you like to come play some cards against humanity and drink sometin with alex, my aunt, and I?
yes
coo coo
make tom collins
no tengo alcohol rigido
por que
spanglish ftw
umm, we went out and bought some wine
we're going for a more chill vibe
and mixing drinks takes effort
Tom Collins is chill
it has ice
now I want one
lol
good thing I have expensive gin
ice is yum
Also if you find a bottle of Tanquerey Old Tom Gin I recommend it
interesting
could make gin fizzes
i like those
or tom collins
what's in a tom collins?
tonic water, simple suger, lemon, ice, and gin
also I got the marksman dlc
woot
oh god
sugar and lemon
dont make me vomit
its 1/2 a lemon
still can't handle the thought of that combo
and a dash of syrup
essentially died from drinking too many lemon drops
dont ask why
lol
wat
sugar and lemon?
in a tom collins
or other alcoholic drink
sugar and lemon go great together
simple syrup and lemon
oh i know
they do
they are yummy
imma eat a taco then head over
but I can't stomach them
okey
we have dipping bread coming as well
Andrew: Make an aviation then
That's a good one
wassat
Gin + Violet Liquior + Marichino Liquior
Shake well with ice, strain into a martini glass
It should come out light blue
but hazy
interesting
more of a purple blue
it tastes good
i prefer orange juice mixed with sprite. stirred, not shaken
OH MAKE MIMOSAS
Orange Juice shaken with ice and sparkling white wine
or sprite
stirred
not shaken
mimosas are great
I also enjoy a good madras
i like apple juice
cranberry + orange juice + vodka
shaken
unshaken - vodka + sprite
still have not ever had a mimosa
stirred
Tony you want me to make you some drinks?
I'll start with a tom collins
hey brandog
do you happen to have our corkscrew, or a corkscrew?
a what who
a corkscrew
to open wine
man i miss halo 2 vehicles
shenanigans and rocket race
trying rebranding wth my logo
<<< 
herpaderp
Idk about the logo, it just seems to be hard to read/understand with the split words
it looks good, but it's harder to read I guess, it just doesnt flow
also that was halo 3, not halo 2
you're right it was
but those cycles man
lol I never got into halo 3 sadly, it's the only one I didnt finish the campaign on as well
the choppers were nonsense
rocket race was equal nonsense
adn of course
the ever popular Naomobile
"Changelog: Updated Stuff"
hi all
lol hi
what's new
Not much really, thinking of doing a post master course or something totally different like photography. Something to keep me busy till I get a stable contract.
How about you?
interview for an internship at 2 for me :P
nice
yep, hopefully it's not horrible. I'm great at interviews, but I've never had a technical one yet
internship usually means willingness to learn or at least should, thought it's difficult to know what they're looking for exactly
wow someone actually reads the changelog? lol
lol I did :P
lol I read the changelog up until I stopped playing
when I put "Updated: your mom" and nobody said anything I figured nobody read them
Hippos told me to just up my ram, but I think he forgot to mention that i'm on a 32bit system :x
it defaults to 1 gb
you should be able to up it to 2
hahaI only saw the latest changelog :p
or 1.5 or something
the only options I have are 512, 768 and 1gb
really? lol
well then
yup
photography is a thought
somethign i've been considering
dibs!
photo always seemed like such a pain in the ass to get started
it's a heavy investment money wise
ask gen for an internship!
expensive camera, yeah
lol
that's something I'd love to do, you should hook that up brandon >.>
yeah I should really look into it, my photos have been ok, but not great, and sometimes plain bad.
ffs
I updated mekanism and buildcraft
now new versions of both are available
lol
gne
hell
I'll Internship with Gen for post production and customer interaction
lol
how comfortable and confident must you be in your own skin to just roll with that
and not pop a semi in the meantime
I don't think customer interaction will be an issue for you :p
gen is a playboy photographer
^
the customers are beautiful naked women
lol
oh i can not pop a semi easily
it isn't haRD
anyways
i've drawn nude models before. in a professional setting all sexuality is removed
but I hear playboy is moving more towards video
I'd imagine that's a bit more sexual
could always do earth/food porn :P
maybe maybe not
video conversion would be strange
like
webms? would the content just be moving from pose to pose?
it's like sexy naked yoga and stuff
lol
hardcover 44 euro for the 4th book o_O
lol
but
there's like
free versions of that
well there's free versions of naked women
the videography and motion graphics better be on fucking point because that's what they ahve gong for them
in pictures
oops wrong window..
been looking at books, the box set of the 1-5 books of Game of thrones costs 30 euro, while the single 4th books is 44 euro's
hai
so that interview was fun
what did they ask you?
"Yes hello can you science for money?"
went well? or is my sarcasto meter broken
they had me come in and insert my first and last name into their json database, and test that it was inserted. if it was successful I made an led blink on their raspberry pi
yeah this text filter is causing some distortion
ooooh
yeah it went well
that's kinda cool
it was really cool
they stuck me with three homebrew libraries so I had never seen them before, gave me the documentation, and said go
the fuck is with these tech companies having awesome programming interviews and design companies are like, "how experienced are you" ?
that's awesome
lol because programming interviews are chill as fuck for the most part. these dudes were asking me if I wanted a beer and stuff before it lol
oh my gooooooooooooood
i'm raging but that's so awesome
i love tech companies
lol yeah originate has a fridge full of beer
yup, artists have it difficult
lol
well
brand had a fully stocked fridge with alcohol and candy and snackage
boss was a brutal passive aggressive bitch though so
lol yeah, these guys were cool
aweosme man :D
they had a giant bird shit line on their window, so they drew a butterfly over it and used the stain for the body
it was pretty funny
my kinda company
oh also, after the tech part they had me explain python ogre to them (a topic I was using that they hadnt heard of)
ooh
yeah, that part was shitty
I described it fairly well, but if they actually look it up I made a fatal flaw and forgot one of the main aspects lol
ono lol
Somehow viewports and teh root scene node became one thing in my head
so meh
but other than that I described it pretty well
especially how we use it
noice
yep
anywho
off to pack for california
I has 5x ore processing on MC now :D
I'd make a midnight dinner but I should sleep
g'night
night
gnite
how disappointing, Delain didn't do any songs with Marco in the NY show yesterday
hm?
Marco, the singer from Nightwish who provides guest vocals for a bunch of Delain's songs
osnap
they're touring together but marco isnt singing in any of their songs :(
aww
well
singing does take a lot
i imagine after rocking hard he's just like "nah"
but delain opens, then sabaton plays, then nightwish does the main act
hm
so he could do like 1 song with delain
lol
if he felt like it
then recover during sabaton
and then rock with nightwish :(
i want to hear Control the Storm or Sing to Me live with Marco :(
Ehhhh
Hi folks
hi
how's life?
good
I am waiting to go pick up a pizza
i have tacos
that sounds good
Do you want to Arma today?
perhaps later, yeah
i'm working on 3x and 5x ore processing for my base
both work, I just need to make them look pretty now
well I can't play until after my pizza
i now have all my nether ores being auto-converted to normal ore, and normal ores are being processed either at 3x or 5x depending on how valuable they are :D
sup
back from pizza
hi
was buffalo
super good
yummm tacos
welp
i accidentally unleashed hundreds of mobs that can 2-shot me in my base
what
what mobs
a mob from hardcore ender expansion
there are many variants
my auto spawner can apparently not kill one
it happens to be one capable of teleporting and damaging me with magic, which bypasses armor
I got my stuff back and unleashed holy vengeance with my flamethrower
lol
should'a nuked it
well, it's my base
and they look like spiders
so fire is the appropriate action
whatthefuck
they went invisible
there are more and they are invisible
wow
sounds safe
they are honestly terrifying
when i get near my spawner they EXPLODE and make a horrible noise
and then fly at me like an angry swarm
why were you trying to farm these?
they drop runes
which i can use for charms
for?
for enhanced speed, defense, etc
Why don't you just gravity kill them?
well, it's a general purpose spawner/grinder farm
i didnt expect this
ahhh
oh my god
this one is glitched
it has 0 health and wont die
and they dont despawn
what have I done
oh good, the others disappeared. I had to catch the unkillable one with a safari net
arma in like 20 minutes, deco?
sure
hi
deko
hi hi
im on the server
oh okay
anyone here want to give me some tinker's construct tips?
?
trying to make a fast fortune hammer to process my thousands of diamond/coal/lapis ore
cobalt hammer
what rod/binding?
pretty much cobalt everything, unless you want it to break instantly (paper tool rod)
ok, sounds easy enough
damn
i bought that on one of the steam sales
ooh
nao, you know who is admin on the server?
I have console access and op
I think I blew it up
lol i'll look
machine inventory manager is to blame I believe
clicked "make trigger" and the server went boom
about 3 hours ago
cmdr joined the server like 30 minutes ago
he seems to be using it fine
hmm
let me try joining
it might be a corrupt chunk
if it gives an error message I should be able to figure out the cause
boom
yep
said server closed
did I kick bob? :(
yes lol

no such field error?
sounds like a mod problem to me
well, it's a ticking exception
so it's bound to a block
I can fix it, but the block will go poof
that's fine
cheap as hell
any chance I cam make another one or will all of them have that problem?
no clue
i'd like to try anyway, because it's such a great way to do automation for crafting
sorry, I was skyping my GF so I was kinda distracted
anyways
I can fix it, just gimmie a sec
k, server is restarting
once it's up log on and the block should be gone
you can try again, if it still has issues the block will just disappear
once we know whether it works or not, I'll disable the config option that poofs any entity that fails to tick, since that can cause bad stuff if left on
server's back up, if you want to rejoin
Sup
hi
hi
hi
I have finished everything I wanted to do on my MC world
I am now in need of ideas
this sounds like you four weeks ago in my world
lol
This is why we need traincraft
So you can build fancy railways
for miles
and never get bored
I'm tempted to add thaumcraft/botania
eww
idk if I can add those post-world generation though
I don't think you can
they change the world generation pretty extensively
idk much about botania, but it seems like TC just needs nodes, which could be retro-gen'd and those silverwood trees
it also spawns those dungeon thngs
but those arent really necessary are they?
no not really
nao, if you add those can you see about updating the mod with the machine inventory manager and possibly adding witchery as well?
updating steve's factory manager?
yeah
it's up to date I believe
crap
now I have to try and figure out why the server hates it
there's like no official download page for it that I can find though
so it's possible I am just getting it from the wrong location
possibly it doesn't play nice with barrels
our SFM might actually be two months out of date
lol
I'll update it
I think for now I'll just add Botania, since it doesn't really have much worldgen other than flowers
and it has cool baubles
hey
hi
How goes it?
it goes well
I am building "hippo's room"
in his base
for him
wat
he doesnt know this though
i am making it as weird as possible
lol
Booby trap it
so far he has a table with a laptop, a box of tissues, a bottle of lotion, and a little girl doll
making his drugs now
lol i put a camera facing his bed with a canopy
think he'll like his new home?
Probably
clearly need moar bombs
lol
I just made me an Aviation cocktail
It was really good
however
it was very strong
well
i made pasta
it's not great
but its food
lol
I R finaree back from the californias
wb
ty
wb
you missed out on some arma
nothing big though
just a big mess
lol
look at hippo's home I built for him, Andrew
wow, fancy as fuck except for the monotone walls
lol
notice the laptop/tissues/lotion/doll combo
and the camera pointed at the bed
with chains
haha I didnt see those
and sausages on the wall
and the chemistry set for drugs
I did see that
thought it was cool
and the freaking huge pig on the table
oh wow
that is a large pig
and the pile of poop by the toilet
I saw the poop lol I thought it was a black plant
where you sit in front of a mirror as you poo
I love shitting and sitting in front of mirrors
lol
so I'm building an AE2 spatial storage room
turns out they take a lot of power
like, just a big burst of power
so I need 85 dense energy cells to buffer enough power
I could significantly reduce the power requirement but it would have to look uglier
and power/resources isnt really an issue
wtf do they need so much power for?
they store/place blocks
mine stores a 15x15x15 area
into storage cells, similarly to how items are stored in cells
so I can build something, save it to a cell, and then build something else in the room
oh nice
and just load the structure whenever I need it
that's kinda cool
I can also put myself in my own pocket with it
nao, did you happen to update stuff yet?
no
updating is a pain to do
lol
but factory manager :(
it takes like an hour or longer to update, and I just updated a few days ago >_<
I'll update it tomorrow
ok :3
spatial storage room works :D
15x15x15 is a lot larger than I expected
sup
hola
I am bored
hello bored, I am Brandon
I am Brandon
No
I
am
Brandon
I am Brandrew sometimes
Tocksman calls you Naosyth #3
yeah i know lol
tony is Naosyth #2
yes
And I'm Cave Johnson
essence altar in a 15x15x15 spatial storage room :D
that looks like magic to me
why yes, that is exactly what it is
wizrody
it allows me to do many useful things
like repair my armor
or any other item with durability
and do damage to mobs in a 6 block radius whenever I get a kill
and take less damage
......
the essence altar doesnt allow itself to be stored in a spatial storage disk
fml
that was the main reason I built this room
man, not even thermal expansion works with it
sounds like your spacial storage isnt finished being implemented
it was fully implemented back in AE1
cause you'd think those are things it'd be able to do
it's up to the other mod to integrate with spatial storage
orly
seems lame to do it that way
yes
it should at least be a config option
yeh
anywho
bed
night
night
ugh
I updated the modpack and now there are terrible visual glitches going on
and I have no clue why
o.O
I see
most modded items have weird outlines that render through blocks
hmm
removing botania fixes it
wait
no it doesnt
it was fixed for like 10 seconds
apparently EnderZoo is doing it
why would a mod that only adds mobs do something like that though?
dunno
I had a hunch it was the cause though
because in the previous update it started rendering a weird hitbox thing on wither cats
or witch cats or whatever they are
I just downgraded to the january version
that was the one with the most downloads
and the one we were using until like a week ago
the fixed pack just finished uploading
and the server's updated
awesome
if you want to test your SFM thing
ill get on very soon then
Hi
o/
Hey M31
hows it going?
pretty good, just chillaxing on mincarft :)
You should try and make it up to Vegas this summer
I can get you a room at the Palazo (4 star resort) for $99 a night
that's actually quite cheap
I take that back
Its not 4 star
its 5 diamond
so world class
price is still $99
Its also the world's largest hotel
And yes, that price is a steal
like
super
cheap
Considering they are normally, at the aboslute cheapest, $290 a night
hi
hi
greetings
greetongs
psssstttt andrewwww
Arma tonight Brandrew?
i am trying to write this stupid 8086 program
it is stupid and makes no sense and doesnt work
make it download a virus
for lolz
i cant even find the max value in an array
making it download a virus would be much harder
I've never used 8086
I used it for a semester like 2 years ago
but this is different
What are you trying to do?
find the max value in an array
oh thats the end goal?
yeah
there are like no examples of how to do this anywhere
and what I do find doesn't go with what he gave us for our data segment
hmmm
Brandon, I believe in you
just dig in stackoverflow long enough
and you'll get it
i found someone else asking about this on stack overflow
the questions were 15 hours old and 1 hour old
lol
both from my class I am guessing
That's probably it
The logic is easy, it's a simple program
but all of the values I'm getting are wrong
welp, if I ignore how my teacher said to structure our data, then I am able to at least read and modify variables
Its possible your teacher told you wrong
yeah, but he claims to do all of the homework assignments himself before assigning them
I've heard that many times
Did you solve it?
i may have
mmmnope, not yet
if you solve it want to play arma?
yeah, might be a while though
oooh i think I got it, but I still have problem #2
It should hopefully be easy
Whats problem 2?
variables G,H,I, and J have 4, 5, 1, and 2 in them respectively. I have to compute f=(g+h)-(i+j)
which is easy, except idk what registers to use
well
which ever one has the shortest line!
lol
aha I got it :D
holy shit Daredevil is a violent show
jeeze
jeeze
woo
So arma in a bit?
yeah, gotta add some comments and get the files ready to turn in first
kk
files are ready, lemme take a quick look at why herp's tesseracts stopped working after the pack update then I can arma
cool
welp, i crashed the server
10/10
ok
all is fixed
well
kk
it's still broken
but a suitable temporary solution has been found
its all your fault
hi
hi
hi
indeed
hi
i am tired
i want to sleep
I second that
thirded
Ok, we're all in agreement
let's sleep
yep, time to arma
i cant arma
I know, you're not here
indeed
I CAN SEE YOUR LIFE
yes
I have to stick around campus until class at 2:30 :(
alright
that looks like fun
at least until everyone leaves you hanging
or until you pull the paint off the ceiling and fall onto the table, and shatter that and impale yourself with the beer bottles and wine glasses on the table
and die
psh
D:
seemed like a likely scenario to me
I see peril in every corner aswell :P
lol
so i got these green apple mike and ikes for easter
they have real fruit juice from concentrate in them
the ingredients: fruit juice from concentrate (pear, orange, strawberry, cherry, lime, lemon)
there is no apple in sour green apple
lol
was that a drone?
skills with tools
it was a drone
lol
Looks like a drone :P
the apes now have our tech!
top comment on reddit: "I especially like the look he gets on his face when he whacks it."
top response to that: "Gross, man"
lol
lol
oh hey so brandon
do you think you could teach me the ways of blender converting to ogre meshes?
lol
cause I need to make boatz
hardy just asked the same
lol
turns out its a lot of work
and I dont remember how to do it
but my laptop is still set up for it
gotcha
so if you want to just export via my laptop thats fine with me
okey
that'd be good I think
so basically just make the mesh in blender and move it to your laptop, export, gg?
yesh
okey, sounds good to me
thanks
sushil said we should just download the meshes
which I may do
because making my own in blender takes time
but its fun
oh i know it would be
but I have lots of shit to do lol
good god
this game is kinda cool
voxel, turn based fully destructable xcom type game
hey brandog, what file format do the meshes need to be from blender to convert to ogre?
Hi folks
Fi Holks
lohi
Hows it going?

Porque no trabajo?
(why not work? or because no work?)
Why no work?

I am testing this mod can unlock much much larger maps
that sounds nice
oh did you see the fully connected 6-way intersection on reddit like... yesterday?
Yes
Its much cleaner than mine
that thing was epic
yeah that's like 900% planning
freeways are always an afterthought for me
trains are planned though
lol
trains carry more people
they're less efficient travel for those people though
Deal with it
Urban lyfe yo

No

I operate a UAV
and be invincible
and brandon
does nothing
lol
Subs are the safest mode of travel
wow, good guy from EA donated 500 dollars to EA's own humble bundle, bumping the average up like 34 cents
could you imagine if he was the first person to donate?
the average would be so high for the first hundred people that nobody would get the extras
...
-_- good guy ea
lol that would be hilarious
if I was super rich I would do that
lol
sup folks

pain in the ass
P.I.T.A.
oh
lol
i like websites
PETA
wabsoots are animal rights activists
lol
Actually had pita's today
didn't use them in a conventional pita recipe however
i havent had a pita in a really long time
I made mini pizzas with them :p
Indeed
yummy
oh yum
indeed, pretty easy aswell
italian herbs mixed with ketchup make the tomato base :x
ghetto cooking with ment
that actually sounds like it'd work. It'd be really salty though
ghetto cooking with ment, I'd watch it
I would as well lol
it wasn't too salty
haha
I attempted to cook yesterday, but it ended up being pretty bad >_<
some pineapple, ham, cheese, made up for the saltiness I guess
what'd you make?
try to make*
tomato basil salmon with parmesan
and sauteed spinach
hmm sounds good actually, but not sure i'd have done that with salmon
sounds like something you'd use cod or another white fish
how'd you cook it?
I followed the directions but the salmon was undercooked so I had to throw it back in the oven for like 10-15 minutes
aha
And the spinach was waaaay too soggy
Sauteed spinach doesnt really sound that good to me
I ended up cooking it for another 8ish minutes then drying it off with a towel
it was alright after drying it out
I made little caesars pizza
so meow
I usually wrap the fish in foil and place it in the oven
lol
parmesan and salmot...erm
that goes nicely actually
its what the recipe said! it looked good
depends on teh textures I think
salmon and parm would be delicious regardless, unless you don't like salmon or parm
lol
i don't like salmot
lvoe parm
why salmot
salmoNNNNNN
salmot y u so
Just last week I had some salmon with potato gratin, creme fraiche and some parmesan
salmot pls
lol
i'd eat what ment cooks
i would
xD
yeah me3
doctors dinner meetup at ment's place? :D
ment come to murica and cook for us
xD sure
It's on my list
good night all
night
btw saw that hearthstone is available on mobile now?
...hm
Probably shouldn't have mentioned xD
haha yeah, i have it installed on my phone now, but I think imma uninstall it to remove the temptation to ignore my classes
Indeed
Alrighty i'm off
o/ tah~
good talking

Today was not a good arma day
lol
I think I prefer the old gun we were using
I forgot its name
oh
the rahim
yeah
its cheaper
I still ike my MG
cheaper and it works fine
I'm better with it at range and at close range they're basically on par with each other
unless fighting a vehicle maybe
I didnt really like the rahim
dunno why
it works so well with the nightstalker
the ranging matches quite well
I also didnt like the nightstalker
because so expensive
but its so good
and I died a lot
so i had no moneys
also money is basically as common as air
money is common as air if you dont die
lol
I died
woah, a whole death?
damn

howdy partner
I want mexican
me too
dunno where to get it though
well there's this awesome restaurant not too far from me-- oh wait you guys are a whole state away (cat)
Vegas has no shortage of mexican food
There's just no middle ground
nor does socal
its either fancy restaraunt, or trashy dive place
but yeah there's this family owned restaurant that's been around for like 60+ years and it's freaking awesome
and it's on route 66
I had a hamburger
from a place in Boulder City
I had a hotpocket from a box in my freezer
dats nasty
it was good
was it a hot pocket hot pocket?
jalapeno chicken
dats nasty
it was yum yum
hot pockets don't count as food
^
haters gonna hate
they hate us cuz they anus
whats everyone up to?
updating modpack
waiting for something to happen
^
I am doing that
ughhh Ender Storage isnt compatible with the new Forge 1355+ fluid changes
:F
too bad no traincraft
too bad Forge made a breaking non-backwards compatible change
some mods require 1355+ now, while others do not work at all with 1355
>.>
10/10 great planning
TiCon and Extra Utils both require 1355+
and both of those have stuff I want in the updates
you guys up for some arma?
in a bit sure
^
I'm just gonna delay updating the pack until this forge business gets resolved
or maybe I'll just leave TiCon and Extra Utils at the current version
either way, I'm not going to finish updating right now
so I'm ready to Arma whenever you guys are
I'm ready pretty much

whats maraarmaram

oh lol
well
I don't know what Brandon's up to
I have some HW to do
kk
np, ill just be on youtube/poe for a while since I have nothing else to do
until dinner time that is
hai
o/
hey
wassap
so hungry.... and free outback for dinner
sounds like my dad is now calling my mom so ill be leaving in a few
yummy
outback is delicious
their coconut shrimp and their mushrooms they have as an addon for steak dishes are amazing
outback's service out here is atrocious
I do remember that
bloomin onion
I went with alex once
most restaurants out here have awesome service
california restaurants dont have much coice
they have to be good to survive
true
Vegas has so many tourists that they'll eat anywhere
so we have a massive mix of food qualities
ricardos #1 restaurant
la Paloma #1 restaurant :)
blasphemy
^
Mexican food wars
You've never been to Ricardos
you've never been to la paloma
ricardos is like heaven, but with delicious salsa and chips and steak and bean dip and tea and service
does La Paloma have the world larges margarita?
i dont think so!
Cantina Laredo is also really good
no, but their salsa is damn good, and who needs a giant margarita when it tastes so good?
bigger != better
Ricardos has been a Vegas staple for ages
no, but much much bigger == much much more drunk
Its so successful its open 24/7
They've been open since like '78
Everyone who is old Vegas goes there
They are so popular that if you want to have your Christmas party there you have to book it in May
la Paloma has been open since '66
holy crap
Now you see how they stay open 24/7
indeed
how much is it?
They also have a full service bar open 24/7
Its $12-$18 a plate
ouch
depending on what you get
There is cheaper stuff
but that's most of the menu
steak is like 18
oh btw I finished my homework
most other things are like 14
if we want to arma
Did I mention Ricardos delivers?
cause they do
especial de la casa on the bottom left
enough for 4 people
$10
tastes like heaven
But, is it Ricardos?
^
it is not
It's basically a requirement to love Ricardos if you want to be a Doctor
well, we didnt love it until we went there
so he just needs to go there
Yup
He is unenlightened
indeed
yup
His restraunt reminds me of Casa Flores down in Boulder City
basically an old town mexican place
^
family owned and operated
oh that looks excellent
Ricardos has been owned by the same Family the whole time
given the name, I assumed as much
in fact, they've had the same fat mexican waiter my whole life
lol
lol
Brandon and Tony know who I mean
yup
I mean
yis
Even when I was a baby
That guy
was our waiter
lol
that's a long time to be a waiter
loooong time
I just had tacos
i had taquitos earlier
so now we just need m31 to come back
and we could have
count
players
boo boo
what did you cut yourself?
and get a boo boo
pssh
4 players?
FOUR!
FOUR WHAT
Arma players
o
Tony could totally get arma
AND THEN WE WOULD HAVE FIVE
5 COUNT EM
F.I.V.E.
but i have all these GTA games to play
Arma super fun
combat party
Fight Dave
super fun
join the good fight
fight the Dave
we'll die in our mission to take down Dave but dammit we'll put up a mediocre resistance
Get it for cheap
$38?
Yes
pass
Its full price is $60
Its worth it
it is
best combat game out there
no questions asked
we have many good fun times
why
just last night
arma i believe, I've only heard great stories from it
I shoved a submarine in a rock and it it rocked back out at me, killing me and flinging me at least 20 feet
I HATE FPS games
and I love Arma
then deco revived me and I went in the ocean looking for the submarine carcass and found someone's hidden stash
Tony, when was the last time I said "Lets play a shooter?"
also I unloaded an entire clip point blank into Chris P. Chicken
you've never said that ian
Exactly
Which is how you know arma is amazing
my poor SSD only has 13gb of space left :(

Guys
I went on their forums
and learned
how
to Allahu Akbar
?
Aka blow yourself up after death
lol
you need an explosive charge or explosive satchel
on you
when you die
lol
so we could die in a crowed place
then allahu akbar
XD
i'd prefer not to die on purpose with my current gun though
its a last resort kinda deal
so always good to carry the explosives
looks like the note 3 is finally getting a lollipop update
anyone know what server it is we play arma on? I want to play :3
Yeah
a3wasteland altis
a3armory?
one of those
lol
so, if you have the explosive on you when you die, it just booms no matter what?
I believe so
because I've died with explosives on me and I am pretty sure I didnt boom
maybe you have to equip them
i dont think that is possible
I heard you have to have it in your vest and then it gives you the option to boom
but that didnt work for me
I think you have to set a radio trigger for the explosive
and when you die, you just use the radio trigger
but if you are dead how do you do that?
when you respawn I'm guessing the trigger still exists
I know if you place it you can remotely touch them off
no, I dont think that's it
deadman switch? :P
yeah idk, where's deco when you need him
you should play arma with meh
interesting
I could have killed that guy that stabalized my body
he was sitting right on my dead body
lol
whhy did he do that?
I think I even had an explosive charge on me
idk
he then killed everyone else
so I suicided
guess he wanted you to suffer
or something
lol
he probably meant to treat himeself and hit the wrong option
probably
lol
lol
silly people, dave doesnt hack, he's just death incarnate
last night we became Dave
we became that which we sought to destroy
and we brought death to many
MANY
lol
hi
I am home
from work
ello
hello
chello
sup everyjuan
nadda
playin monster hunter
I see you guys told Andrew we am become dave
yes
I am also going to always keep explosive charges on me now
So you read up on that?
yeah
that would have been so great that one time the guy in the wet suit killed us all
he was just standing on my body forever
yeah
would have been great
to
it would have been so so so so SO satisfying
"do your duty"
lol
i'll due it alright
its been a long day
indeed it has
we should get andrew to join us tonight
I has to skype at like 8:30ish tonight
let us know when you're done
i'll probably be done around 10-10:30
I figured as such
this wobsite
wobsute
i suck at figuring out what pictures to use
wubsit
i recommend tacos
thoughts of that one?
it looks nice
lol "WHAT DO"
lol at the text
Is that latin at the end
yes
it sounds like latin
does it speak profession though?
I translated it and it seems like garbage
"celtics great poverty minneapolis"
wat
i didnt know latin has a word for minneapolis
google translate >_>
look up lorem ipsum
i know lorem ipsum
there's a hotkey for it in sublime text
it's a fragment of that lol
oh nice
i only know the first two words of lorem ipsum though
lol
same
i think some transparency with the top bar could be cool
I've seen a lot of sites lately make the top bar transition in size/opacity when you scroll
it changes in minor transparency i'll see where that detail is
"coming out simulat..."
creeping on your bookmarks
lol
actually a very interesting game
i recall the dev was a complete twit
lol
but still it was like "dude this whole thing is awkward how the hell"
sooo fellas up for some arma
?
I am
We're waiting on that brandon guy
to stop talking
oh thats right
to his lady friend
that doesnt stop for several hours sometimes
we could start without him and let him join after
He started at 8:00ish
yeah
4hrs of debate over morals isn't unheard of
we could ask him
what his status is
we kind of are
I could try texting him
Por favor amigo
but my phone has 16 minutes of installation left for lollipop
and is unavailable for use til then
so you could :3
lol
lol
Still skyping
wie lange?
we'll finish around 10:30 most likely
mind if we start?
you guys can start without me
go for it
kk
kkk

can you make a submit logo?
maybe just like "submit" written with a nice font and the i could look like an upload icon
nice font, not the ugly one :x
yeah no ugly fonts
Comic Sans
also hi
hi
did you make your button?
?
on my website?
I assume that's what you wanted a submit for
i made the new file button
ah
bu the site is called "Submit"
which is what the logo is for
what is the site for?
senior project
ah
ohai
hai
today was interesting
my poor boss was in a state of delirium
i needed her keys for the back office so she handed me a staple-remover.
took her a second lol
lol
lol
lol
we gonna arma tonight?
yes
im down
woo
i need new snacks to eat during arma
you know "Snacks" would be a good callsign for me too
o.O
I might be able to arma later on
lol
string cheese
Tony needs a callsign
Tony needs Amra 3
^
Arma 3 too
tony callsign
call me
Crunch
no you dont get a callsign because you dont have the game
My callsign will be The Game
no
THE GAME
no
<<< 
no
<<< 
no
x_x
tony's callsign (when he gets 50 kills) is gonna be Amra
Tony can be call sign "Very Punny"
that works
no
Punny or Amra
Tony needs the game first
THE GAME yes
no
lol
cheapest ever was june 23  for $30
i got it + all DLC for $38
does everyone have all dlc?
no
like a few weeks ago
no
same
you dont need the DLC to play
DLC just gives you extra goodies
nah, but the marksman one is really nice
all the dlc mechanics are free
each DLC adds improvements like better bullet physics as well as content like guns
guns will nag you to get the DLC if you try to use them
you just get stupid spammy Dlc thingies on your screen
Also vehicle and helicopter physics
but it wont lock you out of DLC servers or anything
yeah
95% of the DLC is under the hood stuff everyone gets for free
5% is new equipment
oh that's charitable <3
lol wow
I am grading papers.. this guy had his 219 HW stuck in his 326 HW
so, I guess he didn't manage to turn in his 219 HW
which means he lost an instant 30% on it
GG
damn
poor fella
Harris was looking at next semester's class catalog during our lab meeting
every single class he looked at was full with a waiting list of like 12+ people
including required classes
He said Nancy will have to at least increase the number of seats for Automata to 35 I think though
so if you're still on the waiting list for that I think you'll get in it
that would be nice
I still need to email her
also senior projects has 75 people enrolled in it lol
yeahhh I finally got a spot
what do you need to email her about?
thank god
just to see if she thought I would get in or something, idk. alex said I should email her and try to get in
so did somebody else but I forget who
what spot are you on the list?
Idk now, i was 18th
but there were only 25 enrolled at that point
Well, harris said she needs to make it at least have half as many seats as senior projects
which has 75
they had like 10 spots reserved for grad students, and only two of those were filled
it's funny, when I took it we had like 25-28 people i believe
and she was begging us to drop it and take it the following semester
because that was too many
well nobody took it this semester cause yakov was teaching
and the semester before that it had like 12 people
whoa
uh has anyone been listening to the Hunt The Truth podcasts for Halo 5 marketing?
nope
nop
voiced by a dude in Key and Peele
Andrew what time do you think you can play?
not til like 10 probably
:F
the misconceptions these people have about how memory/programs work is very annoying
it makes grading this take forever
prog lang?
I have to keep writing the same big long explanation about why they are wrong on every paper
yeah
what're they working on?
lol get a stamp
i've been grading #1 for like 3 hours
writing the same thing over and over and over and over
yeeeep
even with both of us working on them we missed some of those
pretty sure I got 100% on this hw
lol
they really aren't very intuitive until you realize exactly what you're working with
well yeah
this HW is an easy one if you know how stuff works
I'm just saying questions like those
lol
we did
which was nice
lol this is the one HW assignment i dont have, so I can't actually check what I got
but I only got less than an A on one assignment
I did on two of them because on one I forgot to actually write the second half of a question lol
a few people have done that so far
Show that it is impossible to
write such a general-purpose swap subroutine
that one got me when I first looked at it, I remember
I just didnt know how to answer
yeah that one wont be fun to grade
lol
yeah I don't envy you with this class' grading lol
it was lots of out of the box thinking compared to other classes
which just seems like there'd be ridiculous variance in answers
well it's easy to identify whether they are right or wrong, it's just a pain explaining why they are wrong
but
grading the java program will probably suck far more
I am not looking forward to that at all
volcano erupted in Chile
finally finished grading #1!!! :D
oy
chile peppers in mexican food make many volcanos erupt, so I guess it's a fair exchange
D:
lol too soon?
did the volcano actually do anything?
yes
lol dunno
oh it did
it propelled the earth out of its orbit
lel
we are all dead
also it erupted
20km evacuation radius
still around 10 guys? :/
anyways I am hungry and i dont want to cook food

you missed our flash mob yesterday tony
^

it was awesome

lol
<<< 
<<< "I work at the redundant department of redundancy is where I work at" - Ian
the redundancy department of redundancy*
yes
lol
erryone needs their callsigns already
i am Sick Air, although I also like Snacks
lol
Tony can be MIA
lol
and he's more free than any daughter
(presumed dead)
"Mia"
lol
but yeah
hardly anyone was on
so we were at a gun store when an ally came running up
so i started playing a stupid song over direct voice chat
and we all danced in unison around him
and he joined in
in the middle of the fight he stopped to shoot a vehicle out of the sky and then kept dancing
lol oh wow
it was pretty great
we also took go karts and a freedom tank off of jumps
i think next time we all ought to rip our uniforms off when we start dancing
and dropped helicopters and cars on things
Ian was trying to kill brandon and me with them
lol
we should
boat bombing
you can rip off your unifrosm?
take it off, yeah
yup
I would like to bring attention to the fact that he swapped two sets of letters in uniforms, both the or and the ms
that takes dedication
i wonder if arby's sauce would be good on these chips
arbys sounds amazing
i had arbeez yesterday
turns out arby's sauce isnt half bad on tortilla chips
rb sauce is good
lol
sooooo arma?
rubidium sauce doesnt sound good
sounds radioactive
RBs
yayyy finished grading #4
only have EC left
i just found like the swaggiest song
swagswagswagswagswagswag
it's like
so poppy but so intense
interesting
lol
it's such a mashup
"It's better than drugs in fact it's sent from above"
oy lol
it's a fun song
you guys like really hard music
lol kinda
do not judge my tastes on taht one song that song is speshul
i just like music that makes me feel
this one makes me feel like being violently romantic
lol
What would you say your favourite song is then?
or a song most representative of your taste
three days grace -- fallen angel
I like that one right now
currently I've been listening to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wGdw4ZuXf0 a lot
most representative...
she is very white
it reminds me about how they won't be doing this song or any of their other songs with Marco at the concert :(
She has my skin colour
<.<
aka very white
nothing wrong with white!
never said there was
alex is very white
lol
you god damn racist
haha
lol
you guys must really like that heavy guitar sound
depends
there's a lot of metal I can't stand
representative....ffffuuuuueeeeck
i do quite like Marco's vocals though
representative?
tony likes breaking benjamin
there's your answer
totally debated on throwing a BB song up there too
i know
lol
lol
guess which one
Blow Me Away?
mah boi
lol
That song is more my taste towards instrumentation
guitar is lead in this case, but the sound doesn't dominate the song
i think you'd like this Ian: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxrTGMijT6k&index=7&list=PL6905BFA63B781B96
similar instrumentation with some hop
I've heard that before.
I do like instrumental hip hop most the time
ooh, I actually have a better song to represent my liking
STARSET
yo
My Demons
oh i like the whole cd
I own it
lol
lol yeah
oh nice
but antigravity just gets my mellow going like no other
which is cool
lol awesome
I take it none of you guys listen to psychedellic
depends on your def of it
I have a pretty traditional definition of it
I used to hang with a group of seniors when I was a sophomore in high school, and they listened to this kind of stuff. I called it stoner music
lol
stoners love it
its true
oh yis
i liek it
it's like tacos to their ears
[6:59:59 PM] Brandon Worl: it's like tacos to their ears
Quote of the day
lolol
ahhh yisss i got quote of the day!
lol
here another representation of it
other side
although both those songs I chose have a common theme
Also this:
Its still psych, but harder rock
less
synth
compared to my previous one
I just like songs that basically say, "I am here to fuck. Shit. Up."
i read that as "Shut. Up." at first
was slightly confused
lol
lol
takes on an ENTIRELY DIFFERENT meaning
yup
lol
This is the song I am most excited to see live: https://youtu.be/HEvFwmwvltg
and they have played it at every show so far :D
same for Ghost Love Score :D
I like how frantic the violin sounds, and the ferocity of the lyrics in the later half of the song
reminds me of Nightfall by Tony Anthem and Axl Ender
arma?
oh NOW you want to arma -_-
lol
I can til 9
so sure
well I am done grading for now
lol
decoson?
decoswan

How was arby's
we got in-n-out
how was that
it was good
I had guacamole
with chips
so I didn't pull a brandon and just eat dip-less chips
lol
I feel like it'd be hard to determine a winner without extreme bodily harm
lol second comment, It's not a fighting league, it's russian DnD
lol
Maybe they award points similar to fencing/boxing. It would be something i'd watch though
The venue should be made to fit the them though, a bit larger and some safety for the ref
quite cool how they managed to set it up...
great study for ren faires actually...
indeed
lol
lol
lol
best music video ever
this is great

Don't think they make many more like this anymore

2nd from left looks skeptical
same for the one on the right
seriously skeptical
2nd from right looks bored
middle dude looks jacked
guy on the left looks like he's just there because he was told to be there
i'm just here to avoid being fined
lol
he looks like a video game character
like some guy that's just rediculously over powered and run around smashing nazis
with a handheld 50 cal machine gun
that fires 50 cal grenades
did you see that music vid I posted? ^

"THE PROCESS
It starts with an idea. It comes to life with design. Your brand deserves a personal touch. Rather than a one-size-fits-all process, each new challenge is met with a hands-on approach, custom-tailored to you and your needs. What results is a highly polished production that reflects your passion in a positive, professional way. Your idea is unique, and it deserves to shine."

Hallo
hai
h
I was playing on another server for a bit earlier and got 6 kills with the rahim
it was pretty fun
the rahim is a great gun
just camped the neutral general store they had
Rahim is a sold platform
Brandon and I used it religiously before the update for a reason
I still use it quite a bit
I just use muh machine gun
the Navid is a great gun
OP
yeah i feel like it shouldnt be nearly as accurate as it is lol
Have you tried the Zafir?
its equally as accurate
They both take ~8 shots to accurately down a guy at >800m though
yeah I tried it a bit
well hell, it takes me like 8 shots too with a Rahim
When I use the Rahim its 2-3 for me
it's 2-3 on a good day for me
but good days are rare
usually I shoot and see them flinch and a puff of smoke on their head and they just go on with their day as if nothing happened
lol
Then I spray my gun and kill them
I was getting 1-shots with mine because I was under 300m from the store in a tree lol
do we wanna play until i get alex at 10?
sure
Mk.18 doesn't have the velocity to hit stuff at distance, or I'd use it
I can in a bit
you guys can start though
imma finish installing latex on my VM first
30 seconds later...
lol
it takes forever to install so I want to get it going while we play
why so long? it took no time at all for me
well, it only takes like 3-4 minutes but the default package doesn't have some thing this Sublime plugin requires
and it's nice being able to just hit a key combo and have the pdf get generated
that would be nice
or maybe the default didnt have some Latex package our paper is using
i dont remember
all I know is I have to install the full version
which takes longer
well this is cool: http://i.imgur.com/a1mi760.webm
that the chile volcano?
yeah
pretty neat
100% would nope if I lived below that thing

hi
want to play a different game?
game mode or game?
either
mayhaps
I have no ideas though
we should play a game that doesnt require skype/mumble/voice chat
because alex is doign work
Brandon and I both did our duty
yup
on the server we were on?
no on wasteland
i want to wasteland
grotongs docktorz
hi
how ya doin?
gud
I still want to wasteland
lol
hi
hola
not bad
Hmm what to make for dinner tomorrow :P
gourmet grilled cheese
hmm, what makes it gourmet
actually sounds like a plan
just good cheese and bread, and season it up with some garlic and stuff
yummy
easy :D
seems gabe newell is doing an ama
I don't reddit so lol
oh good, reddit can ruin his day with protests on paid mods :P
indeed
So my mom is looking to start a blog on cooking, anyone have an opinion on particular blogging sites being better/worse?
never really looked into blogs
Me neither
LaTeX is the biggest pain in the ass
yep
I can not get these figures to position correctly in this two column layout
Hi
hi
I played that capture the island mode again last night
it was really great
I got a ton of practice at close range
which is what we suck at
also the open sights on the cyrus work great at up to 300m
i think we might suck a bit less at close range if we didn't always fight close range with long range weapons
I got like 9 kills with the cyrus in close quarters
though I had open sights
it works grreat for that
sup folks
hi
I am bored
I am writing OS code
no funz
no funz at all
literally just spent 10 minutes trying to figure out why one of my functions wasn't declared "in this scope" when it looked fine
turns out I had named it with a zero instead of an "oh" (o) on accident
first time i've had that problem
I promptly switched fonts to something more noticible
i am trying to do 219 hw
no clue how to do this
wat is?
cache addressing stuff
fully associative, set associative, etc
that sounds like something I did not pay attention to because it sounded hard
lol
lol either that or eggbert never taught it, which is also likely
I am hunger
"hello hunger, my name is (insert name)"
I am also bored

hi
hi
hi
this opsys hw is dreadful
this 219 hw is meh
was up til 3 last night, been working since 11 this morning, and I still have at least 5 hours of work to do
like... 17 hours spent on it already
wow
boreddd
feel like coming over and helping me solve this problem? :P
first part is relevant
vgh
lol
what problem?
una problema
body minus a head in the garage apparently
lol
lol
my OS thingy si having some issues
and I've been trying to find the cause for like two hours
:F
The cause is you did something wrong
^
can confirm, made that mistake once or twice before too
if it were me
I would have mistyped
one thing
somewhere
and would have to dig
Mekanism was holding up my modpack from updating to the new version of Forge, and they kept saying on Github that they would release the update soon (over a week ago)
so I just downloaded their dev branch and compiled the jar files myself :D
and it actually works
lol
unfortunately all my frame microblocks became glitched
so RIP tunnel bore
RIP IN PAX
Whats everyone up to?
nm
same
has there been no mention of arma today? :O
way to blow it
no
now it has been mentioned

the bag should have lapis in it though, not gold
lol
hi
Hello
How are you?
i am good
a bit bored
I am making dinner
then we should do something
yes
suggestions?
perhaps we could harass the central gun store
with drones
and our artillery
assuming our truck is alive
imma log in and check
lol
are you ready for skype/playing then?
not yet
gonna eat right after I check
k
WOOO
THE TRUCK LIVES
okay
be back in like 10
k
arma going down today
?
yup
when we logged off we had a resuply truck + mortar + drones
o.o
I was flying my drone around spotting targets, then deco rained death upon them
lol
back
problem though
when I was on
there was dave
lol
we will rain death upon dave
And he'll probably buy a mortar and return fire
but we will win! because i say so!
uhh we can try it

maplestory was a blash
it was great
the new versions of it are horrible
i enjoyed leveling in roonskape with friends
but back in the day it was great
maplestory: MMO Gunbound

Sabaton looks like they put on a really good live show
now I am even more excited for concert
so apparently paid mods went away
ya
ja
ga
so tony you're still good to go see nightwish/delain/sabaton on thursday right?
Also to buy arma
¿a dónde fue tony?
so
kerbal released today
indeed
looks like lots of good changes too
and you can get killed by the sound barrier now
RIP bob
lol
Also jet engines behave like jet engines now
and not like potato powered rockets
Moar air = moar power
sound barrier is real mang
mach 3 = BOOM
lol
cleary my plane needs to be redesigned
clearly, it goes TOO fast
no no no
speed is no issue
its shap
mach 3 at sea level is my goal
without blowing up
I am convinved its not possible
lol
Mach 2.4
Still working
Mach 2.6
nope
That thing can enter orbit though
by pointing it straight up
its also possible to resupply by mining
which is cool
arr
arrrr
arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrg
I have to grade this entire assignment by tonight :l
Latvian Roulette, is like Russian Roulette but use semi-auto pistol.'
wat
wat assignment?
prolog programming assignment
do you only have to grade one?
or a bunch
he wants it back by monday at noon but I am in vegas until like 8pm on monday
i have to grade like 45
grade generously?
that's the plan
lol
but it still takes time
everyone turns it in differently
some people name it their name, most name it "hw7" so I have to rename them
"Close enough 9/10 - B. Worl"
and then some turn it in a .txt, some as .pl, one asshole did a .pdf and one retard did a .pages file, which isnt openable on windows or linux
and then some geniuses dont name their functions correctly
so I can't just automate running/testing
Someone should turn it in as a .tif
i got two .dat files
Why the hell isn't it standardized?
idk :(
you would think they would just email the file ready to run
oh boy
grading 2nd submission noqw
nothing runs
If I were the instructor, it would be "use this file format, or you get 50% off your grade"
x_x
yeahhhh
[5:45:16 PM] Brandon Worl: nothing runs
D-
Solid 60%
well, I'm not sure if it is because of the format of my test string or if his code is just broken
my test string worked for the last one but it needed extra dots after predicates for some reason
idk
x_x
just give everyone a 75%
and say you're good
lol
wait ok so thursday is the thing ok
wait shit really
wait no it's ok
?
is it ok?
we gud dawg?
dawhg mang man dude guy bro?
ooh Ian http://i.imgur.com/98mZlIS.jpg
ya we gud dawk
ok dawk
well that works
lol
have you listened to Sabaton at all?
That was on the War Thunder subreddit this morning
no
where'd you pick that up
sabatons are the metal foot pieces you wear in armor
oh on /r/design
i gave them a listen a few days ago
they are good
they sing mostly about WWI/II
nice
They also did this
About Finnish sniper Simo Hayha
Who killed 505 Soviet Soldiers with a Mosin Nagant in less than 8 months
what a Dave
He went 505 to 0
and that's only sniper shots
He's figured to have close to 350+ more
from MG fire and grenades, etc.
he must have used wallhax
I dunno about that
but he hid his breath by sniping with a mouth full of snow
so I heard
ughhh
I am not yet half way on the emailed files, but I am about half way on the paper submissions
which means a bunch of people didnt hand in a hard copy
which means I have to print their shit
10/10 students
dafuqqq
i just tested someone's code that didnt do the extra credit but the extra credit function ran and worked
and it isnt defined anywhere in their code
oh, apparently it is a built in function
i wonder how many people i saw it work for and just assumed they did it and gave them 10 ec points
oh well
....lol
what time thursday night?
and that will depend on whether or not they're calling me in Friday
I even asked my manager today if they needed me friday
"Ummm... I don't know......"
sec
lemme look
dont disappear before i find the answer
>_>
i won't lol
7:45
"I'm sorry but ANTHONY HUMPHREYS is not available now, please leave a message after the BEEP"
ok
yeah if i work friday there's no way
and it doesnt have 73 shitty openers
but i'm so down
oh thank god
thank fucking god
lol
it's just delain followed by sabaton followed by nightwish
"DO YOU LIEK BASS?!" "no..." "WELL HERE'S SOME MORE BASS" "....noooooo..."
woohoo
around 50 minutes per opener then around 2 hours, bit less for nightwish
h'okay
wait opener?
delain and sabaton
oh yay
so it should be done by midnightish
plsletmeknowasap if you cant go
my manager has a way of telling me
if i come in friday
on Thursday around 4:30pm
I leave at 5
ya know at that point
screw it
if they're gonna make me come in Friday on such late notice then they get to work with Auto Pilot Anthony
lol
antho pilot ny
Watch out for that sound barrier andrew
ok thoughts
"Buzz"
lol
?
yes
I was just installing it for later
gonna go watch the latest game of thrones episode
i swear i'm at a loss for the copy in that section
Tony: That wording croons the wallets of the type of people you are trying to sell to.
idk if it is just the screenshot but "s" in that font doesnt look right
uh
ccroon?
the middle part of it is almost invisible on my monitor
as in they open them or they shut them?
yeah that s kinda disappears
Crooning is generally a method of getting a woman to open up
Historically at least
ian is that wording good or bad
i know crooning as singing
i can't tell if it's in a sarcastic light or in a positive one
Its positive
damn cus i hate the wording
but
...hell
It sounds stupid to me
because I know
what it really means
But
yeah me too :<
To the customer
its just what they want to hear
which is why I used croon
It will also attract people who won't question your prices
hurray hooray
I should go into advertising
or not
its a demanding industry
"Fuck you commies."
^
i'd buy it
Mug or T-shirt
Deco & Son
Deco & Son
the ampersand makes it classy
indeed
lol i love that image
the cigar bro looks so full of himself
oh sorry, "Die commies"

lol
That's probably the bombadier and waist gunner
sine you like jumping to conclusions so much
lol sorry
i have that trampoline lying in wait
actually those tiny trampolines are pretty bad for jumping
you wont get much air
yeah they are...
well mine wasnt!
yours was an ankle breaker
......myess
not unlike the overinflated yoga ball
lol
it was inflated to the specified size
it got recalled for popping
lol
but youknow
mine didnt pop
we deflated it because of that didn't we?
yeah
i dont think so
i think we just yolo'd it
lol
red
gah i want to change the buzzword
iness of it
Brandon
Don't you have grading
to do
I YAM
welp, there are 6 that emailed but didnt turn in hard copies
and 3 that turned in hard copies and no digital file
welp, that's definitely the fastest I have ever graded a homework assignment
lol
is Mr Andrew here?
guess not
afk tacos
How was dem tacos
I am bark
wassap

o/
hi
so andrew could you take me to the clairport tomorrow? my flight is at 5:40 pm
i can give you a taco and gas money

well that would make it rather impossible to get there on time
lol
yeahhh lol
i will get a cab

THE PROCESS
When it comes to ideas as unique as the people who forge them, they deserve more than a one-size-fits-all approach. Every challenge is met with a personalized solution, based on the needs of you and your brand. The result is a highly polished production, reflecting the passion and professionalism of the people behind it.
It starts with an idea. It comes to life with design.
Sounds cool to me
people like that kinda shit
I know T_T BUT AT WHAT COST
You know what really grinds my gears?
Shifting at a bad time?
when people quote family guy and I don't notice until like an hour later
lol
but yeah if i had a manual that'd probably grind gears
lol
that was so meta andrew
damn
lol
Sup
Tony
Ian
What's your personal email?
well that's easy
Tony
D: aww Ian
t'will be fun
...twill
very much so >:3
lol just in time for Brandon to be flying down here and away from his comp
do'st thou not enjoy anachronic contractions?
aye good sir, thine self do'st thoroughly enjoy anachronic contractions
Now all our selves t'will be vex'd by the Dave.
lol
the dave
Plus Brandons only gone for the weekend
THE DAVE
does tony have the amra now?
Yes
well i mean
we COULD go without brandon
i'd only feel bad for like a millisecond
lol
We could also train Tony
so we don't have to put him through n00b camp
in live action
yeah brandon's kinda mean if you noob it up around him so that might be best
o rly
lol
lol no
but it sounded legit
nah
We were pretty gentle on m31
then he found an M320
and did just fine
yeah higher caliber guns make it easeir
imo
Depends on the range
<100m big guns are a death ticket
also depends on the dave
lol yeah
if dave is > 1 then dead
but dave is death regardless
yeah
in python you'd say that
for player in server.players:
   if player.name == "Dave":
       if player.kills > 1000000000:
           death()
since there are two daves
you have to account for innumerable kills
you may want to change it for
for player in server.players:
   if player.name == "Dave":
       if player.kills > :
           death()
Then its accurate
lol
other Dave will never get that many
yeah
lol
other dave has like 10 though doesnt he?
He probably has a few more now
I think my goal in life is to keep my killcount above other dave
real dave only has 10x the kills I do
I have like 285
he has like 
lol
only 10x
only
these characters
can't wait to meet them
Dave?
You don't meet Dave
in fact
you don't ever see Dave
You don't hear Dave
But he sees you
However; only for a moment
yup
Also did Brandon and I were discussing going camping this summer
would you be interested Tony/Andrew?
D: I want to come
lol if you got the money
D:
donde?
Dunno yet
I'd suggest north eastern nevada
Maybe stella lake
That's a glacial tarn
at alt 10,400 feet
The Ruby mountains would be a good choice too
If we did stella lake we could hike to the top of Mt Wheeler
its the 12th highest mountain in the US
I could potentially come...psssst
oh hey
um
well 1)wehn 2)arma dl'd and 3) im tired goodnight
1) Dunno yet
2) Woo
3) Alright g'night
sounds like fun to me, i'd have to have a date though before I said I could go
yeah
We'll try and hash something out soon
I hope
sounds like the beginning of a plan lol
lol
WAT
DID I SEE TONY SAY "ARMA DL'D"?!?!?!
nope
Amra
not arma
er
Amra
not tony
jeez
Amra dl'd arma
WAT
[11:01:42 PM] Brandon Worl: DID I SEE TONY SAY "ARMA DL'D"?!?!?!
yes
and I am away from my desktop :(
don't forget your sata cable
OH YEAH
im gonna grab that right now
good call
uhhh
my closet got cleaned out
idk where they are now
lol
lol
They are $3 at frys
yeah but it has to match my existing cables!
buy one in the same colour?
i found the box :D
but it is out of reach and i dont want to grab a ladder
so I will grab it tomorrow
or I will forget

hey brandone is the blender-mesh conversion thingy on your laptop or your desktop
laptop
if i sent you some meshes to convert, do you think you could do them for me before monday? totally forgot to ask til now
I can try
lol
also if you can't its fine, I just need to get some going by the final
I'll have some time tomorrow morning to try
that would be wunderbar
I have to edit my senior project website tomorrow anyways so I'll have ubuntu mode going anyways
i said anyways twice
schweet
you did
lol
lol
I will grab the meshes I found and send them your way via email
okie
guys
i am so excited for nightwish/delain/sabaton
are you now?
lol
MUCH EXCITE
EXCITE > 9000 TRUE
does blender have problems with certain file types?
i dont know
lol
okey
well i'm sending you four, kinda random file types, (.max, .obj, etc) so if they don't work thats nbd
i know obj works
coo coo
the batboat is an obj
it looks like my windows copy of blender is fully set up for exporting to ogre
I'll just try it now
and see if it works
sweet
i have bat boat open in blender, but it doesnt appear to have any texture
oh
i got it
yeah that one was weird with the textures
I tried opening that and one other .mesh (they didnt work in pyogre) and I couldnt get the texture to work in blender
glad you got it tho
lol
alt z toggles texture rendering
if it's really that simple then I would be sad
lol
lol
import obj with the mtl file in the same directory then alt z
probably the same thing with the mesh file and the ogg or something files that came with
holy hell
this medieval boat is HUGE
MASSIVE
lol
well then
didnt see that coming
lol
it is so big i can't look at it all at once
it exceeds my max draw distance in Blender
does node.scale accept negative parameters? :P
doesnt it take a percentage?
0-1
nah it takes a vec3
it looks like the medieval boat doesnt have any textures
well that's sad
but fine
or maybe it does idk
lol
lemme try importing the non obj file
hm nope cant import the other files
meh, scrap it then, nbd
we only need two boats for now
hopefully 4 for the final
super boat is reasonably scaled but lacks texture
really? it had texture on the screenshots
blender can only import a few things it seems
ah
well I may be able to texture them at some point
the superboat zip file only has a .obj file though
so if it does have textures, it's just solid colors on faces
that's fine
rather than an actual texture map
simplistic is good
lol
lol
but im not seeing any texture at all in Blender
hrmm
but the bat boat worked at least
i can send that over to you
sounds good to me
thanks
i'll see if i can find some textured, blender-friendly files for the final
do .blend files work?
i'd assume so
lol
lol i wasnt sure if it was a misnomer or something
blender's native format is .blend
gotcha
what is the .tga file?
no clue
interesting
lol
maybe something for the torque game engine?
tga does sound really familiar
truevision graphics adapter
so looking at the superboat.obj file, it was definitely supposed to have 2 files in that zip
SuperBoat.mtl and SuperBoat.obj
yeah
what happen?
lol
but it only had the .obj
interesting
yeah mine only had the obj as well
the Hamina one (.3ds) also seems to work with texture
though it's a really small model
lol
yeah i figured they'd all be different sizes
hopefully scaling it works okay
yeah scaling should be fine
Hamina gave me a ton of warnings about bad submeshes
but it'll probably be fine
sounds fine to me lol
actually the Hamina one is like 13 models
instead of 1 model
throwing stuff at a wall until something sticks is my favorite way of doing things
wut
so it exported like 13 things
lol
o.O
like the cannon barrels are all separate
and some of the lights
o.O
i might be able to merge them
O.o
>.>
<.<
lol
aha! merged!
schweeet
i dont think I can open the .c4d file to get the medieval boat with textures
and the superboat just doesnt have textures
but at least two of them worked lol
yeah that's great
thanks
np
apparently somebody in the class got their thingy working to convert as well, but they haven't shared their secrets yet :F
i'm using blender-to-ogre or something
which appears to work on windows blender
that appears to be what I am using
on blender 2.66
sweet
I might try to figure it out then
basically just grab the windows installer and install the ogre mesh xml command line dependency
so i was playing kerbal career mode, got my first craft into orbit, but its periapse is at 64km so it doesnt recognize it as an orbit, even though it will literally never decay
lol
just got home from my job interview... cautiously optimistic about this one
(one of the interviewers went to my high school, a private school with an average graduating class size of 200)
cool, what kind of stuff does the company do?
they basically do a lot of junit stuff
qa for the most part
I see
I installed junit like 3 days ago
on accident
lol
lol
it's really powerful
I've used Ruby testing frameworks before, so I assume it's similar
probably
Hallo
hello
guten tag
is dat Tony guy here?
hai
dat tony guy is probably still at work
tony and I have our concert to go to later today though
o rite
what time is dat
7:45
at the house of blues
the one on Las Vegas Blvd

my Op/sys teacher called the russian government a glorified criminal enterprise
can you tell he lived through the cold war? :P
I'd say your teacher is correct
probably
The country is controlled by the ex-KGB who formed monopolies and mobs
apparently they've been attempting to hack the white house since the beginning of april
and we havent done anything about it
Russia trys to hack stuff all the time
well to be fair so do we
It just takes a while
yeah, he made the analogy that if we had a dozen russian troops invade the white house we'd be in WWIII right now, but russia is basically doing exactly that virtually and we're not concerned
which I though was an interesting point of view
Its probably because everyone is doing it to everyone else
Honour amoung thieves
basically thats what the class said too, yeah lol
did you see my thing about the kerbal beginning orbit kerbin quest?
no
i had a stable orbit at 63km peri, 138km apoapse, and it didnt count it as a stable orbit even though above 67km is stable
so I have jeb stuck in space because I tried to fix it
and i'm pretty much broke :F
er
not 63
68km
lol
soon nao
dling music
rather transferring
Andrew
do a tonne of cheap lame flights to make money
to recover him
yeah but i just want to get to orbit :(
lol
aha
so jeb died
lol
uh...I need advice
I was watching broadcasts on steam, and in one particular was backseat playing/ helping someone
ok
what about it?
they added me as a friend on steam so I could do it again at a later date and know when they were playing
now they bought me a game off of my wishlist
I don't know this person
interesting
free game
yay
lol
Yeah but what if its some weird dude who will then expect more things from me because he thinks Im a female?
i'd just break contact with the person if they get weird
Or if its some kid without their own income and are just trying really desperately to have friends?
make sure your personal information stays personal
and if you feel their intentions are good, then keep hanging with them
if not, drop off the face of the earth
i'm sure Ian can help you with that part
lol
The only thing on my account is that Im canadiana and I think my first name
hahaha he could
its true
I will wait and talk to them before I accept it at least.
silly canadians
Or decline it
lol
I woulda taken it regardless
lol I just don't know man. Could be a trap.
Never trust strangers bearing gifts
especially if they are in a turban.
or are fascists
pretty sure steam wishlit gifts are pretty safe though
or are filthy capitalists
lol
filthy capitalists
Always be wary comrade. Always be ready for their tricks.
Weary? Wary? Wehry?
Always be hairy, comrade ;)
wearrea
english is dumb
lol
wait
I can help what?
make someone disappear from the face of the earth
you know
for science
I am convinced its wary
it is
be aware
wary
weary is tired
wheary is something you made up
wearrea is like white diarrhea
Im sure weary is like being tired
worn out
wary
lol
What makes you think I can help people disappear
you are decobro
that's your thing

Who is here?
andrew is here
is m31 here?
apparently not
eh? im here
oh?
you guys up for some late night Arma?
gimme a few mins and sure
Andrew?
I cannot sadly, got literal fucktons of stuff due tomorrow lol
:/
yehhh
I can saturday though
ah okay
yeah, and maybe tomorrow
so out of all the hearthstone cards, I am missing 8 rare, 40 epic, and 26 legendary
very close to a complete collection :P
and I have all the legendaries that I would actually ever play, so that one is basically a 0
hi
hi
nao what's the dress code and when should i be there to help out?
brandoge seems to be away from the board of keys
I must speak with the brandoge
wow
so wow
indeed
such absent
very gone
wow
lol
reload easter eggs
lol how do you activate them? (hardline i'm guessing?)
i have no idea
i think they just happen
dresscode: flamboyant? casual caribbean? terminator?
terminator
nekkid
haha, I meant leather pants/jacket
ahah
"dress terminator" "well this is awkward"
haha
.... wedding invite with no dresscode... challenge accepted
lol
so who's played arma and can tell me how to switch sight modes?
what kind of mode?
like go from a scope to ironsights?
or zoom level
scope to iron
numpad / is scope-iron
thank you
numpad +/- is zoom level
yessiree
if you run through all the tutorials you should be good on most of the mechanics
wait not for my game
yeah i'm doing a tutorial
and i can't change scope types
oh, go to options, control scheme, and select arma 2
their arma 3 setup is weird
if that doesnt fix it then the scope you have doesnt have ironsights
how to heal...
found a fix for it
but now how to heal -_-
you need a first aid or medkit
medkits are infinite use, full heals
first aid does a percentage and is single use
what button
they never gave me a button
once you're injured, if you have one of the two in your inventory, just use the scroll menu and choose "treat yourself"
ah ok
yerp
if it's a teammate who needs the healing, you run up to them, use the scroll menu and if they're dead you choose "revive", if they just need healing choose "treat <insert job here>"
keep in mind menu options like that depend on the server, but they're fairly universal on the ones we play
cool
quite the unique control schemes
yeah, the simulation aspects  become pretty apparent once you learn the controls
simulation aspects?
that scroll menu
it's not an fps/3ps, it's a combat sim. So the bullet physics, locational damage, vehicle models, and some of the survival aspects are built into the engine for realism rather than playability
it's a lovely engine
its far less buggy and crappy than the arma 2 version
but it still has some issues
lol
you can edit pitch and appearance
this gon' be good
lol
high-pitch voiced shades-wearin' camo man
lol
apparently you can change your name as well
yeah i need to find that option lol there's a name stealing andrew on the server
Configure
Profiles
lol
yeah i found it but it wont let me change my name on that profile
hi
I just created another
hi
yeah you have to createa nother
so brandog
those meshes
they are mesh.xml's
do you happen to have the mesh.xml to mesh converter installed?
:F

okie
Hi

oh
lol
I hopped on to make a TIM account
hmmm idk how I converted the xml
ah
because andrew didnt sound hardcore enough
TIMdrew
the onelusive man
sec, i'll grab the command line string from the tutorial i saw and we could try that
debating new names for this one
you guys should use your callsigns when you got 'em
SICK AIR!
try: OgreXMLConverter name.mesh.xml name.mesh
obviously from that directory
found the tool but I have to go help move food stuff
brb
no problemo

so someone broke in to my bro's car that I was driving last night
o.O
wut
#justvegasthings
It was just sitting unlocked in front of my parents house
Probably a wedding goer
nah
it was after
who saw something he wanted
and came back
later
that car is a mess
a MESS
lol
what'd they steal?
also the wedding was at a park nowhere near the house
an aux cable and a broken charger
BF4 physics
well that's not horrible
Arma physics are way better
lol
did you see nao fly?
I saw nao fly
lol
but yeah. i just filled the tank on the corolla yesterday
you can't C4 a tank to kill a jet in arma though
someone was like "I'll agree to that when Naos fly!" and they did
and i think they may have siphoned it
well that's the most expensive thing they took
lol
yeah
That North Las Vegas life
fairly lucky if you really think about it
they didnt take the stereo faceplate at least
they hit all the unlocked cars on my street
stole a neighbor's garage remote
it's just good that they didnt steal all the wedding gifts that were in my mom's car
that's good
I am 23 today
That sounds old
Happy Birthday!!
Thanks :D
23 isn't old :P
*makes toast with teamug
Tea sounds good
Happy birthday Ian :D
Thanks :D
Welcome :D how's it been?
Pretty good actually
noice
I am arma
i am bed soon

happy day after birthday Ian! :D
Thanks :D
Happy-antes-de-birthday from me as well! :D how was it?
It was pretty boring
but in a relaxing way
relaxing is my favorite kind of day
Is Brandog home
nein
dang
flight is at 8:30
late flight
yep
i wanted to play arma today
got caught in a good conversation instead
Brandons still may not be home
._.
wat
He had to fly out in a storm
ooooh
Assuming he was SWA1973
He's there
since 9:45
So he's probably in baggage claim
Should I stalk him?
While he's gone?
brandog is home now
I just got him
coo
coo
cachoo
I am snooping your github
my kitchen lights were on when I got home
they were off when I left
o.O
wizrods?
dunno
probably the apartment complex
gonna review security footage
lol
lol
sooo amra?
*arma with amra?
aamraa
araam
advanced radar-guided air to air missile
PCML
so
are we gon do it?
sec
watching this clip
wut boot dat tony
tomorrow :<
weird
i definitely turned the light off
verified by security camera
but then in the next clip it is on for no visible reason
that's odd
spooks?
maybe it didnt detect the motion of some covert peeps?
it turned on < 4 hours after I left
o.O
tony y u no amra tonight
well, nothing seems to have been touched and nobody is hiding in my apartment
lol
you could probably ask the apartment peeps if they entered
its also possible that when you turned it off the switch stuck a bit and eventually flipped back over
ahhhh, tribes 2 how ive missed thee
the switch may have only been half-way pressed and just popped back to the on position
yes
lol
drake made me download it on this computer :)
oh, the light turned back on 4 minutes after I left
o.O
I'm guessing it was just the switch
oh well, my plant got some light at least lol
lol
?
I have a gun so I wasn't really worried about people
damn you Skype and your bolding asterisk phrases
that's the car my bro and his wife drove away on after they exchanged vows
._.
pretty damn awesome
he helped build it
the next art car he's working on is funded by the guy who owns the empire state building
unlimited budget

oh btw i'm fully done with engr comm
I have an 83, a b, and I dont' have to take the final because it wouldnt bump me above a b
lol
isnt the final required?
nah, candice isn't requiring it anymore. just had to email her and say "i'm good with my 83" and she was all "very nice, your folder will be ready to pick up at 1pm"
nice
yep, one down and four to go :F
so when are we gonna go to the office?
lol.. just had a fright
but realised Ididn't have to go qo any office
...doh
lol
o_o
my grade for the last homework in CS 219 got entered wrong
I have an 88/60 instead of an 88%
So
My lawyer
got my ticket reduced
to non-moving
so no points or anything will be applied
and got my fine reduced
by $50
nice
brandog
wanna go now?
alex and I were at the school/getting dinner til just now
are they open still?
no idea
i believe they close at 5
gotcha
they close at 6 apparently
according to alex anyway
ok then lets go
okey
ffs
why would you turn in a giant java program as a pdf
really
I really would have told him either he standardizes the material turned in or I would have quit
well almost everyone turned in a .java file
two people turned in .dat but I can just rename it to .java
yeah, but you dont have the power to just fail the pdf fucker
but fucking connor sullivan had to go and turn in a pdf
idk
goddamn it conner
maybe
lol
this is why we cant have nice things
I could fail so many of these people for cheating
lol really?
they blatantly copy each other with very little effort to hide it
see, I would be the dick ta that turns them in
well, you see, you and I have copied each other
so I'd feel like a hypocrite if I did that
mehhhh
only a little
and then we stopped
lol
We did it for like all of EE 220
only like 8/14ths
And most of 326
well 326 we worked together
yeah
either way
I dont care
makes it easier to grade
lol
friggin lost it at the pdf thing
lol
tell the professor to let the class know that you will insta-fail anyone who turns it in as a pdf and stare at him with a "you've got to be kidding me" face
XD
lol
well this is the last HW I have to grade
they probably did it as a last homework troll then
nah, he always does a pdf
but...
because he's stupid
whyyyyyyyyyyyy
a few people decided to go above and beyond
and add extra crap to this program
like saving some data to a text file for some reason
I have no clue what the data is
and breaking it in to multiple files and crap
which means it's just harder for me to compile and run
because now I need to install netbeans to import their projects
>_>
instead of just doing javac filename
...
stupid overachievers
FAIL!
dafuq
this guy turned in a zip file
inside of the folder is a file with no extension
and it is just 1000 lines of hex
oh, that was just windows failing to handle a .tar.gz
lol
ohai
hi
hi
sup folks?
grading
gay
o/
i'm not gonna be able to do what i did last night
i can arma but not until 11

sup folks

dreading redoing resume
loool
You guys are all just having a ball today
i just want to finish this stupid grading and be done with it
A's for everyone?
I enjoy giving bad grades to people who turn in trash though
Grade by submission format
.java
A
.dat
C
.pdf
F
.jpeg of a picture of a PDF taken with a cell phone
hand written = fail the course
nobody did that this time
looooool
Hand written
but for the previous 2 programming assignments it happened
they turned in typed code by email, yet they hand wrote it for the physical copy
why
that seems like more work
idk
it is
we even get free printing at the ECC
ooh
which is about 300 feet from the classroom
Hand written in crayon
= expelled
sounds like fun
how many papers do you still have to go through?
like 90%
I can't even figure out how to run this guys code
you delete it
and grade D-
5 people turned in almost exactly the same code
lol
sup dawgs
is brandog finish grading of the yets?
no
why is he no
I'm like 1/3 done
wowch
well
I was gonna ask if you wanted to do another game night

Engrave it with "Katrina"
hallo
hi
hey how do you combine multiple meshes in blender like you did with the boat and all its cannons?
select them all and press ctrl j
that's it?
yes
lol okey
dude in another group was wondering
his group has a giant stadium that's a bunch of meshes, and they had to delete a bunch of the submeshes because it was running out of memory when converting
he thinks combining them will fix it
well that wont reduce the number of vertices
that's what I said
lol
if anything I'd think that would make it worse
because if they are separate it processes each one individually
I think the textures would combine though
or become simpler
i dont think so
it will be one much larger and more complex object then
true
yehidk
lol
how's it goin?
good
finished grading, just gotta put the papers back in his box
very nice
wow, star citizen tutorial is on their dev server
with first person module and stuff I think
game looks fucking beautiful
you know, they have futuristic spaceships
you'd think their radios would be a little clearer than ours are currently
anybody wanna amra?
nobody?
Courtney is doing the amra free trial
there's a free trial?
Free weekend for amra
Andrew will you be my arma guide?
Ian is a meanie
lol
ian is always a meanie

but he snaps at me
but we knew that
and then I get butt hurt
lol
at least let me be your driver
haha everyone gets to be my driver apparently
lolol
callsign airbags, reporting in :P
you know what grinds my gears? when people call me and then leave a 1 second message that doesn't say anything
yeeeep
even worse when they just dont leave a message
i'd much rather have no message
if they leave no message I just assume it wasnt important
very true
ughhh i have to go buy food
make sure you get lots of it
lots of chips
nah, just eat leftovers
but lots of vegies too
i plan on getting lots of chips

i need to get food
i am starving
eat a quesadilla

while I have all the ingredients to make one, i do not want one
lol
let's wait for more peeps, just two people gets pretty tough when you're as bad as I am
lol
xD and im a noob
you don't even own the game

shh shh
just free trial noob
go eat
D:
my linux vm on my laptop does
well
I am in need of a non-locked box so i can download exe-making software
and it requires pyogre installed
you have vmware right?
yeah, but i couldnt get pyogre installed
I can just give you my VM files probably
that might work
it might
making the exe doesnt look that hard
well, it'd be easy if someone had a windows install of pyogre
i want to eat something good, but I dont want to have to wait to cook stuff because I am starving :(

I have a jar of salsa and the lid is REALLY stuck on it
lift the lid slightly with a spoon
I ended up lifting it with a butter knife
*something :P

hello
the trick to opening jars is to use the sharp edge of a bottle opener
that thing is designed to break the vacuum seal
That's why its there

cheesy chili hash brown bake, cheesy bbq sloppy joe, or tacos?
sloppy joe is closest to a hamburger
tacos

Bunch o' money

lemme look
i dont remember what it was called, but Tested had a video about a 3d printer kit you assemble yourself
and i believe it was only a few hundred dollars
Tested featured the Printrbot
what are you gonna print?
I'd like to make a case for my phone with some sort of integrated headphone cable holder
just like 2 small hooks on the side with a little clip to hold the ends secure
hmmm
I wonder what I would print
my headphones are a pain in the butt
they are really nice but they tangle soooo easily
and the ear hook things make them hard to just wrap up
those look nice
they are
I have spent like the past hour contemplating the best way to wrap my headphone cable
I am clearly bored
>_<

Courtney Boyle
good run
lost track of time
I made an avocado pie
y...um?
Yes actually!
Its an amazingly good pie
For some reason if fell out of popularity in the 1960s
but from after WWII until the late 1950s it was hugely popular in the american west and California
..hm
Want the recipe?
You and your girlfriend can try it together!
It takes less than 20 minutes to make
.....nnnah
...maybe
Its creamy and good!
And its easy
And impressive because it sounds weird
but really its just a fruit pie
is brandoge here/alive?
no
no
did you get a hold of your parentals?
they called me
lol

it's going aight
I am bored
hi
Hi
You know, CNN was asking if trains should have seatbelts
hi
lol
you know
8 people died in a train accident yesterday
out of 300
going 105mph
That's pretty good
They probably should but I don't think it'd be practical. Yes indeed.
Actually, because of how trains are build seatbelts would likely lead to more deaths
cause momentum blah blah blah
whiplash and other neck/head injuries
Indeed
Compared to airline wrecks the fatality rate on trains is extremely low
Trains have a pretty good track record.
Most accidents are usually due to human error, can't say that all are
The one in the US this week was 100% human error
105mph on a 50mph curve
Self driving cars have also been in a few accidents lately
Also human error
What mode of transportation isn't prone to accidents
walking?
on a lawn
for 3 metres
carefully
possibly the least prone :P
*steps on hornet
KILL IT
NO ONE LIKES HORNETS
I've done that, maybe it was a wasp or centipede.
lol
How bout them stingless-bees
or mining bees
I like mining bees
Bees are fine, wasps are evil
This is true
Stand filming bees on flowers no problem.
Except africanized bees
those are like wasps
in bee form
Agreed wasp in bees clothing
awesome
Try the Rachmaninoff works
I don't recognize those pieces
darn
They're the most impressive ones on the list
maybe i'm just playing it incorrectly
yup I was
I usually enjoy violin more than piano, it all depends on the piece
violin/cello
They play classical as well as jazz
moonlight sonata sounds more impressive when you play it on an actual keyboard snooty pipe
Well of course it does
lol
xD
You can change pieces
it's pretty much as easy as it is on this as well
Try one of the Rachmaninoff's
but no rhapsody on a theme of Paganini :(
if you try the piano 3rd no 2 start off slow :P
Do prelude 23 no 5
fun
funfunfun
I was like shurg was well
Then I did the Rachmaninoff
I want the sheet music for that one now
That one, in reality
is hard as hell
im sure it is
I haven't been able to read music, I should give it another go
but so is this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt1TrYRAnzQ
got about halfway through it and raged
even though it's my mom's favorite song ever :(
There
PDF
for you
you want movement V of course
Doesn't seem like such a hard piece
Page 20
so many notes in mv III lol
only 2 flats though!
at least its an easy key
lol
the key sig makes 0 difference
seriously
It was a joke
Naturals and flats everywhere
the real problem is my borked thumb so I can barely hit a 9th
woah
short range
for Rachmaninoff at least
almost a 10th on my left hand, not too much of a difference
I can stretch it
but right hand is no way
gimme a week or two of actively trying to learn this piece and i'll be gud
I take it you play a lot then?
used to
it's like riding a bike :)
I am not a very good classical piano player
best quote ever
The Emperor says "you have too many notes"
I love that movie
Emperor Joseph II was not the kindest man ever
lol
His foreign policy was litterally kill anyone who disagrees
lol
i.e. Serbs
The movie portayed him rather kindly though
g'night!
night

Chevy Chase

I should better say it's been uneventful so far
Andrew, do you know when Brandon comes back to Vegas?
The Wizard returns precisely when he intends too?
Wizards, yes.
I'm afraid Wizrods have to run on schedule
ah, an honest mistake
lol
he's heading back tomorrow I believe
amra?

Ian
Courtney Boyle
Ian
Courtney Boyle
yes, tomorrow
dude you're taller than your dad?
i just noticed that
and what is up peeps
sup dawggggg
so tony
would you be interested in drawing up some sprites for a game I'm probably making in unity? (later, not anytime soon i'll just use placeholders until i get mechanics going)
also brandog if you folks want to borrow quelf it is available for the night
yeah
schweet
I'm planning on making a game similar to an old kirby game for the n64
basically you eat enemies, they have an elemental property, and you can combine the abilities for cool new effects
it'd be side scrolling and probably free with ad's at the end of levels or something if I feel like putting them in
and if it made any money i'd give you a cut :P
basically just a summer project that I wanna try out
oh wait like genuine production stuff and not placeholders?
i'll do the placeholders just with like squares and circles and stuff, since i'm doing it in unity
it'd be the final versions of the sprites
and there wouldnt be any time constraint or anything, like I said i'm basically just messing around with unity
final version and sprites I'd charge for work, not cut of profits
yeah i figured
depending on requirements, animation, etc.
i'll see how far I get into making the game first lol
you may actually get a better bang for your buck with dA
dA?
oh, deviantArt, gotcha
yis
yeh, i'll see how far I get lol
realistically it's not hard to program with unity
art is gonna be the factor that makes it marketable probably
but as a first project i'll probably just make it and not put it on the store
or i'll make it free
yeah polish and stuff
with no ads or anything
game market is weird
yeah, I have very little insight on what the market is actually like other than the fact that I enjoy good looking games that dont try to ream me for money in some way
yeah no wallet cornholing
and remember that flappy bird took off for no good reason
brandon and I wanted to make a mobile game but it gets very complicated very fast
i'm watching a flappy bird clone to android tutorial right now lol
lol ahah
hi
hi
I am back from my concert
how was it?
Well its was jazz, played by an orchestra, in a large Art Deco symphony hall
So it was right in the zone of things I like
lol
nice
What has everyone here been up to?
watching unity tutorials and looking at getting a game started
A game?
Tutorials?
yeah i'm gonna try and make a game for android
since i'm taking an embedded games class next semester
ah
i'm currently watching a tutorial on just ezpz 2D unity

thought # 1
#2
I find the flame obstructive of your text and its colour doesn't flow well with your wesites design
I think you should use an electrical arc instead
the blue-purple would look better
AND
it would make your text clearer
I like the flow of the page as you scroll down
Hi
I have arrived
Hi
you are now forever back from Reno?
In celebration of my return, I call for a Ricardo's meeting
Yeah
Here here
how was the drive?
Long
How was Goldfield

We had a uhaul towing my car so we had to go slow

imma set my desktop up tomorrow

Andrew found a server
i heard
lots of $
Its not good for serious play
but heavy machines are so cheap
like too cheap
dig the new camera
i think the fact that it's a relativley old and cheap one surprises people
There are a lot of camera snobs out there
quick before tony disappears!
does tomorrow or wednesday afternoon work for you for Ricardos?
i may not be able to do tomorrow
I have to unload the uhaul into storage tomorrow
I can do either
uh

wednesday more than tomorrow
tuesday more than tomorrow but less than wednesday

I witnessed a conversation today in which "kool-aid" was used to refer to someone's personal business
these youths
ffffuuuucccckkkkdammit
there's two UNR interns at the LV office, and one of them annoys the hell out of me
kill them
gah there's only one at the LV office, the other went to SF
the guy at SF is cool
the guy at vegas is annoying
?
kool aid
you might say I am getting all up in this kids "kool-aid"
i thought kool-aid was like bs
"you drank the kool aid, now sleep it in" or something
from what I have read it has many meanings
but they were talking about people snooping in other's kool-aid and such
cool aid
Courtney: "I'm not electriciting myself"
10/10
would speak English again
oh look

stahp
plox
oh nooo
i read it all
But Brandini ;(
why do I own so much crap
and why must it all go somewhere
lol
you don't have to do it all in one day
Lambrusco
i dont, but I do need to clear my bed before it is bed time
ay yo andrue
is this actually a thing in Reno?
lol, i dont think so
Thought it was a bit excessive lol
sup
yo dawg
I paid my ticket so I don't get an arrest warrent put out for me tomorrow
dangit tony, we can cancel the sting operation we had planned for Ricardos tomorrow
What time for ricardos tomorrow? 6:30?
works 5me
i still want to do the sting operatin
I'll bring the bees then
wtf lenny face
lol
fucking addicting
yeah that was kinda fun
I'm diabetes
lol
what region
ayyy lmao
us west
do you split eventually or what? i don't get it
lol
space to split
teams or ffa
ffa
can you not unsplit after you split?
you have to eat yourself
why the hell did I split into tons of little pieces when I ate a big thingy
got to 902
that thing is a splitter
good for blocking big guys
tony
i am still finding nerf darts from the full auto nerf guns
like 2 years after the battle
or 1 year, whatever
I r bore
we should arma at some point
yeah
lol
wow
been a good while
seems legit
i've seen bacon irl
amra sounds fun after I finish making this bean dip
i can arma in a bit
done making dip
i haz my snax
lets all haz dinner or snackz or whatever then arma
since my snacks moved to vegas :(
stupid vegas
:F
lol
you fools need to mail me some ricardos
will you be home Friday andrew?
should be
okie
porqua
dont question it, just accept it
butbutbut
buttox
o/
\o
Okay
I have eaten
what is everyone's status?
Have we all eaten
also I had mexican
I had mexican twice today
and yesterday
and I probably will tomorrow
tomorrow is wednesday
wednesday is ricardos
so you will probably have mexican tomorrow
also i am reddeh to amra
i also had mexican
also i am cleaning my closet a bit
but feel free to start
NO
JOIN USSSS
Waiting for replys from Tony/Courtney/Thomas too
Though Thomas might be at work
oh
um
ready
can't play long
would like server with action
he is set to "DnD mode"
but yeah
lez do eet
kkkkkk

ricardos is 6:30 tomorrow right?
yes
okie
ohhh Im so sad aboot all the cilantro I don't get to eat.
you can buy some from the store
and eat it when we're at ricardos
to be there in cilantro-flavored spirit
lol ewwww
because I know you love cilantro
and I wouldnt want you to feel left out
lol Ill stick to my spearmint plant and pretend like cilantro doesn't exist ^-^
Dirty Rooskies
lol
hi
Its almost time
for rickys
almost
Brandini do you like hotdogs?
What time are you and Tony leaving?
yes, but not the last bite
i will eat all of a hotdog except the last little bit
i have not heard from tonizzle
i will call him
no answer
he may be driving
oh ok
he just called
we're gonna leave now
kk
I'll leave too
yeah i just called
dat ricardos dough
omg so much jelly today
sugar rush yo
oh boy
o/
yo
hi
lol
hi
so tony, would you be interested in seeing Amaranthe the first week of June?
3/6/15 in LA
I was gonna go with shannon but i realllly doubt she would be fun at a metal concert
lol
I'll pass D:
I do appreciate it but Amaranthe was...well they brought nothing to the table live
lol
i assume they will have a better audio guy this time around
I hope, at least
fingers crossed
i can do some metal but that screamo guy's....alright
luckily he's only there in relatively small quantities
tru
yeh I'll pass
down for LA
Amaranthe left a bad taste in my ears.
live anyways
I liked em other than the pounding bass that literally vibrated everything on earth
i don't recall if they interacted with the crowd much
a ton
their dude literally talked to us for a bit
lol
their performance was actually pretty good, barring the audio problems
their dude
roight
lol
the metal bro
the non-screamo dude
I don't like metal
mr. swedish voice
I don't enjoy metal much
but amaranthe was cool
and I like a few other things
but it's not my favorite
so I tried the battlefront 2 multiplayer
it's kinda dead
four people online
lol
it was still fun though with all the ai
ennehbodeh wanna pley somtin?
im haxing agar.io
too tired :<
arma?>
wait hacking
Ian
Anthony Humphreys
Brandon Worl
not armaing
no one is joing?
just talking
32 != d.keyCode || a || (G(), A(17), a = !0);
Ian
Anthony Humphreys
Brandon Worl
agar, why must you frustrate me
those are the sounds you mike whilst playing it
AG
ARRRR
lol
i tried to hax a bit more today
I verified that almost everything is serverside
i added buttons to zoom in and out and thats about it
can you directly send move commands?
cause i'd be interested in trying some kind of AI
only trajectories to move in
and it only sends entity information for the entities near you
it'd be a micromanagement ai
so that's enough
yeah
instantaneous response is better than "OHSHITMOVETHEMOUSEOHGODWRONGWAY"
lol
I'm not sure how I'd go about making such an AI
well, what info do you get from entities is where i'd start
I can get position and size
But I mean what AI algorithm
what about name
yeah, but that's not really relevant for an AI
it would be if multiple entities with the same owner, near your size, are your target
Well names arent unique
yeah but other than that we don't get ID information I'm guessing
so it'd be a best guess kinda thing
just drop them a bit lower on priority or soemthing
but i'm getting ahead of things
lol
I dont think that's what the AI should be basing its decisions off of though
yeah
basically go for small, avoid large
yeah
but do you want to minimize risk? or maximize payoff?
probably minimize risk
and how do you calculate both of those
well, we'd have to find out the calculation for how far an entity can shoot a half size spawn for a min-risk algorithm probably
yeah
A genetic algorithm would probably be the best bet
if size > mine:
if size + sameNameNearSize > mine:
if mine > size:
teaching it would take a while though
almost definitely
and yeah
state based would work well enough probably
maybe
a genetic algorithm would take splitting into account and play styles and.. well, everything else
you'd have to do near n^2 checks for state based though
genetic seems great, but hard to do
why n^2?
if you're checking for same-name near current target
then it'd be "near" n^2
i still dont think name is necessary or beneficial to use
it might not be
lol
for state base I'd imagine some sort of map would get generated
representing danger
and you'd want to find the min-cost path
then expand upon that by predicting the next time step
seee this is why i need to take AI
so you can do something like figure out how eating a cell in this time step affects the danger levels of the next step
cause I wouldnt think of doing a map
so it'd be a two level map then
which adds complexity
state based seems nice just cause you can do the whole "am i in danger? run. or am i okay? eat the small things on my way around the place"
it could be fun to write a genetic algorithm though
also, for actual pathfinding we'd have to implement some sort of guessing for how the target is going to move next, tricking the little guys into your huge mouth is tough
that would be fun
sushil would probably be interested in it
lol
lol
there are genetic algorithm JS libraries that would make it easier
what would you use as the first few genes though
well I believe you just give it random values
and a score metric
and let it tweak stuff and optimize based on score
with mutations
yeah, initially it should be random, but i'm asking what we're giving it to work on
just "do stuff and improve your score"?
we never covered that in AI :F
lol
genes could be based on a danger map i guess
true
divide the map into cells, assign danger/payout values to cells
all of those are genes
at that point you might be getting a bit slow to work in real time though
maybe
it's a small population of cells though
usually
and easy math to calculate danger/payout
but that's still a macro solution to the problem
in what way?
once you decide to go after a target cell, where do you move towards?
presumably the cell
the cell is faster than you though
so unless he makes a mistake he'll win
that's a detail that the genetic algorithm should just handle, no?
if the guy is too fast it wont get good payout
I don't think so
so the algorithm wont favor it
so it wont go after it
I guess
it'll go after something it is more likely to get
yeah, I didnt think about factoring in the speed/size of the target into the equation
and then in cases where the target cell is very close to ours, it will go after it because those situations tend to payout higher
still though
even stuff that's barely smaller than you can outrun you
it probably would optimize the path better than a human can handle turning though
the genetic.js library is pretty neat
basically just set the functions and it runs/mutates for you
yeah, so a genetic algorithm can be implemented in a nearly entirely generic fashion
you just need to define a heuristic function for the specific application
so you don't really need to decide what genes to use
interesting
idk how that works though
we saw an example of a generic genetic algorithm that was trained to play multiple games
like Breakout
and it only needed a heuristic function
but idk how it gets world state info such as where the ball is in relation to the paddle
position in x,y coords of ball - position in x,y coords of the paddle gives you a vector pointing from one to the other
yes
but if you only define a heuristic function, how does the algorithm know any of that?
well your heuristic function is going to determine what the optimal move is because it keeps the ball going, right?
it just says whether or not a particular genome did well or poorly
the heuristic function
ah
well then it'd be up to the genes
so then the genes must be going based off of pixels or something
basically, you're testing whether or not the move resulted in the ball being kept up or not
but genes are static
after training
so that doesnt make sense
lol
see this is why they have people who specialize in AI lol
i'll look into it some more while i'm attempting to fall asleep :P
I'm trying to find the genetic algorithm we looked at in class
if you check out the genetic.js examples they might give you a better idea of how the pieces fit together as far as the algorithm itself goes
the text matching was cool
those are static problems though
how do you apply that to a dynamic world?
greedy algorithm?
how?
lol
just pick the best option at the current moment and learn from it somehow I guess
I really have no idea
lol
well you dont want to be learning as you go
you want to learn and find the best genome
then run the AI with that genome
and then run with it
yeah
apparently he didnt mention it on Piazza
hrmm
maybe i'll have to ask sushil lol
nor email
I want sushi
anyway
i'mma hop off
lol
night
night
I'm not grasping how you apply a genetic algorithm to something like a multiplayer non-deterministic game
Breakout is deterministic and the same every time you play it
neural nets
noorul nuts
that's how everyone else is doing it for non-deterministic problems
I found a really good resource but it happens to be in french
lol
each one learns individually
the doublezoom link in the comments is the french I was talking about
from what I can gather they go over the things they learn from and how they set it up on the site
i thought I felt something
lol
lol
didnt feel anything here
so yeah
AI for this game using genetic algorithms would require neural nets
and would not be easy to program
so back to that state based idea
yeah i kinda forgot everything I learned about neural nets
i havent learned about them at all
well
that's not entirely true
our last week in 219 with eggbert was just him going over neural nets
so I know how they work
neural nets have nothing to do with computer organization though
lol
but he never went over implementing them
yeah it was a class choice
he was doing a seminar or something for some grad students later that year and wanted to test out his lesson plan
we got to choose learning that or more about caching
and we were all tired of caching
tried playing minecraft with 1gb ram, lagged so hard you couldnt break blocks in single player lol
not sure how they fucked that one up
I just spent like 5 hours playing Happy Wheels
at least 3 of those hours were spent on one level
the fuck
that game is weird
just finished a level with no legs
lol
bruuhhhhhhhh
thanks for the berries!
SO DELICIOUS I CANT STOP EATING THEM
lol
lol
agar on team mode is both fun and frustrating
I have yet to try it
brandog
we need AI to play this game for us
it's too hard
such rage
green is ALWAYS dominating on teams
doesnt matter what server
it's always green
lol
their random team selection probably inadvertantly favors green
but i never get put on green
imma switch servers
i bet anything green will be winning
well well well
green has a massive lead
no suprise there
swapped again, green has lead
oh wow, blue has the lead on this new server
how unusual

hola doctores
hola
how's it goin?
gewd
i might be getting new car sooner than expected
orly
if we can get a good memorial day/50th anniversary deal
nice
if tony did standup comedy
lol
I want to play a lot of games that I do not own
like what?
the witcher for one
also elite dangerous and windward
and darkest dungeon
and invisible, inc.
darkest dungeon looks cool
it is
I've watched like 1000hours of twitch/youtube of it
more like 50 probably
but still
lots
lol
brb in like 20 minutes
Hi
I just drove 4 hours
was meh
hi
sounds meh
It was
I had to drive up to my grandparents
and de-winterize their house
While I was there though I managed to buy 100 rounds or Mauser 8mm ammo though
Where is everyone?
Your mum.
ok
yes
i was at your mum
lol
I am your mum
#thingsyouwishyouknew
well, i spent all day at the various ford dealerships around town
why?
looking for a car
did you find one?
yes
we're negotiating the price
but it got too late and so we'll continue on monday
gotcha
they were like "35k is the best we can do. we'll only make $500 at that price"
so we walked out
lol
and as we drove away they called me and were like "32,500"
and we said we would visit the other dealers
so they said 32
Brandon
we said we'll let them know after we hit more dealerships
scumlords
let me get you a number tomorrow
I know a guy
it's down to 31,500 now
who is this guy and which dealership is he at?
his name is Oan Decowswan, and he is at the dealership of the gods
He's not at a dealership
He buys cars at auction
I got my car
a  in 
for 10k
well, it's a  mustang we're looking at
20,000 miles
lol
oh
If you wanted a  or earlier he could pull it
earlier years of mustangs arent worth looking at
didnt want to go with the scion thingy after all?
well, the price difference isnt huge, and the moosetang is muuuch nicer
gotcha
i test drove it earlier today
vroom
wassap boyz
yo yo daddio
yoyoyo
etho did a world tour :P
yeah
watching it lol
me3
i already know everything in his world i think, but i'll watch it anyways
lol
I know most of it
but some of the recent stuff I missed
it makes me want to play vanilla again
like when we had our snapshot world
I started a vanilla world yesterday
i'm on an island
it's actually kinda cool
there are two underwater temples surrounding me
I built a lighthouse, and it actually looks decent
lol
you should make a server
i could
I've got pretty much all day
just leave it running on my laptop
alex works til 8
imma be leaving in a little bit
pshh
leaving is lame
staying is where it's at
we're gonna go look at the last Ford dealership :F
"oh, yes we can do 12billion dollars!"
"well we've got another dealership for 31000"
"Did I say 12billion, I meant 12!"
lol
there are two that I'm considering
one is a dark dark green/grey color
and is cheaper
the other is white with black stripes and has better speakers
why is it cheaper though?
ah
and premium leather
yeah
get that one
and backup sensors and stuff
leather and speakers are 100% the reason I miss my old car
well, both are leather
You planning a heist?
vgh :P
lol hai
just one is black/red and the other is black
black is nice
the black/red does look slick though
black/red would probably be cooler on hot days as well
just a tiny bit
the white exterior would help
yep
both have heated/cooled seats and steering wheel
cooled seats huh? that's new
I don't think my mom's  acura TLX even has cooled seats
and they got every package available on that thing
fucking ridiculous :P
lol
that's the more expensive one
sometimes I think my dad gets paid off by some form of mafia/mob because I have no idea how they pay for that stuff as well as my college :P
jesus yes
lol
yesyesyesyes
that one
#gonnacrashitsohard
the price difference may not be justifiable though
wha'ts the difference?
they wouldnt come down as low as the other one
well, the white one has about $ worth of additions over the "Guard" colored one
we can get the guard one for $31500
the white one was like $36000
gotcha
hrmm
i dont care really about blind spot/reverse sensors
I feel like the extra 4500 is worth the looks, leather, and speakers though
yeah
but the asthetics
form over function
it also has memory foam seats
O.o
wow
the white one
yes
plz
lol
i didnt notice a difference honestly
from the foam
you would if you drove it from vegas to reno
the black/white does look slick though
for a nightwish concert
lol
thats what the other one looks like
mmmmehhh
it's nice
I could always add a stripe later
seems like a james bond kinda car
and better speakers
That's a nice car
that's true
but
memory foam seats
lol
lol
when you unlock the car, it projects ponies on the ground by the doors
what speakers does it have? like, brand/type/size
lool
Shaker audio or something
i dont remember
well
the sub does make a noticable difference
if it comes with a subwoofer setup
yeah
thats totally worth it
getting subs put in AFTER is a fucking pain
I could add a sub myself though for much cheaper
eh
we can do it ourselves easily enough
I think you underestimate how difficult it is
but the factory one fits perfectly into the side cubby in the trunk
although
your brother does that stuff
so
my brother has added subs to his car
lol
yeah
multiple times
I helped my buddy do speakers and subs in his car and it was horrible
we did speakers for the Corolla, but no sub
we had to completely remove the seats, and do a bunch of metal cutting to put the subs in, then we had to weld shit back together after
granted, his car was an old chevy caprice
so
lol
I'm sure the mustang has aftermarket stuff that will fit the same as the factory stuff
so installation should be easy
probably
that color though
white is so nice
:F
lol
it doesnt show rain spots
like, at all
nextgentech
so
that mc server :P
lol
we're leaving in a sec
i can host your map if you want though
when i get back
or we can do a new map
whatever floats your boat
anywho, afk
I'll look at my map to see if the surrounding areas have any cool biomes or something
so for when you get back, all of the cool biomes are within 5000/5000, mesa and ice spikes included, the island is actually in a pretty cool location, and it's an amplified map so it looks cool
yo yo yo errbuddy
generikB here!
Hello
greetings
hilo
Hi
supdoges
soup bowls
i decided to get the Guard colored mustang
instead of the white one
guard?
but dealerships arent open on sundays
so i must wait
yeah
What is that
it's like a grey/green
Should have gone with black or blue
I'll likely add two white strips going down the middle of it at some point
i dont like black or blue
black shows dirt too easily and it hides a lot of the finer angles/shapes of the car
and my corolla was blue
how are you pay for this car
job
Are you going to pay off car then move out?
cs entry level is fairly lucrative
i'm not sure when imma move out
probably no more than a year though
Yeah
you'll want to pay down the car first
lol
I could rent one of my parents rental houses
and my rent would be pretty low
Do your parents have a rental on the south side?
he's just saying if you try to get a credit check for a house/apartment, they'll frown upon the fact taht you still have a car out
the car payment is around 400/month i believe
no
no?
their rentals are nearish to their house
one is being rented by my brother and is like 3 minutes away
I'm not sure exactly where the other is
down the street from ricardos hopefully
lol
kinda a shitty neighborhood to live in
^
Kinda?
more like really
lol
hey, ricardos makes it worth
no
brb 1 sec
no no no no no
getting shot is less important than being near ricardos
by far
back
hi
hi
ji
jejejeje
kkkkkkkkkkk
hon hon hon hon hon hon
i could always have my parents cosign for house/apartment
cosign looks so weird
i want to write cosine
lol
yeah
de-cosine
decosign
what is the oposite of cosine?
lol
arccos
deco's arch nemesis must be arccoson
lol
So, sup folks?
just chillin
le same
played some vanilla mc for a bit
was fun
ehh
I'm so burned out on vanilla mc
when's the last time you played?
well I tried 1.8 a couple weeks ago
it's pretty cool
I like it anyway
don't feel like its very deep really
I don't like old fashioned mining
and not having pipes
I don't mind it at all
I really like mc with machines
Yeah i enjoy them as well
but there's just something different about playing modded
different feel to it
I feel more focused on making more and bigger and better machines rather than building things
I love building
if I have world edit
lol
just vanilla building is fun
It's hard
which is why it's fun
no skyscrapers though :(
skyscrapers are ezpz
not full size ones
with nice materials
just fill your inventory with cobble
I do wish vanilla had auto-replacing for stacks of building materials and weapons/tools if they break or run out
that'd make building less tedious
plus dyed class is a pain
also inventory size upgrades would be nice
dyed glass is a pain to craft, yes
but it looks so nice
you know what else looks really nice?
so how am I to easily build a top notch skyscraper
the witcher 3
what are you building it out of?
and what's your problem with building skyscrapers in the first place?
Nao had his hotel on the snapshot server and that was basically a skyscraper
I mean like sea level to the top of the map
right
and wide enough to to look weird
made of diorite, sandstone, and quartz
well
possiblely that new ocean block
mining the diorite, sandstone, and quartz would take time
but crowd-sourced it'd be doable
we've done plenty of that kind of resource gathering for docs bases before
It wouldn't be an issue if I had miners
lol
yeah, just enlist hippos and herp to mine
and then you just build it
ezpz
What about prismarine
and the sea lanturns?
prismarine and sea lanterns are a pain to get
just in general
so gl;hf
lol
but that colour
it does look nice
imagine
a building
made of that
diorite
and quartz
me gusta
and white stained glass
mmmmm
so lets start a server and build it!
We'd have to build a fish farm
which I started on a server
and then gave up
lol
etho has one
gives like two doublechests of items in 10 hours of afk
Its a pain because of laser beam fish
the guardians?
yes
or the elder guardians
which are you trying to farm
lol
the elder ones mostly
not farm them
the elders don't respawn
but the regular fish
its a pain to work underwater
so just kill them and it's gg
the other fish still laserbeam you
there's the respiration and water-walking thingies
well yeah
I think splash potions work well
I forget if they fly correctly in water or not
we need subs
mmmehhhh
plus where are we geting a server
they need underwater horses
nao's laptop
lol
bukkit is ded though
aint no need fo bukkit
it'd be fun to do a modded server that doesn't have OP mods
I agree
Can it be 1.6.4
like TE, AE2, IC2, and MFR
nobody likes 1.6.4
trains
1.8 is the way to go
can we do 1.7?
using buildcraft as a main mod again would be fun
and have rails of war
BC 7 is supposedly good too
like, it wont kill the server
can we haz rails of war
and that one realistic electric mod pack
mod
not pack
Electrical Age?
yes
it doesnt get updates it seems
Can we do like  1910 minecraft
but i guess we could
we're not doing 1.7.4?
lol
1.7.10
close enough
lol
we'd have to make recipes or ways to buy the rails of war parts
but they are so cool
we NEED them
EA just bothers me since it ticks way slower than any other mod
like 20 nano seconds per cycle instead of 2-4
AE2 with a large complex network does like 5 nano seconds, meanwhile EA with almost no placed blocks still takes 20+
seems like it needs a rewrite
it is being rewritten
I cheated
or do you mean EA?
EA
oh
i have no clue what the development status is on that
it just never seems to have updates
lol
so RoW, EA, BC7
minetweaker for RoW recipes probably
^
We should do it
1912craft
it would be fun
and we should build
focus on building
build a town centered around railways and stuff
we could add carpenter's blocks for building purposes
and chisel 2
Realistic World Generation instead of BoP
because RWG looks beautiful
lets do eeeet
just for fun
and pretty
we could make a great display map
and the Rails of War trains look amazing
so thats 7 mods
any others?
i'd like to keep it very low on mod count
railcraft
just for ease of updating/distributing
railcraft
for recipes/steel
whats the current list
BC7, RoW, RC, MineTweaker, RWG, Chisel 2, Carpenter's, EA
maybe JABBA too
I want to say MFR
but
ehhh
MFR is so OP
jabba is good
I know
1 block tree farm
lol
oh
tinkers
we can use BC robots for stuff
construct
we could have tinkers
BC has robots?
it would fit the theme
it does
they are new
okay
so with tinkers we should be good
nice actually small pack
lol
and none of that reika crap
lol
pushing new updates with annoying messages every other day
I could assemble a pack pretty quickly
we could add decocraft
since it would fit the era
if we're going for buildy stuff
oh yeah
they recently released decocraft 2
good plan
this sounds nice
11 mods
nice and small
gonna go eat then I'll put it together
it should be pretty
kk
ALOHASNACKBAR
lol the tab name "you're now on a list"
hi
i ate and cleaned my car a bit
well, i assembled the mods and it all ran first try
lemme get the client put together now
coo coo
I'll be able to play most of tomorrow
so that should be fun
i forgot how to test the client
lol
hi
hi
I just had dinner
what did you have?
chicken pizza
only one slice though
so, why 1912 Craft?
is 1912 significant?
dunno
It was the end of an era kinda
everything sorta spiralled out of control after that point
lol
We could do 1920s craft
too late
it's already 1912
lol okay
doesn't matter
we need recipes for the RoW stuff
dafuq
it wont download
Issue with your host or the launcher?
it's using the wrong dropbox link
and it wont update to the correct one
wut
I had to change the end part to "?dl=1"
but it keeps trying with =0
waddafak
can you open the Technic launcher and search for "1912Craft"
and let me know if it downloads correctly
loading
one sec
its downloading 1912craft-1.0
it says the pack is corrupt for me now
what did you do
it's downloading currently
it wont even show up in my launcher now
I think you need to reinstall technic or something
it's launching for me
mine is launching
mine's up
no crashes or anything
mine is running
now it's downloading
mine works
mine also works
imma make sure RWG is working though
it looked like it was
having no jetpack will be weird
or giant inventory bags
i guess I need to add NEI
lol
it will be fun
tinkers has things for that
nei is needed
lol
also we need to make those recipes
this seed is crap
flat and snowy
mesa biomes look amazing with RWG
what version is it?
we need plains for our town
is what?
k added NEI and InvTweaks
man this reuploads to dropbox soooo much faster than the other pack
fjaskjlkasgf
nei has some sort of dependancy i am missing
oh fun
fun
fun
goddammit
code chicken core is being stupid
chknbns
hiw downloads on his website are outdated
and not labeled as such
.........
10/10
would do a good job
did you get it fixed?
i think so
testing right now
kkk
ffs
still broken
yyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
it's just the technic launcher being retarded i think
give it some brain food
i think it is fixed now
ok
is work now
shall i toss it up on my laptop?
sure
we still need recipes
for RoW
yes
idk how to work Minetweaker
and idk RoW
I know RoW
but not minetweaker
that it?
not sure
we could use that
maybe
but fancy gui
looks like a pain to do manually
yeah lol
my laptop is on wifi
idk how well it will work for hosting
plug it in?
then it would be soooo far from my desktop
ehhh
so?
lol
im not sure if there are actually any ethernet ports open for me to use
buy a switch?
lololol
we'll see how wifi fares
how we gonna do them recipes
68.224.241.115
i'll add the gui thing
kk
I could also just host it off of my desktop
it wouldnt be up 24/7
but it would be less laggy
well we could try the laptop
to start with

this pack is very different
I like how i'm now known as huros, instead of Ment :p

fine fine fine i'll add waila
openblock's art is too ugly to include
radios
jukeboxes

no internet radio there
records are more 1912's than radios are
Actaully more people could afford a radio
and records were cylinders at that time
alternate universe
y u hat radios
i dont
i hat crayons and junk
lets remove their recipes then
oh
radios were removed in 1.7.10

I'm making a workshop right now
or about to start making it, at least
also
worth adding?
storage drawers absolutley
for my kitchen
yessir
lol
Brandini
the backpack mod looks cool too
hi
hi
hi
what happened to no more mods
lol
well
guys guys
i felt like we were lacking some things
sleeping bags (which backpacks adds) and mobile crafting (also adds)
how about a universal way to transmit any kind of power
and a nice looking storage option
Meguel and I have never be on at the same times
Huros doesn't love you
Why Huros?
Wiiiiy?
wiiiy?

The Netherlands and Canadians have to compete for the title of most peaceful people
...but...competing isn't very peaceful at all
Well looks like we have a crusade on our hands
Guess it's the canadians... damnit
no no, itmust not be
The Netherlands are truly the most peaceful, and we accept our second place with gratitude
We insist :p
I am too humbled to accept.
We're sorry
卍
No, we're sorry.
I will accept the honor if neither candidate can accept it
on behalf of America
xD
lol
I 2nd that
for FREEDOM™ of course
Our Canadian Geece accept the most peaceful award with greed.
Thank you.
Have a good night sirs.
Brandon
we have to pollute more
to finish off those geese
once and for all
Although the backpack is way too OP, if you want to balance the OP-ness of the backpack, Minimize the storage space for liquid.
lol
No you! have a good night
dem packs OP breh
i didnt look at the numbers, what is op about them?
apparently liquid storage
Those drawers look nice
I was just looking at comments
I too like the drawers
does it store like a barrel per tank? lol
Guys, we need a token
And drawers.
dunno lol you'd have to try I guess? :P

My labtop just turned itself off
without permission
like it thinks its a big shot or somethin
lol
i may remove the backpack mod actually
i dont like how it lets you access them without wearing them
whai
ah
that lets you just have a ton of storage on you
and the backpacks dont burn in lava
I wouldnt mind that part :(
lol

Hello
hi
find any mods?
no
nothing just adds more fuel sources or non-OP power generators that I can find
there's a mod that adds buildcraft water wheels and windmills, but it doesnt work with BC 7
how about forestry?
and plugins for forestry
That should do it
I wish forestry looked nicer
it doesn't look any worse than buildcraft
buildcraft looks nicer in BC7
plugins for forestry is still outdated
dang
forestry could still mean more fuel types
unless we want to make our own fuel mod
lol
well, having more fuel types is good, but the auto farms are more OP than I would like
I do like that fuel is a challenge currently
making our own fuel mod would be fun though lol
problem is that there is no option for liquid fuel
a fuel mod would be cool
we could make a multiblock structure for coal/charcoal liqufaction
we'd have to design it to work with BC 7 though
and maybe some way of turning plant mass into fuel
also some way to make batteries and battery operated motors would be cool
^
and a some type of electric engine
of course, we could always power our town with electrical age
EA doesn't have a way to output RF does it?
it does
is it effective?
it's expensive to generate enough power for significant RF
though a fuel mod would still be cool
but my method was very brute force when testing
yes
a fuel mod would take time though
fuel types in any mod pack seem to be lacking
yeah
at least like a week to get something usable probably
and there would be art to do
Making it be a BC7 addon would save some time
probably
since we could piggyback off of the BC refinery and stuff
I thought that would be the plan anyway
yeah
that would still take a fair amount of time
well, we could use a combination of RC/EA power for our town while we plan/develop this fuel mod
to do it right
That is also an option
i think EA could make enough power with a smarter system
using batteries as capacitors
We should try that
but we still need a boiler
for basic power
and steam is easy to transfer
with no loss of power
keeping a boiler hot requires a ton of fuel though doesnt it?
we're not going to have a full size one to start with
just a small one
to run quarries and other basic machines
once we get the coke plant up it won't be a problem
the coal coke plant has 20 things now
coke ovens?
already?
yeah
lol
well then
bug guy came to spray and woke me up at like 10 am
so I have had lots of time to build stuff
lol
I see
what else did you build?
i moved crafting supplies to the workshop
made a ton of each BC pipe
oh good
19 stacks of coal coke
mining
and my axe
you must have been bored
lol
made the smeltery look a bit nicer
did you get some more clay?
imma go afk for a little bit then perhaps we can work on power and plan out this fuel mod
uhh
theres like 600 clay in the workshop
oh kk
yeah
k, afk

hello
ugh my lightbulb just died
brb
okay
so
shall we work on the power plant?
perhaps
judging by the spam of messages on my console saying you moved too quickly, i am guessing you saw our slime bound pad experiment
yes
much better than any boring old elevator
openblocks
elevators
are better
nah
slime elevator is cooler
you can't go down
drop in to water
that's lame
or a piston contraption that moves the pads
hopping on

btw this mod is super pretty if you want to add it
just can't publish reddit stuff about it apparently
but good looking tech mod
around the time period we're working around from what ive seen of it as well
is there any video/pictures of it?
direwolf, but yeah
that one and the previous episode
I like the wiring and the steel scaffolds
looks like a nice mod
and the ore doubler looks good
and conveyor belts :D
psst
deco
does that wood look ok?
it is dark oak
i think something darker might be better
I say darker
needs moar dark
yes
also courtneys opinion is potatos
i did it in spruce and it looks ugly
so now I am experimenting
brown stained clay?
but that is so textureless
also unless there is brown stained clay growing on mountains all around us I dont want to make it

Gentlemen, scramble the aircraft: http://giant.gfycat.com/FearfulRigidGrebe.webm
oh god
I've seen something like that happen in arma
lol
5 helicopters and a jet in a collision
so much money lost
it was altis life too
they were running drugs
and the jet collided with a helicopter taking off
ohhh no
which fell on 4 other cargo choppers
wat
when did my computer go to sleep o_O
dunno
around 11:30 apparently
do wizrod computers dream of electric sheep?
yes
did you see the bridge?
i got a traffic citation on my way home :(
i did
Henderson or Vegas
and for what
paradice
I live in Paradise
running a red light on a left turn (I swear it was green)
see
thing is
the guy ahead of me just straight stopped when he was the cop
while he was still mid-turn
so I may have been in the intersection during red, but I entered it on green
er
when he saw the cop*
Are you gonna fight the county?
yeah
also what were the cross streets?
it was right outside the hard rock parking garage
i dont remember the street names
sec
ah
Paradise and harmon?
paradise and harmon
yes
notorious intersection
lol
the cop got all mad at me for turning in to a parking lot
Whats the ball?
?
ball
amount owed
i'm not sure
i didnt see any amount on the citation
it says on your ticket?
you were just warned then?
his handwriting was terrible
no
i'll go look more closely
lol
i couldnt read it in the car
ok
I am either blind or there is no amount anywhere on this
whatttt
What is on there?
oh god his writing is aweful
it is
I can't even read your middle name
whatever it is
Gen
lol
okay you're las vegas justice
i do not see any dollar amount on here
so the ticket is las vegas not county
"u-turn on steady red"
sure
sure you did
it was green!
GREEN!
I'm reading the ticket
nothing on the back?
nope
one sec I may be able to get you to see your fine
Thats for citations
hmm
They might be forcing you to go to court
whats your plan?
nevermind
try to get it reduced as much as possible
court is not manatory
Do you know a lawyer?
he said I have to go to court by aug 8
you can also plead online and pay the whole ball
my brother went to some dude who got his tickets reduced to parking violations
well, I want to get it reduced so that it will hopefully affect my insurance less
lol
well ask your brother, and if he can't find you a guy I know a lot of lawyers in town who may know someone
mine didn't affect my insurance at all
infact, since I turned 23 my insurance went down this month
lol
well, a 2 door sports car + ticket = high insurance costs
lol
officer D. Korman?
that's what it looks like
let me seee
i think he was yelling at me to roll my window down, and I didnt hear him
my left ear hears nothing but ringing right now
lol
teninitus party
see
that is my right ear
my left ear never hears the crackle sound
my right ear is never affected by concerts
it is perfectly fine right now
wutttt
yet it is the one that gets crackling noises
how old did he look
30's
37ish?
possibly
i never got a good look at his partner
just saw him in my mirror from behind
older guy with greying hair
He lives on Jones
lol
lol
you would think they would put the ball on the ticket
you would
you probably have to call them
they don't have a self serve
for some reason
on their website
"Pay the full amount shown on your ticket/citation in accordance with the Violation Code found on the front of the ticket/citation."
i cant read the code
C501 maybe
He made $50,883 last year
and recieved a bonus of $1710
and he recieved $26,326 in "additional benefits"
wat
that's a lot of money
also I was wrong
He live on the west side

LAS VEGAS NV 89149-1504
your detective skills are creepy
what
the fact that you can determine all of this
lol
He's registered Republican
and has made local campaign monitary contributions
supposedly there should be a violation code on the back of the ticket
which is how you know the amount
but i dont see it
one sec I'm asking the city for your public record
I will find zis
you're not in the system yet
can I see the back of the ticket?
yes, sec
wow
nothing
well
see if it comes up tomorrow
let me give you a link
use that
ok, i'll check it tomorrow
I wish I just had a dash cam >_>
I swear the light was green when I entered the intersection
Speed Cited
   40
Speed Limit
   25
Location
   GREENWAY RD/HORIZON DR
That was me
lol
However
is that your only violation?
Yes
AP AMENDED TO IMPROPER PARKING (MISDEMEANOR)
Thats what it is now
and your insurance didnt go up at all?
nope
ah
That doesn't get reported
yeah, we're gonna try to get it changed to a parking violation too
good plan
lol
lol
probably lol
lets do it
i finished the windows on the powerplant foor
holy hell
roof*
lol
...
oh
Let me come look
i also finally put a roof on the fuel refining building
bout time
Brandini on mc?
i'm testing stuff on single player
gonna go back to the server in a few minutes
kk
hi
hi
did you find out your fine?
the status on my package STILL has not updated
where the hell is it?
that is my question
nope, no clue
no clue on your fine?
yes
hmm
did you check that link?
i did
hmmm
maybe the court hasn't received it still
maybe he lost it
lol
its bar coded
so I doubt that
maybe it glitched
maybe my name causes the system to crash
so he scanned it and it all died
like that Apple text message bug
anyways
i mined a ton of iron and coal
and finished the power plant roof
and stuff
woo
we should make a huge steel tank for creosote
all of our ovens are full in the fuel processing building
thats what I wanted the iron for
lol

the work
it really piled on today
feel like im digging through a mountain
made out of paper
with paper snow
so it never gets smaller
flame throwers are effective against paper
good thinking
hallo
hai
hi
i realized that it only takes 1 ender pearl to make an entire stack of autarchtic gates lol
but I did find the end portal anyways
lol
I'm making the diamond chipsets for the robots now
once those finish in a few hours I can make the redstone core thingy and then make the programs and then we might finally be able to make a tree farm
burn teh paper
all of it
who would vote for such a dummy
not me
I saw that

hi
so who's excited for fallout 4?
meh
never played any of them
lol
Can't get excited for anything I can't run :P
lol
true
I loved both 3 and new vegas
so i'm super excited
seriously some of the best rpg/shooters ever
my laser/assembly table has been running for hours
i started it yesterday
and it is only at 20%
wow
20% done making 1
out of 8
i made 1 redstone crystal
finally
7 more to go
this would take me 10 ticks per crystal on my NaoPack base
4 seconds to make all 8
I feel like our power issue would be trivial to solve with Electrical Age and a degree in electrical engineering
lol if we were EE majors EA would be OP
no more battery = explode
well, i think i know how to make batteries work now
but I just dont understand how to get power out of a windmill correctly
nor why this 43 arrangement of solar panels seems to be really good
4x3*
lol
I boosted the EA config a bit on my test world
so that it converts to RF at 4x the original ratio
which is what I saw some other modpacks doing
seems like a good idea
why does adding 3 more solar panels have no effect?!?! why is electricity so hard
lol
well, I can get like 200 rf/t
only problem is the wires are super hot
and I imagine that is bad
151 *C
oh
it blew up
that sounds about right lol
you probably need to parallelize things to get more rf
well, it is parallel
i mean run them all on separate wires
problem is, the wires are rated for 20A
i am pushing 40A
yeah
gotta split dat
and 1.36 KW
and it can only handle 1 KW
if I make it only use one 4x3 array it lowers to 19.8 A and 341 W
... and 17.2 V
just do a couple of those then?
which is still making over 100 rf/t
I'll try making 3
and see if it explodes for no reason
lol
3 of them is getting around 390 rf/t
nope, making more than that even
500ish
well, that's a good bit of power, but making 36 solar panels isnt easy
not bad though
just make 360 of them and it'll be 5000
and then cross a wire on accident and blow it all up
that sounds dangerous
Hi
hi
Also I am thrilled for Fallout 4
yay
boston should be interesting
especially since i know basically nothing about boston lol
I hope it is
makes me want to play through 3 and NV again
I've put so much time into those
and Elder Scrolls
skyrim and morrowind are the only two of those i've played through
Same
oblivion master race
well
oblivion and skyrim
not morrowind
morrowind was awesome
you actually played it? more than just the marshmarro?
haha yeah, i got like a third of the way through
died a lot and forgot to save though so i never finished
Andrew
Brandon and I did fantastically well at arma last night
I wasn't even killed by a human
I did step on a mine though
my point is
hahaha
you missed out
god Jack Frags' Ark Survival videos are hilarious
wat
Ark Survival is what?
it's some early access dinosaur survival game
oh
muwahahahaha
i am making the 3 robots needed for the tree farm
hoorah!
zoohah!
blah
poobah
anyone here?
yes
want to play arma?
perhaps with andross?
im trying to figure out these robots
oh?

thats why i linked it
i said "you can just tell he is russian"

my robots work :D
nice
they are farming trees
ever find out why that one disappeared?
with an unbreakable lumber axe
I have no clue
yeah how did you get that X rating?
obsidian head, paper everything else
that got me reinforced 3 and 6 modifiers
added 1 more modifier for 7
7 obsidian plates on top of the 3 from the obsidian head = reinforced 10
wow
didnt know that's how adding obs plates worked
kinda cool
once you have that the tooltip literally says "unbreakable"
nice
this tree farm is really effective
OH YEAH!?!? I'LL SHOW YOU EFFECTIVE!!!
there you go
mhmm

is the andrew still here?

now THAT is realistic terrain generation

sup
yo
yo mayn wassap holmes, wanna go get some churros or sumting cause i'm feelin sweet and spicy you kno holmes?
no
i dont know
why must these design assignments be so long
so many comments
and we're on easy programs
:F
lol
I'm going to dread the day they have to write functions
it's taking me like 10mins a student on decent submissions now, it'll probably take like 30 for all the function comments
especially since I keep telling them "attention to detail matters", so I have to pay attention to detail
as time goes on the quality of your grading will drop, thus making it take less time
^'
my thoughts exactly
lol
lol
"well, he has comments.. and the comments seem to contain some of the correct words.... 10/10!"
lol
i'm attempting to be strict for now so that in the future the fuckers will get it right the first time and I don't have to grade them at all
u wot
I can just copy paste my "full_credit_rubric.txt" into the comment box and hit go
u want might
I had a peanut butter and banana wrap for lunch
it was good
the ones from that place?
with honey and stuff
nah, homemade
oh
lol yeah i felt good about eating something minorly healthy
and it was basically free
since I didnt pay for the bananas, or the peanut butter, and the tortilla was worth like 4 cents
anyone want to amra?
i am trying to figure out how to auto manage the tree farm and pipe the wood to the oven
the coke ovens?
no, the steam oven
why not the coke ovens?
its more fuel efficient
because that wont make enough charcoal or creosote to power either boiler
It will if they all run constantly
no it wont
are you sure?
yes
how do you know?
it takes 6 minutes to make 1 bucket of creosote with logs
that means we're making 20 buckets per 6 minutes
the boiler consumes it much faster than that
it also eats charcoal super fast
what if they fed both the oven and the coke ovens?
we could also make more coke ovens
then it wont have enough charcoal
more robots
we can't fit more coke ovens in the building
the answer is always more
we can put them underground
ooorrrr we could just feed it to the steam oven
then the liquid boiler won't run
do we need it to run?
it increases our output a lot
well, first of all, we're not even using the steam at all currently
but our power needs are very low
a full size solid boiler can produce over 1k rf/t
which is way beyond our needs
but wat if I want to use builders and architect tables
still well within our power limits
and that is a burst consumption
not constant
meaning if we store steam we can easily handle that
we still need moar fuel and pipe options
lol
we really don't
moar options
moar
is always the answer
I added Thermal Dynamics to the pack
o.o that's like hax in 1912 though
we already have BC pipes
not that different
oh nvm
read it as thermal expansion
not dynamics
how are all those reciped to be done without a pulveriser?
Did everyone die?
they have alternate recipes
even for like electrum and shiny metal etc?
probably uses gold or diamonds instead
most of the mods have alt recipes for only being used vanilla
it adds invar ore
er, ferrous
so you can make invar
electrum is just an alloy
so you can still make it
you need the smelter for everything then?
the tinkers one
lol
or crush it to dust
with electrical age
ah
lol
that was so slow yesterday
it was
lol
better to just melt it
i tried redoing the boilers a bit
the fluid pipes were like flowing the wrong way and being retarded
so i rage quit and just install TD

wow and it has giant turtles with spiky shells
punching people so hard they turn into a backpack: priceless
lol
jack frag's videos are hilarious
he gets shat on by a giant dino
HEY spoilers!
i'm on vid 2
nah man that isnt a big spoiler
just started it lol
video 2 is the best
they are pretty hilarious
that freaking guy
you will know who I mean
that guy
lol
anyways brb
i feel like playing arma
I agree
so does andrew
and Tony?
o/
yus
no WAY
can't, got laundry to do and then I have to go get alex from work
dont do it
play arma instead
always teh excuses
tell alex that you decided to let her hang out with her friends after work
lemme grab a bowl of food
then i'll be ready
ok
i is red e
also i think i found a way to turn charcoal into coal
but it is SLOOOOWWWWW
how?
i got bored and stopped testing to make sure it works because it took so long
you can use electrical age to turn charcoal into coal powder
which you can then smelt in a smeltery for liquifacted coal
and presumably pour for a coal block
i didnt test that last bit
oh lol
because melting coal powder takes forever
200v
supah powah
no, the smeltery is the slow part
oh
lol
a 50v macerator woild keep up with the smeltery no problem
it is THAT slow
how come
dunno
so
are we arma now?
are we?

Dave lost his kill count stats
waaaaat
how do you know?
he didnt log in for over 30 days
forums
lol
poor dave
i just got a warning on the MC server console
"Warn: Time ran backwards!"
magic
poor dave
that means he doesnt have 10x your kills anymore nao
or whatever measurement we were adding to your killcount that was still below dave's
i'm not sure how hard it would be to change the rendering of things for a player (like night vision) but thermal vision would be awesome for a helmet modifier
well, MC has basic shader support
so probably just a matter of adding a shader
Hello
yelloh
hi
been playing dirty bomb for the last couple hours
pretty fun
how much is it?
i saw pause streaming it last night
it's free
oh wow
yeah
it looks good for a free game
it's like a darker, better looking tf2
I thought he was streaming CoD lol
i'll be back home around 5, we should play then
until he said the name of the game
yeah it's really fast
not as many selections for guns as cod, it's more like tf2/LoL in that it has classes/heroes with specific abilities, and the things you unlock (from cases like bf4) augment your abilities in a customizable fashion
lol
Its pretty warm today
anyone here?

I found on SP that 4x3 arrays of solar panels work well
i kinda feel like arma

MX SW is correct
this stupid hand of spider solitaire is impossible
I have been trying to beat it for 49 minutes and 18 seconds
lol
it isnt even a hard one
it is one suit
hi
HELLO
GREETINGS
YOU ARE LUCKY VISITOR NUMBER 4859!
WHAT DO I WIN MYSTERIOUS BANNER/AD ON TOP OF 90's WEBPAGE!??!?!
A TRIP TO AUSCHWITZ!
WOOOOO
so
so
dirteh bomb
what's the plan
kaboomz
I put in a meatloaf
what did you put in the meatloaf?
I thoroughly enjoy meatloaf
breadcrumbs
how thoroughly? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
and seasoning
( ‾ʖ̫‾)
lol
oh and an egg
( ͡~ ͜ʖ ͡°)
( ͠° ͟ʖ ͡°)
my grandma makes meatloaf with oats
it's really good
I was going to used saltine crackers

aside from meatloaf
but if you toast toast, is it still toast?
or is it double toast
it is 2toast
which is 2toast4some people
so
3toast5me

imma play some dirty bawmb in a bit
like 15mins probably
I'll amra after dinner

but I almost have this one beat
lol
after an hour and a half
yessss
an hour and 25 minutes and 56 seconds
but I beat it

welp
i set my alarm
for work
ARE YOU READY?????
in the AM hours
Ready for the REAL WORLD
yeah i suppose
it aint so bad
lol
work is just boring
at least for me
and my boring job
free food at least once a week, interesting projects, fun people
foos ball
99% of the work enviroment are the people there
yes
I work with boring people
two of the people who I found annoying are either gone or in different offices now
which is nice
3 interns this summer too
tbh out of all the offices the Vegas one is probably the most boring
san francisco built a box fort
and worked from within their fort
for a few days
such envy
i feel like the SF office exists entirely to do quirky things that end up on the Originate facebook/news letters
that's because they live in a very "happy" environment
their inspiration comes every day in the form of random naked people walking across the street
you might even say
it was
"gay"
what's up with SF and naked people on the streets
it's not illegal there
it's also not illegal on like a three block radius in the middle of sacramento because of a zoning quirk
lol
they're trying to create the law that fixes it now
off ta bed, g'night chaps
night
oh real quack
your mod should add a banana for scale
lol
like a ruler item?
a block that is the size of a banana
but it works like landmarks
so you can connect four in a configuration
and it'll give you the size of the box
or the size of a line if they are just two connected
you'd have to fiddle with the mechanics
sounds easier to make is more like the MFR ruler
but I thought it'd be cool/funny
just right click to set point A and B
and it tells you the dimensions
yeah but I think a real world object would be better
some kind of visual representation
otherwise it feels a bit hacky
but theres no reason for it to be a block
from a functional pov
right
if it was an item you could eat it too
it's totally an asthetic
true
that'd be funny
anyway
night
night
I am tempted to try Arma with an Occulus Rift
It works well with TrackIR
it is supposedly totally usable with the Occulus too
Arma updated today
first thing on the changelog
Fixed: Rabbit infestation on both islands
Fixed: Gorgon APC can no longer drive on the seabed and floats instead
boo
boo
Added: New audio samples for Explosive charge and Claymore
new sounds for the will of allah though
woo
no navid nerf
4 updates in since the DLC
I assume navid will be OP 5evur
y u no use navid?
lol
after yesterday I have determined the MX SW is trash
it shoots peas
yup
That's why I was like
y u like it so much
because it worked well that one day
Its got low recoil
but you need to fire 5-10 centre mass shots to put armoured targets down
but yesterday twice i unloaded like 15+ bullets into people from < 20 meters
and failed to kill them
Navid needs only 1
even on armoured targets
no vests can block navid
and light armour you can kill 3 dudes with 1 bullet from a navid
what i do
wait
wat u do?
if you don't login
for 30 days
you reset?
yes
lel
ok
THE CLOCK IS TICKING
THE GLOCK IS CLICKING
lol
ok s

DO YOU UNDERSTAND MY RAGE BRANDON
DO YOU
DO YOU UNDERSTAND IT NOW
no
that's like me writing hello world and selling it to some tech big wig for $100k
no
thats like me copying hello world from wikipedia and then selling it
yes
exactly
o
no
its like me screenshotting the code on wikipedia
and selling it
yes
people
who have money
will buy it
for stupid amounts of money
why are we not taking advantage of this
seriously
we're not marketing pros
generikb made an agar.io video
not only is he terrible at it, but it's freaking agar.io
lol
people will buy anything if you market it right
that's just like 0 effort content
i know
deco demonstrated that to me
nobody bought my flower
so i tossed it to him
he sold it for like $10k
lol
MARKETING
Did someone say marketing pro?
I can sell that $1 flower for $1785
BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE!!
BUY NOW
and GET A 2ND FLOWER
NOWNOWNOW
FOR ONLYYYY
$00
AND WE'LL THROW IN A FREE CHILD SIZED COFFIN!

SE is open source now
well, has been
didnt know that
yeah
took me 3 days to design the first page of this portfolio
egh
i am bored and tired
hm
durteh bawmbbbb
not now
but maybe later
and definitely tomorrow
stupid Charter
they keep sending me mail telling me I should use Cox
I already do use Cox
stfu and stop mailing me stuff already
this is how assembly should be taught
good god
no thank you
?
that game
lol
it looks fun
it looks like a pain in the ass
it's just a puzzle
like robozzle
except less recursive
and more mathematic
robozzle was fun
I kinda miss it
...hm
so I might use Scala for this MC mod
what's the difference?
scala is a functional language
scala
oh wow
that'd be interesting
it runs on the JVM and you can use java stuff too
but syntatically it is nicer to work with
it has stuff like type inference
that's nice
probably less wordy than java too
yes
much
things that are not less wordy than java: java
things that are less wordy than java: everything else
I'm trying to figure out how to handle dynamic sprites/models
dynamic how?
add a module to your pants, now the pants look different
tinkers just gave you a different item back after the crafting
i mean the visual
the icon
it shows the modifiers
visually
different item, different icon
no
they dont have like 93895903523 icon assets
really?
I figured they would
think about how many assets that would require
a hammer for example
oh you're talking about the weapons and stuff
takes 5 items to craft
I was thinking the travellers items
each item can be like 20 materials
they ARE just given different textures for each one
I looked
lol
that is over 300k assets for hammers alone
and no, they dont
I also looked
that would be a TERRIBLE way to do it
the mod file would be huge
i swore the chestplate had four different texture files
or something like that
anyway
how do they do it then?
They combine the parts dynamically somehow
for 2d sprites it isnt very hard I'd imagine
but 3d would probably be trickier
well 3d textures are just 2d mapped to a 3d surface for tinkers items arent they? like the wings looked like that
I dont mean textures, I mean combining meshes
in the case of 3d stuff
couldnt you just dynamically change the 2d texture that's being mapped to the 3d surface?
then the mesh doesn't change
I want something like a backpack to actually have dimension
and stick off of your back
aha
couldnt you just treat it as a separate item, rendered on the player, if it's present on the chestpiece's inventory?
maybe, I'm not sure, and that may perform worse than one mesh
it probably would be worse
importing multiple meshes is harder on the graphics card than changing one that's already imported just in general
well, on the graphics card at least
i said that already
I think i'm tired
lol
lol
i dont think the tinkers gear renders dynamically on the player
i think they just have one static mesh/texture for it
then how do they do the quartz-white effect on weapons and stuff?
and the green from moss?
i mean traveler gear
oh
tools arent a mesh/texture
tools are just 2d sprites
yeah
the boots they change I think
maybe not
but I thought they did
i dont think so
doesnt look like they do based on the assets folder
I know the item textures change
the icons
yes
not the meshes though
interesting
because meshes are harder
you can't just make a composite as easily
yeah
well if you're only making one or two changes, you could just have a mesh for each permutation
that isnt scaleable
well yeah
especially if you add in dying stuff
that'd just be texture changes though
couldnt you do those dynamically?
not if you do it that way and allow for a different color backpack than chest piece
oh I figured the backpack wouldnt be colorable
either way, brute forcing the permutations places a limit on yourself which is bad
yeah
the item-in-chest-inventory thing might be the way to go
or you could just make another inventory tab like tinkers does
well all of the data needed to know what to render will be there on the items
adding a gui or storage thing wont help
true
I can't think of any mods that really have dynamic meshes
neither can I
did modular power suits?
other than color I dont think even it did anything with meshes
nah it was all static
I thought of that earlier
well, rendering isnt a high priority for me
I can get stuff working and then figure that out later
wat
Andrew, this is a good example of how much more concise scala is than java:
class Employee(name: String, age: Int, val salary : Double) extends Person(name, age)
that is scala
public class Employee extends Person {
 private double salary;
 public Employee(String name, int age, double salary) {
   super(name, age);
   this.salary = salary;
 }
}
that is the equivalent java lol
yeeeep
that looks about right
nice
that variable declaration seems so odd
lol
thing: type
well, you can just ignore the type most of the time
yeah i figured since you said it had inference
functional languages and their colons though
there's probably a computer science joke about that
it lets you drop parenthesis and curly braces in most cases at least
there was once a functional language with colon cancer. It survived, but in the end it's colon was more of a semicolon
wat
idk i'm not very funny when I'm tired
lol
lol
whatcha up to?
reading more about scala
and waiting for lunch time to get here
I am starving
are you at work?
yes
nice :D
how's that goin?
good
working on anything cool?
just on learning scala :p
gotcha
I'll be on a scala project soon
nice
everyone else around me is working on CSS stuff it sounds like
I want to work on CSS :(
CSS is fun
really?
in a torturous kind of way
it always seemed like an absolute pain in teh ass to me lol
it can be
but I enjoy it
I'd also like to learn more about using CSS for large scale applications
so is the mod going to be your personal project thing that they have you work on?
nah
whatcha gonna do for that?
I'm not doing a 20% project for now
gotcha
that seemed like the coolest part of working for originate
lol
if you work for GE or something you're stuck writing api for dishwashers all day
yeah that seems boring
very
katie seems to enjoy it
lol
which I thought was weird
well in her case it's like writing APIs for earthquake sensors or something
yeah
still though
which is kinda like a dishwasher
they both shake
exactly
lol
the resulting tsunami cleans stuff
lol
did I mention there is a Tsunami and a Stormy in the class i'm grading for?
Tsunami Harder
and Stormy Lattimer
you mentioned Tsunami
just noticed stormy a few days ago
lol
that's such a hardcore name
Tsunami Harder
the interesting thing is they both seem like they know what they're doing
lol
so alex and I have been watching mad men these past few weeks
it's really good
we're on season 3 already
i feel like watching SG:A again :F
me3
i miss that show
such a good show
why people don't restart old shows like that is beyond me
the concepts are so good
yeah TV is really lacking good SciFi right now
firefly needs to come back
stargate needs to come back
YOU CANT TAKE THE SKY FROM MEEEEE ;(
and not as a movie like they are planning
which branch is getting a movie?
they are rebooting it
so the like 15 seasons of SG:1, SG:A and SG:U are just getting thrown out
o.o
well then
yeah it's BS
I guess it's kinda like what they did originally with the tv-original movie interaction
yes but you see
the movie was meh at best
the show was great
no the movie was horribad
lol
believe me, somehow I watched the whole thing
i give it a meh rating ONLY because it spawned the TV show
I remember like 4 seconds of it
I watched it
twice
lol
and it involved some egyptian looking people and some david hasslehoff looking dude shooting a few bad guys
haha
well this is quite unfortunate that you're working, cause I want to play durteh bawmb
but now i hav nobodeh to bawmb wit'
lol
you could just talk to your mic as if I was there
and pretend I respond
lol
and just think of some random dude as being me in the game
"oh god oh god oh god i'm gonna die"
lol
speaking of stuff
i want to play moar arma :F
me4
i need a new gun
navid
OP
my MX SW sucks balls
the navid and the cyrus are my two go-to weapons
the navid is just so loud
i like quieter weapons
cyrus it is
idk what it is
but I can't hit anyone with the cyrus
at like >200m
o.O
I ONLY hit people over 200m
lol
I may give the cyrus another try
I do wish it had better fire rate for close range
does it not have a full auto mode?
it does
but the recoil is insane in that mode
lol
second bullet is like 30 feet above the dudes head
the cyrus is expensive isnt it?
kinda
I do like having a cheap gear up cost
you can get a cyrus, two clips, and the scope/supressor/bipod setup (with the lrps or khalia)
with 1500 bucks
I seem to need like 20 clips though
I shoot a lot
i can get a rahim with accessories and like 15 mags + backpack/vest/hemlet for 1500 too
:F
yeah
the rahim is way cheaper
I carry around 30 clips on me when I have a rahim
but I get way more 1-shot kills with the cyrus
yeah I am getting tired of my shots not killing people :p
i'm pretty sure the cyrus accounts for over half of my 43 kills on that server
lol
I'll give it another try
maybe I'll actually be able to hit people
lol
something I noticed is the nightstalker is pretty much required for the cyrus
it takes too long to swap between laser designator and gun for me to keep ranges and spots lined up
yeah
I didnt have that problem with the rahim somehow
it just seemed quick
I'd probably get a DMS or LRPS as well as a nightstalker
LRPS is nice for realllly long stuff
I usually get a khalia and a nightstalker
khalia only zooms like 10x though
but yeah
I just like the scope
LRPS 25x OP
OP... nah
lol
compared to other scopes it is
if talking about zoom
I remember when the nightstalker zoomed 25x
what a glorious few weeks that was
I would have to turn my render distance up even further to make use of it
or 20x, whatever it was
I can see players at 2km on whatever the default settings are
I was sniping those guys near that ugv at 1300m but it was like in a fog
maybe my distance got reset or something
cause I turn it way up normally
at 2km they are like a slight smudge that you can only see if you really focus, but they are visible
lol
yeah that's what it was like at 2km
it was interesting cause I was actually seeing through the hill they were on with my thermal
the saif they had was on the other side but I could still see it's thermal silhouette
I'm impressed that I spelled that correct first try
public class Employee extends Person { //
Java
private double salary;
public Employee(String name, int age, double salary) {
super(name, age);
this.salary = salary;
}
}lol
ugh
this damn mouse
it pastes stuff randomly
when i click
lol
i'd just bring my own mouse
I had them order a wireless mouse
it wont be here for a few days though
so until them I am using an Apple Magic Mouse
eww
the track pad thingy for scrolling is nice
the one button = 3 buttons part isnt
yeah thats the part I hate
alex has one, and it's the reason she can't play minecraft
she would have forever ago if she had a real mouse
well, it would work
it just takes getting used to
hers is an old version that has to cmd-click for right clicking
so it doesnt have the track pad thing?
nope
ah
yeah it's like 10 years old
yeah if I press down on the right then it right clicks
but it is all 1 smooth surface
so I often click the middle instead
yeah hers is one button
which pastes stuff apparently
lol
and being just one button, I feel compelled to press the middle of it
not the left or right edge
lol yeah
I used to try and click both when i was messing with my cousin's old mouse, and was disappointed when it just middle clicked instead of doing both at the same time
mine doesnt middle click when I do that
i think it is just left clicking
intersting
inter-sting
sting, across something
yes
interesting
it's like when the police set up a sting operation to take down two gangs at once
it is an intersting operation
lol
what time do you get off work?
5 or 6
imma be bored 5evour
hi
HI
HELLO
lol arma made me turn my caps lock on
everyone was cooperating for a huge battle over the central gun store
did you kill them all?
both teams had an attack helicopter and a tank at one point or another, and yeah we ended up winning
lol nice
got 5 kills myself
sounds fun :(
only 2 until i hit 50
meh, could have been better
5 kills is a good days work in arma
lol
after that big battle we all went to the general store above agia, and I died like 4 times in a row to some kid with all the rockets ever
no joke, he fired six rockets into the general store
lol
sure it wasnt a vehicle with a large gun?
6 rockets is a lot to carry as a player
he had a car
I am tired of reading about scala
all the other devs disappeared about 20 minutes ago too
I have no clue where they went
lol
my guess: they heard that russia was giving away free bears to ride on and they fled the country
logical
either that or you're being set up for a candid camera thing
or they had a meeting
nah
yeah that is too outlandish
definitely
hmm VIP tickets to Nightwish's  north america tour are quite expensive
compared to the last tour
$175 for VIP, $35 for regular
sounds much more like a major concert
different venue or something?
reno's knitting factory instead of vegas' house of blues
so that'd be a no, not an improvement there
lol
lol, yeah
i guess it is just nightwish + delain
no sabaton
lame
so it is probably a bit more expensive for them
since costs are only split 2 ways
true
and yeah sabaton needs to come back
as a headliner
they aren't coming to north america any time in the next year it seems :(
and going to sweden in august/september sounds expensive and cold
it is almost definitely both of those things
hey
hi
i don't want to set the world on fire
then dont play with matches
i just want to start a flame in your heart!
no
<#
lol
<#3
flame in heart
( ‾ʖ̫‾)
;f
( ͠° ͟ʖ ͡°)
huh
lol
his eyebrows are under his eyes on ubuntu
o.O
they look right to me
no they should be centered not right
uh huh
yup
hurry home and play dirty bomb with me
i'll probably leave soon
like 20-40 minutes before i go
that's cool. if you middle click the new tab button on Chrome it will open a tab with the url prefilled out to whatever is in your clipboard
i discovered this once again because of this stupid mouse
the middle mouse button does sooo much more than I realized
lol
on ubuntu at least
did you know that june 9th is national donald duck day?
I did not
neither did I
until my midle click opened a tab with that as the url
lol
nao: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veblen_good
i thought that was a giffen good
that's more consumption as price rices
i remember that from micro economics
ah
home now brandone?
how was work
yes, gotta find my social security card first
brb
durteh. bawmb.
tony
join usssss
hm?
por que
dirty bomb
it's fun
back
so anywho
gotta finish eating
hurrryyyyy
nao is it worth?
well it is free
it's free
so
lol
but
mleh
so i went 25-10 with aura earlier nao
mleh?
it was a really intense fight
tony: it is fun if you enjoy fast pace shooters
on a smaller scale than battlefield
it's also team dependant
similar to LoL
it's like CS:GO meets COD meets TF2
classes/abilities
it's like tf2
but it looks good
but smaller teams
that too
it's fun
and free
^
i can play a few rounds now
okay

hey everybody
hi
sup
i am snooping beaverking's youtube
looking for good sound bites
eww
to troll them with on mumble
particularly hippos sound bites
well there are plenty of good beaver sound bites
i need text to speech software that can analyze an audio stream and give me the corresponding words with timestamps
to make sound bite creation easier
wat
why does this video of his just randomly stop
in the middle of a level
he probably forgot to check it before he uploaded, and he probably bumbed the record key or something
I did that once
but I didnt upload it
It was compressing and I was all "well fuck"
hallo
hi
i want to play moar dirty bomb
me3
my dad gets promoted to assistant chief of the chp starting july :D
cool
it inspired me to make a police-related game
oh i didnt write that it's for mobile
there'd be a gas, a brake, and gyro controls
you should make the cool looking cars be more likely to get pulled over
yeah "heat" was one of the stats I though of
because switching from the camry to the mustang, I feel like it is impossible for me to get away with going over the speed limit at all near cops
I believe that
I was actually gonna write up a survey that covered several speed limits, different kinds of cars, and different infractions over the limit to see how likely officers would be to pull that certain car in that certain situation over
then I could put as a comment in the menu - "Police emulate real decisions by real police officers"
I also thought it'd be interesting to make an app that tells you how likely you are to be pulled over in a certain type of car in a certain situation
using data from actual tickets issued if I can get it
I'd assume that level of detail isn't easily accessible
or standardized
something like "only 2% of tickets were for a new muscle car going 2mph over a 65mph speed limit"
well the records have make/model, infraction, and location
at least mine did
Idk how i'd get access to the records though
so, i decided to work from home today because my ankle hurts and I cant walk >_<
GG
whatcha workin on?
nothing
lol
haha
so
dirty bomb then?
i've been learning scala but I can only learn so much from just reading stuff
I need them to allow me access to the repo/ticket tracker
why not start writing the mod in scala?
because my foot hurts and I am starving
lol
but the kitchen is so far away
and it hurts to walk over there
"HEY MA, MAKE ME A SAMMICH AND GRAB ME A BEER!!!"
i am in a somewhat comfortable position and afraid to leave it :F
so I think I'm done working for now. Not much I can do really
lets dirty bomb :F
woo
ug
h
my headset is on the floor
and i have to move my ankle to bend over and grab it
You should splint it
i've just been keeping ice on it
it may seem like too much work, but when I sprained my ankle in football it made it SO comfortable compared to it just hanging there
you can still ice it
just grab two rulers, long socks, and some tape
eh, maybe later
lol

I am so smart. I was wondering why my ice pack didnt feel very cold.
I only put the towel on my foot
the ice pack was still on my bed
hahaha
wow
agar.io is one of the top streamed games right now
cray cray
twitch is loading really slow
why is agar so popular
its weird
yeah idk
it is weird
so dungeon realms, that mc rpg thing we played has been shut down for over a month now
they just suddenly dropped support for everything
well, the owner did
and he wants 45000 dollars for the code/licensure
perhaps because bukkit is a mess now and it seems like a real pain to do that sort of stuff
yeah
probably
pretty interesting though
it seemed like somehting that made shittons of money
who the heck is gonna pay $45k for that
nobody
I think that was the point
donde tonizzle?
wark
lame
imma go find something to eat
then i think i'll DB again
ok
my missions are back up
i will join you when you do
ok

how'd the piano stuff go?
my mom is doing it
she any good?
yeah she's playing bach and beethoven
oh wow
no
shes learning like
how to play a c chord
lol
ahh
lol
wait yall are doing piano again?
she is doing piano
oh nice
and i am just gonna have him help me learn the chords in Ghost Love Score
dude
if you learn that
i can learn the guitar part
mainly I just want to hear him play my version of sheet music so I know what a correct playthrough of it sounds like
if you promise to KEEP CONSISTENT TIMING
I think The Islander would be a fun song to do with piano/guitar
the islander?
link?
the one marco did acoustick at the show
you fellas wanna do some dirty bomb soon?
after i do my piano part, sure
when's that?
i dont wanna have to ditch a map suddenly to do that
in like 20 minutes probably
okay perfect
i'm gonna shower
just did the first day of the 30-day ab and arm challenges
they have a bit of overlap
ah nice
i'm thoroughly sore now
well
not sore
after like day 5 my abs were SUPER sore
but tired
now they arent really sore
my freakin ankle hurts though
yeah, i'm just hoping mine haven't lost ALL the training I did a few years ago
you know White Night Fantasy is also a good song that has guitar and piano
it is slower paced
you should learn something with a saxophone part
and then buy me a saxophone
lol
and then we can start a band
lol
a pianist who can't keep time, guitars, and a sax
oh i'll keep you in line time-wise
this one is far more of a mix of piano/guitar than The Islander
i'm classically trained to yell at anyone who fucks up
lol
first chair alto in band for a few years gets you that skill
lol
you know, I think the star wars cantina theme has guitar, piano, and I know it has sax
it might be bass guitar though
that's a weird song
which one?
white night
I love that song
oh that one
it is weird
lol
the singing is weird
even better: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWO5Ai_a80M
this is what I see every time Tarja's face pops up on Google Music
lol
Amaranth is also a good song for piano/guitar
Amaranth is a band -_-
no
amaranthe is a band
YES
NO
BAD
yep
also
(I know i'm just messing)
they played Electro Heart this time
which was fun
lucky
really though I think their new album trumps their older stuff
oh definitely
but electro heart
its so fun
DROP DEAD CYNICAL BA DA DA BA DA DA
lol
I love that they play that on the radio here now
lol
whenever it comes on I get a little excited
they did like a five song encore at the show
wow
three days grace didnt do one :F
fucking lol nao
lol
they played for like 3.5 hours thouhg
that's a long time
yeah
it was really long
they played a ton of their old stuff
and then their new stuff
did they have any openers?
and it was epic
yeah two
they were like 45min each
so it was like a 6 hour show?
5 or so yeah
we got there at 7 and left at midnight
i didnt like the first opener at the Amaranthe show
their singer
I thought he was a girl
till he talked
we didnt like either opener for 3dg
lol
and they were just... loud
maybe she was a guy
2nd opener was tolerable
or maybe he was a girl
they did a T Swift cover
and it was pretty good
nice
what's their name?
I prevail
ah, not the same one I was thinking of
jared found one a while ago that was pretty good
same song
they were fun, good energy on the stage
so uhhh
yeah
damn dude
you shoulda seen it like 3 hours ago tony
??
before the banned r/fatpersonhate
top 10 or so posts were all from that sub
okay so why did they have to ban fatpersonhate in the first place?
new ceo and stuff
trying to make reddit a "safe place"
ohhhhh
gotcha
they banned a few subs
well that's horrible
now pople are all like "gimmie my free speech"
reddit should be totally open
yeah
I get that
that was one of the pulls of reddit
it was totally whatever people wanted to create a sub for
now the front page is a bunch of hate against reddit's CEO
well
well done
maybe they'll change their mind like they changed steam/bethesda's mind
lol
doubt it
its digg2.0
well currently like every major subreddit has become a circlejerk
so we're gonna have to start over with a whole new website again?
voat.co
if they keep it up long enough I guess reddit will probably go the way of digg/myspace/whatever other dead site
isnt that the one that you can get paid for your submissions or something?
voat.co?
yeah
I don't think so
maybe
its a freespeech platform
did you link it a few days ago?
yes
then that's the one
it was top article when i clicked
you can recieve some of the add money? o.O
voat.co is loading super slow for me
its been hugged to death
too many migrants
lol
GG
well, if they can't handle the traffic then they're not gonna get the swappers for long
I imagine that will get sorted out
lol
I hope
reddit hates that stuff
but does reddit hate censorship more?
/r/skyrim and /r/gaming have been complaining about problems with ESO for a few days now
probably
but if they can't log onto and speak their mind on one site, and the alternative they can't even load the page, I think they'll just drop dead
cynical
lol
see I can do it too :P
Saxophone?
I can play sax
only 2 of those were appropriate though
I think your mom is perfectly appropriate for any situation
kek
topkek
lel
kik
;p;
juj
jejejeje
voat only took 4 minutes to load
lol
afk
me4
welp
that chick the CEO?
yea
lol
im surprised that sub isnt more popular
she filed a lawsuit against gender discrimination
for 2.7million
and her husband
owes
2.7million
for running a ponzy scheme
interesting huh
she lost that suit btw
"a community for 2 hours"
is why its not busy
hi
hi
games?
sure, which?
also WHY DOES EVERYONE WAN TOT GAME AT 830
well
8+3 is 11'
and 11 is a number
which indicates
a box
roughly the shape of a computer case
so
games
dirty bomb or arma depending on who is here
down for DB
ok
lemme finish my popsicle
yep i'm good for DB
finished my popsicle
its raining here :(
anywho

hi
hi
hello
supdoge
just ate lunch
now i learn moar scala
scalalalala
scala is weird
driew si alacs
so did you see the oculus announcement?
no
they showed the final consumer version set to release in Q1 
also some new controller they made
that has hand tracking
no price point set though
$600
it'll probably be close to the cost of DK2
steam sale looks meh
oh, did the summer sale start?
yes
fun
darkest dungeon is on sale
i'll wait for a flash sale though
yeah, it'll definitely go below 25%
sale didnt look horrible
you see the problem is I already own all the games I want
the game they have set up is overloaded
and yet I have played almost none of them
lol
durteh bawmb
i want to play it
but
i am at work
just had a match that went for 26 minutes
playing stopwatch
do you know if the oculus works with dirty bomb?
no clue
I don't see anything in the settings about it though
hmmm
i saw a few videos of it on youtube but i didnt watch them
since i am at wok
wokwokwok
why does this exist
someone pays for that
that's... okay
someone went there and their laptop started blasting that lol
lol
that's probably exactly why it exists
i want a game with a good story
like The Last Of Us or Amnesia
except something new
fallout is really good storywise
it's as big as skyrim though
so huge time investment
is it as rich as TLoU?
is anything?
no
:F
hi
hi
I have exhausted the guns stores in town looking for my rifle
at least ones that sell old weapons
find it
on the internet
too hard to find a good one on the internet
seems like it would be harder to find a good one in person
what gun are you looking for?
you can't check condition on the internet
Steyr-Mannlicher M95
you can email them and ask questions/request pictures
that's a nice looking gun
Isn't it?
Its got a straight pull bolt as well
and fires a large caliber round
i wan2 go home
I want a m95
ohai
ohello
voat is literally reddit
in terms of function and appearance
yup
but not administration
so thats what counts
but is there a nice voat app for me to use on my phone?
make it, include an ad, get money
too much wok
make it a hybrid app, then it's easy and almost all the work is done for you already!
they even have an API
too bad the server is under too much load for me to see it
i have listened to... 22 minutes of that 3.5 hour recording
for sound bites
I have gotten like 3 or 4 so far
lol
imma just call it there and be happy with the 4 that I got
one of them is really good
lol
...
want
what are these recordings
anyone down for games?
cant right now
papers please for $3
D: we're playing dirty bomb now?
nah
i just left it open on accident
lol
D: damn
what is this though seriously
thurdsay night
i'm off tomorrow
ready to game
and no one
is on
oh

i am doing the scala koans
koans?
yessir
wassat?
it's like the ruby koans
except scala
i have no idea what koans are
lol
"Koans are small lessons on the path to enlightenment. The aim of the Scala Koans project is to provide an easy learning environment in Scala. Your insight will be derived by encountering failing tests and fixing them so that they pass. A testing framework is used to simplify this process and to get you off to a good start with using Scala."
aha
sounds like fun
afk
fak
is tonizzle home for the day?
because andross is play some dirty bomb
tonizzle is home
tonizzle is making logizzles
logizzles huh
are those like gangsta lozenges?
anyway
I think i like sawbones more than aura
his smg is similarly good
and the medpacks are better than the station IMO
instant effect is great
lol i'll join up after food
alrighty
Anthony Humphreys
13741
13741

thanks andrew
thanks obama
I sent him an apple
core
because I ate it already
so I had my 1 on 1 with Alex a moment ago
we got on the topic of using Scala to mod minecraft
he googled it a bit
and found an online class thing about it
interesting
and the he was like "oh... it's taught by a 13 year old..."
and he reads a bit about him
totally discounting him, because he's 13
kid already works for google?
then reads that the dude has presented at Scala Days in , 13, 14, and 15
and was just like
"well fuck"
"I was nothing like that when I was 13"
lol
some of our devs are presenting at Scala Days
and this kid presented there at 13....
haha
badass
I barely knew code existed when i was 13
video games just appeared for me
the disk had magic on it that made the computer/xbox make noise and pictures
I often wondered how games worked when I was younger
I had no clue how they worked, but I wondered!
lol
double xp for dirty bomb this weekend
helllll yeaaahhhh brudder
I think it started already
today that is
I didnt notice though
i need 8k more to get my first character
gonna buy bushwacker
because nader is too gay
or whatever her name is
you dont like nader?
I made the mistake of buying the sniper guy
nade spam is meh
you should look at fletcher
what did he do? sticky grenades?
skip to like 2hr15
at work still
lol
this dude is insane
ah
well yeah
sticky grenades
what type of main weapon?
shotgun
and any 2nd ability?
no 2nd I don't think
nope
but yeah
he's pretty sweet
he could be fun
i dont really like shotguns though
he's very very mobility dependant
you have to be quick
I think you'd like sawbonez
his starter smg is pretty good already
aura's healing thing is more powerful in groups though
and i like the gun I have with her
well you could be double medic
nah
lol
that's not useful
fragger is good
too slow
I was using him again earlier
I like being fast
knife makes him pretty quick
yes but knife also makes aura very quick
proxy is ridiculously fast
so the relative slowdown is still there
fletcher is fast
kira is pretty fast
Fletcher can have the blishlock
that smg?
yeah
nice
bbl
k
Fletcher is a possibility
either him or bushwacker
because an engineer would be nice and I have a good loadout for bushwacker
what a badass
there Grohls my hero
watch him as he Grohls
dave grohl #1 badass
Hola
I found my gun
crazy weather here today

I BOUGHT GUN
FINALLY

Yes

Luftwaffe Mauser k98
They gave me free ammo for the steyr
pretty
cause it gave them the willies

The ammo is all nazi marked
the k98 has swastikas all over it too
lol
haha wow

i'm thinking i might get the Borderlands 2 GOTY edition. Nine bucks, all the dlc, and I thought it was really fun when nao and I did coop on my xbox
i found a script that automatically moves me between lanes on the steam monster game to get me money while AFK
lol
do you get cards for that?
you get something
idk how it works
I found a better script
it auto changes lanes and it auto clicks 20x per second
sounds like it's very illegal since you can make money off the cards :P
no
I guess it is their fault they left that possibility in
you get like points or something
to upgrade stuff
you dont get cards
ah
durteh bawmb?
there's a limit of 200ish points anyways
cant
gotta go back to DMV soon
go back?
it was a 4 hour wait so we left
lol
currently am place 157 in the queue
wow
makes me appreciate the fact that my dad can get my brother and I in immediately so much more
lucky
lol
yeah it's pretty convenient
although it's not like our DMV is nearly as busy
there are only like 20 people waiting at any point in time
not 157
we had like 350 people ahead of us
o.o
wow
so i've been watching dirty bomb streams
and all of them are listening to chillstep while going insane and getting like 100 kills in a stopwatch match
every single one
I want hot dogs
Imma make hot dogs
where are these streams?
on twitch i only see small DB streams
they're small
just ones with 100ish viewers
like 30-5 people?
all i see is like <30 people
one is TheMercs (not online)
DreoUK is who i'm watching now
he's pretty good
not the best tho
Kudochop is the fletcher I was talking about
he's really good
also not online tho
themercs and kudo are usually on later at night
and probably only weekdays
lots of main streamers take weekends off
and those two both had a couple hundred viewers
the dreo dude i'm watching now just hit 200 followers a minute ago
he's trying to play with viewers though
which is cool
do you know if fletcher's sticky bombs are effective against the EV?
i probably have time for 1 or 2 matches, actually
if you want to play
i just made lunch but it's flaming hot so sure
and they're not terribly effective against the EV
it probably takes like 12 of them (you get 3 at one time, and they respawn really quickly)
Brandon Worl
Brandon Worl
so I have a bronze loadout for skyhammer, aura, and proxy now
and one for arty and bushwacker, but I don't have them
hi

i'll be on in a sec

voat went up 45,000 places in 1 day
interesting
I did some followup on what went on, apparently the bans were for "behavior" not content, and they're allowing any legal content to be posted as long as it stays within it's subreddit
well, they banned like tooons of subreddits
hating on fat people isnt illegal
yeah, apparently they were all bringing their hate and content (like fat people hate) to other subreddits
lol
well banning FPH only made things worse, clearly
like, posting in slimtips about how everyone there is a fatass and should go die
yep
it made things worse
but it really didnt hurt as much as it seems
now there are like 1000 FPS subreddits
er
FPH
which was fine
they didnt care
they banned the behavior
not the content
or so they say
that still goes against the original creator of reddit's wishes
yeah
but the owner hired the chick
so meh
no, he left
the board of whoever chose her
the current owner and board, yeah
after the fact
not the OG
yep
but what stays OG forever anyway?
OG
Original Gangsta
yo
so
DB?
in a minute yeah
ok

meh to all mobas

we need a moba zombie game
didnt you play dayz?
we should make that
for sure
i guess L4D is like a FPS moba
I played dayz for 2 hours
max
kinda
and decided
meh
and it was just the mod
it was meh
so much bug
i played dayz for a while
the mod
I got tired of dying incessantly
i found a good loot spot at the edge of cherno
and got stuff
and killed people
and died
and repeated
eneh frendleh in chernooooo?
i once broke my leg
on a ladder
oh
no
it wasnt a ladder
i walked through a door
and broke it
lol
in the middle of cherno
with people all around killing each other
guacamole
i crawled for over an hour
sneakily
guac sounds amazing
and got to the hospital
it was actually quite exciting
I had peanuts, an apple, an orange, and half a chocolate/banana/peanutbutter smoothie
for dinner
I had nine fine irishmen
cannibal
Irish aren't humans
neither are scots
and why not?
they are, how you say? Dirty.
aha
speaking of dirty

level 7 railgun, level 6 earth
these nukes
deez nooks
deez noobs
I think a game built with exploiting like this as an intended mechanic would be cool
54m for next railgun D:
lol
there's an old game called hack n slash
where you have to alter the gamecode
(so i've read)
its gonna take me like 3 bosses to get the next railgun
what level?
dang how you so rich
oh
i am also gonna upgrade to 9
lol
want to do a round or 3 of dirty bomb?
no one has range :<
yes i do
rain*
yeah, rain is mostly all gone now :(
i am 11m from level 9 railgun
Brandon Worl
Anthony Humphreys
Brandon Worl
Anthony Humphreys
hallo
komrade how we make disc of goings?
n e 1 here
NO
woo level 10 railgun
lol
how long did that take
3.4m dps now
uhh
nice
a long time
lol
its so slow
to do stuff
well, I have blackout curtains now. maybe the sun will stop waking me up at like 6am
lol
i keep dying now
nobody is using health things :(
actually i just upped my health from like 70-80k to 509k
problem solved
lol
That's where mine was
I joined one of the main steam game rooms
room #3
we're on level 1711 so far
and I just came back to it from like 50 minutes of being away
and had 43 thousand million coins
(thats 43 billion)
lol
soo much money
so many upgrades
we had like 200 raining golds at once
in the early levels
wow
i just got my first paycheck from grading
I have level 10 titanium mouse button
i have no idea what that means
lol
you watch e3 at all?
it does armor piercing -> explosive -> railgun -> new mouse button -> titanium mouse button
i didnt even know titanium was a tier until today
lol
and no
i heard it wasnt much, other than fallout 4
halo was cool
nathan fillion
new game for xbone called recore
oh yeah, that would have been cool
seemed interesting
almost level  now
my previous max was 500ish
after an entire day
you at work?
yes
lol
lol'
it's playing itself while I do scala koans
aha
oh
dishonored 2 got announced
i'm psyched for that
dishonored was great
also toxikk is on sale
12 bucks
ooh
i am bread for $4.41
what about I am toast?
is that a thing?
no
lol
so, how many hours did you have on your paycheck?
lol
5.5 on the next one
that isnt many hours lol
yeah
it was just one assignment
do they have many graders for the class?
two, I do the design assignments and some other chick does the programming assignments
ah
level 4100
150 billion coins
(thats 150 thousand million coins)
(or 150 thousand thousand thousand coins)
(or 15 hundred hundred hundred hundred hundred coins)
(or .15 trillion coins)
numbers
indeed
the hundreds one was a real thinker
getting 257 million coins per second on this boss
lol
lol
insane
i get like 100 or so
lol
i dont run hax scripts though
are you using the script?
oh
the script is the only way, man
i dont cheat unless I wrote it myself :P
it isnt cheating
it is furthering the cause
uh huh
the steam group even says not to join a main room if you arent gonna use the script
lol
my work laptop has insufficient wam to run this script optimally
download moar wam for the swerver
i need more ded-d-tated waaam
waaaaaaaaaaaaaaammmmmmmmmmmmmm
hi
hi
802 billion coins \o/
level 11250
hi
hi
lol
o/
there's an auto upgrade buyer script lol
once i get to 1000 billion coins I guess I'll activate that script
altis life?
who is here?
so toxikk is on sale
idk wat is
i'm not sure if it's worth the $12
me
welp the script just spent 1000 billion coins in the most optimal way possible
the new xbox controller looks nice
damn it is expensive
htf do you have 1bil coins
i had 1,000 billion
thats 1 trillion
son
dayum
i am in room #3
thats how
we're all using the script
and we dont have any idiots nuking the bosses in the early levels
T_T
we're at level 1
we use nukes now because bosses have insane health at this level
and speed is more important than money now
(sigh( i can't join
nope
you cant join if the room is over 10 minutes old
my next upgrade costs 622B
jeae
what are you all up to?
i am contemplating food
I had a taco salad
mmmm tacos
im gonna go make a burger or something
brb
ok
lololol
jeb's presidential logo
why do all the candidates have crap tier logos
because they don't have me
Well they have 14 year olds and paint.net
his logo would almost be able to be taken seriously if it said 1970 instead of  under it
Yes
oh god
next free reotation on dirty bomb is vassili, rhino, and bushwacker
that is going to SUCK
lol
wat is plan
dunno
ok portfolio time
the new ratchet and clank looks good
too bad it is a PS4 exclusive
lol @ console exclusives
same with ps4
wat
wat
ffvii remake
i'm psyched for that
I spent like 100 hours playing the OG
hi
we're all here we should do altis life
mehhh
i'm feeling some DB
i could do DB
I can in like.. 20-30 minutes
i want to make popcorn
just eat regular corn
no tengo
you'll get poopcorn as a bonus the next day
lol
layout blargh
blargh
indeed
so we gun DB?
yeh
i probably can't chat tho
unless you guys dont mind tv sounds
ddddddirty
bbbbbbombbbbb
whar did tony go
idk
i shall steam msg him
alwyas as i'm about to sleep
fo reaLS
so early
it's only 930
play til 1030
be a happy persong
be a tired person*
am miserable
can't be happy until new job
nah it'd be grate
have some coffee
so
i am start stopwatch matches now
whelp, won the match with 12k points and went 31/6 with aura/proxy
sounds like a good stopping point
lol
i am trying to get this stupid thing to compile and run
i'll probably be back on in like 30mins
just the base mod stuff with no content so far?
yes
and it isnt running scala yet
nice, it took me a while to get that going as well
that was with a tutorial too
my problem was that I was using the java 1.8 jdk
aha
which isnt supported
mine was that my eclipse environment went wonky
im using IntelliJ IDEA
instead of eclipse
because I hate eclipse
how was setting that up? i only saw tuts for eclipse
not bad
i followed an eclipse tutorial
well
the editor really didnt matter
for the tutorial
it used gradle to set it all up
yeah when i gradled i guess i had some files missing
i just did gradlew setupDevEnvironment idea
instead of eclipse
or whatever the command was
looks right
it had a hard time finding everything for some reason
so I just redownloaded everything and it worked the second time
i downloaded and installed the scala plugin
i just dont know how to enable it...
lol
need lessons from a 13 year old?
i know a couple
well there's that 13 year old scala genius
lol thats what i mean
but he only ever did bukkit
ah
lame
well
back to DB
aha! :D
it now uses scala
noice
MY INTERNET
IT LIVES
after 2 hours
of cox sucking
lol
see what I did there?
no can you please clarify?
oh I made a pun
I am building a KSP basebuilding and combat multiplayer mod pack
their fletcher was insane
gtg tho
:F
lol
i killed him a few times
he did manage to stick my face once though
he stuck me once or twice
and smg'd me a few times
but i killed him quite a few times with proxy mines lol
jeeze we still have hundreds of raining gold being used on bosses
elite dangerous and distance are on sale
I want them both
the new terraria update comes out soon doesnt it?
looks like 1.3 comes out at the end of the month
we should all do a terraria 1.3 playthrough
agreed
i miss terraria
yeah it's good fun derping around
looks like some cool new stuff
hmm movie studio is 34% off via steam
it would be nice to use a legit copy
the cracked version I used had... issues
seems like a lot of good changes
yeah
enough new content to be interesting again
it'd be interesting if we just played again
the previous update added tons of stuff that we never really got to
yeah
did we even play 1.2?
for a short time, yeah
what was the main stuff added in 1.2?
tons of new items
i forget what though
lol
i just remember we got to hard mode and got raped
basically
a lot of the stuff was post hardmode
someone made a binary to decimal calculator in terraria
wow
that's dedication
yessss I finally finished the Scala Koans
noice
you feel like you know scala now?
well I have no doubt I can write scala
I doubt it would be good scala
I see
you start on that mod yet?
other than just printing preInit, init, and postInit messages, no
gotcha
I'm trying to figure out how other mods handle versioning
I was wondering that about lots of things
right now I have to set the version number in like 4 places
which is gross
versioning seems difficult
you would think you would only have to set it in the mod info file
you'd think
there are probably just oddities with forge that make it required in four places
but that totally seems like something I would forget in one spot and make a release and then realize I messed up
and have to push a fix
which is annoying
there's a lot of mods written with scala on github
i dont recognize most of the authors though
interesting
silly steam
their after-game popup came open, i accientally clicked on it, clicked on a game accidentally, and bought it because it looked cool
lol
they got me
lol
what game?
bit dungeon 2
one of the game sale ones
for 2.50
it's frequently updated
and it looked like a good "i'm bored as fuck" game
people keep talking about ram
i just want to say ded-d-tated wam
but nobody will get it
and i'll look stupid
lol
"Goddamn. Gamers smell like shit. ‪#‎e3‬"
my cousin (i think?) on FB
she's from the asian half so who knows what my real relation to her is
lol
probably half sister twice removed
i dont think so, but I dont actually know what twice removed means
so maybe
i think it's a different way of saying the whole second/third cousin/otherthing kinda deal
but i could be wrong and spewing things out my ass
or i could not be wrong and spewing things out my ass
you never know
either way your ass is probably spewing i guess
seems that way
well it isnt healthy to hold it in
true
so tinkers construct has over 100 contributors on github
no wonder why the code is trash
wow
yeah
i r bore
so it should be possible to only update the version number in the gradle.properties file
EnderIO does it that way with some magic java annotation thing
interesting
I can't figure out how to design my mod with some way for other mods to integrate with it
I'd like other mods to be able to create their own armor modules and register them with my mod
or register materials (with accompanying art assets) for armor plates, etc
make an API like tinkers was attempting to do
but I cant think of any open source mods that do that
i cant think of any open source mods that use tinkers API
to see how it works
ExtraTiC isnt open source
yeah idk
mechworks?
that doesn't use the api i believe
wasnt sure
and even then there seems to be multiple ways to both make and use APIs
yeah
basically as I see it: make functions for creating X item type, and make your mod take care of the setup and integration
you
you're essentially making an engine rather than a mod
kinda
conceptually anyway
that's basically how an API with various interfaces works
yeah
But I'm not sure how to do that
lol
lol
it seems weird to me that mods put the api in the same package as the rest of the mod
i'd start with the basics
well it makes sense
your mod should use the api to create the items and stuff
Except that if I want to distribute the API, I dont want to also have to distribute my mods implementation
the API is just an interface
well you don't have to do the mod stuff with the api if you make the api first
as in, it exposes methods of the main mod
all the API does is make certain methods of your actual mod visible to other mods, by not obfuscating those methods
as far as I can tell
which is all fine and good, but how do I distribute just the API if it is all in the same package?
that's what I dont get
what do you want people to be able to do with the api?
Register new modules/materials
so then just write the code for that
your mod can be separate
and use those api functions
but the API doesn't actually contain logic
it is kinda like a C++ header
it just tells you method names, their arguments, and their return type
ahhh
welp, they managed to get past level 300,000 in a little over an hour today on the steam monster game
for comparison, yesterday they only reached like 50k
after 24 hours
jeeze
the guy streaming room #1 has 134 trillion coins
and they are on level 479254 now
terraria otherworld looks like it could be cool too
wassat?
it seems like terraria
is there a difference?
it's basically terraria 2
except redigit says it isnt terraria 2
(but we all know it is)
the main thing is there's a purpose to it now
you are in a world that is all corrupt and you have to cleanse it
or something
also it might have infinite worlds, im not sure
sup
supper

lol
there is a 95% chance Thal is going to link this to me: http://i.imgur.com/5KPAvrj.webm
I'll let you know if I get it first
lol
lol
that was humerous
so funny I broke my leg
lol
i dislike how work has me stressed out enough that i can't stop thinking about it
I used to be able to leave work and leave the thoughts -_-
haaaaeeeet accounting
drugs
they'll solve everything
wat
drink your worries away
tons and tons of drugs
so many drugs that you become a colombian drug lord and have warrants for your arrest in 12 different countries
and then you get rich
no more worrying about job
10/10 plan
then you get arrested
no more job
turn your life around with drugs

KSP mod pack sample
hi
hi
sup
working on my mod
coo coo
at work?
i guess it is scala
working from home
it's actually one of my OKRs lol
I HAVE to make the mod by the end of the year
oh wow
nice
as one of the measurements as to whether or not I have learned scala sufficiently
lol
lol that's sweet
I won't get actual project work until Monday
so I figure this is the best I can do for hands on experience for now
definitely
what part are you working on?
I have 137 trillion coins on the steam game now
lol
lol
just gradle config stuff
almost have that working
you should stream it
then I'm gonna work on armor base classes and such
i'm not set up to stream :F
lol
actually shadowplay can stream cant it?
yeah
trying to stream
so that bit dungeon game i got for 2.50 could be better
lol
it's fun
but for some reason the control scheme they chose is fucking terribad
you can either use the mouse, and only the left mouse button for everything
or you can use wasd, and the a key also has a function if you hold it down
ending stream for now
okey
lemme know when you're bored, I'm available for some DB until like 4
if this fails to compile i will have to rage quit for an hour or two
lol
O_O
When i download open computers and run it, it also shows ${version}
so maybe it was working this whole time
it just doesnt show it in debug mode
did you run it in non-debug mode?
yes
still does the thing
so i'm trying the actual jar in regular minecraft+forge
sounds like a lot of work just to get the version to show up lol
HAAAAAA IT WORKED
SUCK IT
IT WORKS
FOR REAL THIS TIME
it only took 5 hours
it was probably correct the entire time
but hey
whatever
it works
lol
so it was just debug mode?
or rather, not running a full jar
yeah
well GG
lol
it works, that's all that matters
I can stop worrying about project setup and start working on actual content
anyways, DB break?
sure :D
Brandon Worl
Brandon Worl
huh
modular powersuits is written in scala
interesting
it should give me a good idea of how to do my mod lol
since it's pretty similar
it's open source?
yeah
interesting
didnt know that
so I guess the first thing I'll add in some sort of reinforced leather with a crafting recipe
and then I'll add the base unmodified armor pieces
holy crap
charter sent me ANOTHER letter suggesting I use Cox
that's 4 so far
they send one every week
adding an item to a mod is a lot of work
Hi
hi
yeah every item requires a bunch of registry entries and stuff
and icon registries
and yeah
it looked like a pain
DRUGS IT IS
send a letter to charter suggesting they stop using cocks
wat
<<< 
yes
well once you make the framework for handling items, making new items isnt bad
it's just the first one is bad
since you have to make a bunch of helper things for registering icons/textures/unlocalized names/etc
which I mostly have done now
I just need an actual texture...
and then I need to add the recipe register
also I just passed level 3,100,000 on the summer game
How much was your ticket btw?
still dont know
ticket?
traffic citation
oh shit dude
waah
yeah tony, I ran a green light
speeding were ya
no
i ran a green light
why did the officer pull you over and did you get snippy?
or was it automatic?
Look at the kerbal plane I made guyzzz
i got pulled over for running a green light
why did they say you got pulled over
like seriously
he can't've said "you ran a green light"
they said i ran a red light
pft
here's what happened
if you want you cn dispute it
left turn
3 cars ahead of me
2 made it through
3rd guy saw the cop pull up to make a right turn onto the same road
he saw a cop so he got nervous or whatever
and stopped
oh good god
in the intersection
so you passed him
and turned
then kept going
so i followed
sometimes it's bullshit man :/
(I was already partially in the intersection when he stopped)
people are stupid drivers
yeah if your back tires are past the line you should be clear
light probably did turn yellow/almost red by then
was probably red when I got through
cop got mad
i pulled in to a parking lot that was like 2 seconds away
oh
instead of RIGHT OVER
he said I "failed to stop when he turned his lights on"
that happens -_-
it's such bullshit
it was late at night at an intersection, it was muuuch safer in the parking lot
that was literally right beside us
unfortunately dude that was just a no win situation where the dude was on a power play
probably jelly of your sharkbite car
it's because I'm young in a nice car and I was on the strip at midnight
he complimented my car at the end
lol
fucking dick
yeh
he asked me like 9000 times if I was drunk
wtf
they like that game
yeah
gonna dispute it
try to get it down to a parking ticket
Mr. Craig P. Kenny, attourney at law (or something) has handled tons of my brothers tickets
lol
costs like $50 and he'll go to court for you and get it reduced
still gotta pay a fine but at least it won't jack up my insurance
hm
ugh
i dont know how to make a constant with scala...
it doesn't look like scala has constants
lol I am getting 1 trillion coins per second on the summer game now
what is the benefit of playing it again?
upgrading my badge
you need to reach level 1 million to get the max badge
aha! I have a textureless functionless nameless item!
PROGRESS
WOO
I didn't expect it to be textureless or nameless though
so that's confusing
oh I forgot to register the item
silly me
wait no i didnt :(
ha! it has a texture now
it's really stupid how I had to do it though
I just say val test = ItemRegistry
in preInit
so the ItemRegistry singleton gets instantiated there
>_>
which is essentially how Modular Power Suits does it too
which is just weird
its actually if your front tires are in the intersection before the light turns red, you're good
that's how traffic cameras work
they can't see rear tires most of the time
they were definitely past the stop line while it was green
yeah i believe you
the cop was just an asshole
if it was one of my dad's dude's they would have had you explain, and if you KNEW that your front tires were literally waiting past the line, they would have let you off
but that guy was just assuming you were a douche who runs red lights
lol
young kid
good lookin
mustang
enjoying vegas life
fuck 'im
with a stripe
"nice car bro"
its the stripe that does it
lol no the stripe makes it go faster
when it's read by radar
lol
hehe
that's what my dad always says
I put my new license plate frame on today
no more derpy black plastic frame
nice chrome metal frame now
gahhh
this item
no "i'm hot shit" text on it? gay
it displays the name now... as "Reinforced Leather.name"
lol why
i have no clue
also the creative tab is missing its name
weird
check youtube for a tutorial series by tech<somethingorother> if you want
he had the creative tab and an item made
second episode I think
I'm following a 1.7 tutorial
:/
yeah that's what it is
idk
maybe seeing another bit of code will help
I have to adapt everything though
to scala
lol
oh right
so MPS is probably really useful
well kinda
its directory structure is different than mine
and I don't like how it does some stuff
so I'm doing it differently
lol
in a way that I think scales better
gotcha
aha!
just editing the lang file to have .name fixed the item name
want me to mess around with textures for the base armor item?
well, this is just the item used to craft the base armor pieces
what's it called?
but yeah sure if you want to make textures I wont stop you
lol
reinforced leather
what'd you want it to look like?
it'll probably be like 3 leather and 6 string to craft
leather and string
really?
lol
or maybe i'll make it more expensive
idk
yeah
iron probably at least a bit of
maybe, but it'll have metal plates added on afterward
it's reinforced afterall
so having iron in the base thing seems weird
well how is it stronger than normal leather
the base armor isn't gonna offer much protection
probably same as leather
just inf durability
and upgradeable
gotcha
ooh
iron nuggets?
are those a thing?
lol
nope, not in vanilla lol
could do some kind of studded design and have the nuggets be part of it
but there are no nuggets
could use like iron bars
gold nuggets then
bling bling
lol
they're malleable
did you ever see The Langoliers?
nope
the stephen king movie
oh
well
the freaky guy in it kinda looks like SethBling
lol
good movie
i rewatched it last night
woo everything has names now
now to add the recipe stuff
nice
okay so texture size?
16x16 is vanilla
but any power of 2 works
and stylistically do you want it to fit with vanilla?
i dont like super high res
but like 32x32 or maybe even 64x64 works
nah i was thinking either 16 or 32
yeah
i'd say try 32 first
well if you're going to go 64 at any point it'd be better to start with that
scaling up is harder than down
just dont pull a Draconic Evolution and put pictures of high resolution puke in every texture
haha
yeah
32x32 is good
i like the grainy vanilla look
lol
i was gonna pull faithful's textures and look at what they did
right now my placeholder texture is a square with an x in it lol
....yall making your own texture? :3
minecraft textures
for my mod
any way i can help?
ooooooooooh!
cool
well, I just added an item
reinforced leather
if i have time i can logo-ize it for ya
which needs a sprite. ap is working on it but you could try too
ooh
a logo would be useful
i'll let ap handle that
no rush because I'm not going to announce this until it has a release ready
which wont be for a while
gimme a name, elements you like, examples of what you like/dislike, and what you want the logo to convey
yeah that's fine
Gear Up
probably wont' have time for a bit
is the name
it isnt futuristic
because all the other armor mods are
the idea is that you have basic leather armor and you add stuff to it
like pistons to jump higher
or a backpack
lol this is like the ship customizability
beastly
or armor plates
i remember your t2 shipmod
lol
yeah

I think I have become addicted to root beer
I have it like every day
There are worse things to be addicted to.
like the mj
or the crack
or facebook games
the way this mod handles adding recipes seems weird
so i have determined that i am horrible at pixel art that follows some kind of style guide (vanilla textures)
buuut I can't really think of a superior method
you know tinkers already has reinforced leather
or was it openblocks
that was pams harvestcraft
really?
yes
lol
so, thought time:
it was just studded leather with a darker texture
the way this example mod handles items is, it has a item recipe registry file
which adds all spahed and shapeless recipes
I thought it'd be better to just keep recipes attached to the item itself rather than all in this registry file
but that has issues where you just have like utility recipes that arent really associated with an item you add to the game
but having a giant file of recipes seems ugly too
but I dont see a better solution
I think the file is a fairly good solution
keeping the recipes with items would be great though
why not both?
utility recipies in a file
because then you're doing both
item recipes with the items
yeah but it makes sense in that case
they are basically separate tasks
yeah
so doing them in different ways could be preferrable
just a thought
it'd be easy enough to split it up like that
I dont actually have any utility recipes in mind
well what's an example of a utility recipe?
like if I wanted to make a way to make mossy cobble
by combining cobble with grass
ah
gotcha
that isnt associated with any of my added items
so something that makes a block or item that already exists, and your mod isnt adding it
gotcha
well then I would separate them
but you dont have to do the full on file thing
the only potential issue with separating them is that i dont know if recipes have to be instantiated at a particular point in the loading process
just comment a section at the bottom of your items file for "utility recipes" or something
and it they are all in 1 spot I can easily just make it all happen at the right location
right, so do them separate, but in the same file/load area
I'll try separating them just to see if it works
would be nice to know I guess
well I dont want to iterate over all items
because then I need a list of items that is iterable
to initialize the recipes on every item
isnt that what the registry is for
?
I was planning on just doing it in the constructor
meaning I dont really get the ability to choose when it happens
it will happen when the items get registered
gotcha
which might be okay, idk
lol
lol
new territory
we'll see I guess
no other mods do it this way
afaik
flow with the go if it doesn't work
im sure you'll find out why they all do it that way lol
there's very little consistency with mods
and like 1000 ways to do everything
and no explanation of which way is best
add learning a new language on top of that and you've got yourself a fun time
oh hey
Botania does recipes this way
lol
sorta
vazkii breaks the recipe out to its own class file
ok so i realized that besides "I'm here to fuck shit up" songs I like "let's gtfo in style"
wat
y u question me so Ian
cause
ah
yiss
working recipes
it's really janky though
scala doesnt like the addShapedRecipe function
probably because that function is retarded
and I feel like I should be able to fix it with an implicit, but my implicit doesnt seem to be doing its job :(
nao
what was the first thing that came to your mind when I did the Graphit Logo?
trying to collect comments
uhh
that was a year ago
yeah i realize
i'm hunting for quotes and it's fucking difficult
i dont remember what the first thing that came to my mind was
probably something like "damn, that's nice"
but idk exactly
that's what I've got so far
i'll take it
welp
that's a good bit of progress
I learned more about scala from that than I did from doing the scala koans for 3 days
and I have a few questions lined up to ask the scala wizards at Originate tomorrow
AWESOME
er
awesome
such enthusiasm
ok collected quotes
"Damn, that's nice." - Brandon Worl, Client
"""i personally love it. i think it's like 50x better than what we had previously
and i'm excited to get the input from the content specialist. i think this is gonna slay"" - James Riley, Client"
"I dig." - Ryan Andrews, Client
"He's so freaking good my jeebus" - TJ Cole, Client
such a myriad of personalities
Can I be a client?
I'll pay you with a quote
yeah I made Deco & Son
"die commies" - Ian Romans
oh
I'm a client
lol you are
"Fills me with hate for Commies, 10/10; would use again" - Ian Romans
pass
you wanna be actually quoted ?
i'm trying to think of what you actually said all those years and years ago
༼つ ◕_◕ ༽つ
lol
one of the twitch summer game rooms just jumped 2.7 million levels
they moved 2.7 million levels in just a few minutes
lol
just 2 days ago people said 300k after 24 hours was impossible
i joined a new room. we went from level 100 to 7800
lol
in about 20 seconds
could have gone a few million if people didnt use abilities on the boss
so, I bought the splinter cell pack for $10 and metal gear solid V for $5
it might be fun to revisit Chaos Theory on PC
have any of you played Homebrew?
havent played it but it definitely looks interesting
yeah, reviews say it is buggy though
so I'll wait on buying it
how is it not even 11 yet
T_T
lol
yeah
2early
almost 3early
I don't have anything to dooooooo
go home
so boredddddd
i want to eatttttt
fooooooooood
lol
apparently donald trump paid actors to attend his campaign announcement
and just stand in the crowd cheering
lol
not surprised
$50 per person
well that's kinda cheap
well I mean he only has like 8 billion dollars
is that all?
yeah
so he has to use budget actors
makes sense
boreddddddd
woah
dirty bomb has a new hero
sparks
medic chick?
she seems cool
is she available already?
yeah as of today
pretty cool looking
i wonder how her max change shot stacks up against vaseline
wut
?
max change shot/vaseline?
vasseli or however you spell his name
the sniper asshole
lol
oh
whom nobody likes
right
well her revive gun doesnt do damage does it?
it does
orly
it can 1-shot people
at full charge
o.O
well then that makes me more excited
there's an announcement video
it was on reddit a few days ago
gotcha
wat
free elite cases today?
wut
i just logged in
oh something went wrong
so they postponed it
aha
if you wanna see the video
it explains the charge mechanism
tanks
her med packs are also instant
unlike sawbonez
wow she's like a super skill class
lol
she definitely requires you to be good at aiming
yeah
and timing
overheating the gun and all
i dont think overheating will be a big issue
doesnt take much to get the feel of the timing
oh good
bushwanker's turret was nerfed
yay
min revive health was reduced
and it takes a sec to get up after being revived
so both medics and bushwankers were nerfed
sweet
yeah, revive spam was fun but definitely needed nerfed
definitely
team full of auras was nearly unkillable
same with teams full of wankers
too bad they didnt remove vaseline from the free rotation
lol
because I HATE HIM
kira was also nerfed
her ammo station has less health and the orbital strike has a 5 second longer cooldown
that's nice
some people were really good with those lasers
ammo station wasnt that OP
yeah
I liked how it gave me ammo even from enemies anyway
the health thing also heals enemies
but to a max of 75% health
yeah
that should be changed
I thik
*think
i kinda like that
because you can always just reclaim it if you need to move
well you should have to reclaim it if you need to move
75% isn't as good
it should be like 85% or something
if you're both in a firefight inside it, it really feels like you don't get any health from it and the enemy does
I didnt realize sawbone's health packs stopped if you took damage
maybe thats why I didnt like them
neither did I
that's interesting
hi
hi
hi
hi
hi
o/
also, c-c-c-c-combo breaker
hi
lol hi
hai
hi
wassap
so tony
yis
i'm level 12 or something now in Tera
oh fuck i haven't been playing
lol
I wasnt sure if you were or not
arching is kinda boring
I can kill everything without getting touched
"boring"
beastmode dude
altis life anyone?
lol
if not i'm hopping on tera
i may do that as well
ok tera time
ooh
reus
gonna play my main
yello
green
so I was just a Jasons Deli
ihad an ice cream cone
and I had some left over broccoli and cheese soup
so naturally I tried dipping my ice cream in it
as anyone would
and it was actually pretty good
wow, you were a jason's deli?
that's impressive
other than that I have to say that is an odd combination
yeah man
it's difficult being an entire building
tough life
wat is everyone doing?
i am playing solitaire
lol
I am eating delicious garlic-cheese sourdough bread with garlic dipping oil and seasoning
needs some chocolate and vanilla soft-serve on it
yum #1 breakfast NA
Brandon
ian
I am reacquring us equipment
for our detective
operation
i requre a dark fedora
What happened to your fedora you already had?
oh
i thought you meant on a new server or something
also can you join the server so I can have you inserted into the gang?
gangs are illegal
i stand for the law
that way we don't lose each other
being in a gang is not illegal
i aint no thug
check da rules
its not illegal
the groups are for tracking each other
you get the hexagons
but im watching game of thrones
well
okay
after the episode then
the episode is quite scandalous
so much nudity
im not on the newest
i'm on episode 7 i think
I just described all of game of thrones so it doesnt really matter lol
no nudity yet
ah
well
enjoy
lol
It's quite the "watch"
if you get my meaning
no you do not dip icecream in brocolli and cheese soup
you stoner stomach sonuvagun
it was good
some day I will make a super high end resturaunt
where the entire menu is just me combining random crap
and call it gormet
and charge a lot of money
and it will be really successful
I really shouldnt multi-task while watching GoT...
I think I may have seen this episode before
but I dont remember it very well
I got us a Mk.20 combat rifle and some mags
plus new vehicles
woo
nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
what the fuck
GoT why
George why do you do this
why do I watch this piece of crap show
lol he saw the thing
i saw the thing
do you watch GoT?
no but i know what happens
it's BS
that's what it is
this show is stupid
i think it may actually be genuine bs
i don't think that thing was in the books
could be wrong though
well
it was dumb
i dont even know why I watch it
almost all of the characters I like have died
Off the top of my head I can only think of one character that I like who isn't dead or maimed in some horrible way
"On the next GoT episode...."
fallout is on sale
I could get fallout 1,2,3, and NV...
but is it worth it?
maybe...
I mostly hear people talk about fallout 3/NV
so idk if i should buy 1/2
also idk if I want to spend the time required to play them
did assassin's creed just like...pump out 4 games while I wasn't looking?
there's a new ass creed every other week
seriously
it's because they are all the same
just reskinned
with maybe one new mechanic added every other release
hm
the series might as well be called assassins greed
i did love black flag though
that one I was seriously invested in
if they ever do a feudal china one I may get that
i got bored of it like 1/2 way through and stopped playing
lol
black flag I beasted through and became a terror of the seas
it was boring imo :F
OH DAYUM the new updated screen
?
for the monster clicker
lol
using the script?
the script changes the game skin
yeah
that's nuts
love the golden gaben
have you been following the script at all?
nope
the strategy for it has changed
only buy health
ONLY buy health?
really?
and for items, get wormholes
yeah
well i fucked up
every level divisible by 500 they stop clicking and just spam wormholes
because each wormhole = jump 10 levels if it is dibisible by 500
nice
and you dont want to do high damage so the level lasts as long as possible
they reached level 100m
that's the max
if i join a new game will it reset my item badge currency
to buy wormholes?
yeah
ok I'm getting new vegas
your item currency wont come back
but you'll keep the items you bought previously
hm
and any money you earned since
ok buy ONLY health?!
yes
sec
well
whats the highest level room you have gotten to?
how can i check
game main screen
oh
i was gonna say you could join a pre-existing game listed on http://www.steamga.me
lol but?
but you can only join if it is within 10 levels if your max
yeah holy fuck
and they are all jumping like 500 levels per second
i have no idea how you people
oy
I joined my room right when it opened
the server i join may just be nincompoops :<
I'm in 47092
and my room is doing terribly
yeah i can't join yo urs
we have trolls
ah
people nuking the 500 bosses
constantly
this is the last day for the game i believe
so only ahaaaaaah
so only armor?
buy 10 health then move to the next tier
they're trying to get everyone to 100m today
once the top rooms reach it they are going to trickle down to lower rooms to help them
that's charitable of them
my room is only at like 600k :(
they took my items away
the hell
i no longer have
did your money come back?
my raining gold stuff
no
weird
i switched rooms this morning
and kept my stuff
yesterday it was different, if you switched rooms you just got all your money back
well, my room is progressing at the 8th fastest rate
of all open rooms right now
between 1-2 thousand per minute
top room is doing 92k levels per minute
lol
ok cool got it all back
....switched again lol
.....health only? nothing on click damage?
i'm using the auto buy script
but as far as I know for the first few million levels all you do is health
huh
. . .
um
the script took away my wormhold ._.
how many wormholes did you have?
it automatically uses them
and spams them until level 100k
.....1
oh
I had 30,000
lol
god damn son
i hear they added a level 100m badge
so now I have to reach level 100m
this game is getting buggy
i refreshed and it froze
buggy how?
and previously it grayed out items that i coudl buy
sometimes refreshing doesnt work
and when i did it didn't indicate  levellng up
that isnt a bug
it greys out stuff you shouldnt buy
or shouldnt use
oh
it grayed out health?
oh, that was probably just because you didnt have enough money
no i had more than enough
it may have dysync'd
sometimes you buy stuff, then your client thinks you didnt
it fixes itself after a minute
it took away all my purchases....all my upgrades
-_-
idk wat ur doin
mine isnt buggy
lol
mine's ust having seizures i guesss
i just have mine running on my desktop at home
while I'm at work
hoping it reaches 100m
it's an official server relatively high on the list so it should get trickle down support
which room # are you in?
apparently voat.co got shut down
lol my god
uh
yeah :/ for no good reason
47283 room #
for the first million LEVELs only get health?
where do you reaed this strategy?
it's just what people are doing
hm
h'okay
oh hmm
read what the mods say on that stream
the dev of the script also hangs out there
doing DPS doesnt help
oh my god there's no freakin
like nothing on screen lol
because once you get to like level 1m, doing more dps isnt really helpful
they have so much health that the only way to kill them is with abilities
so you're better off just having tons of health so that the high level bosses cant 1-shot you
ahah
what the hell
there are services that let you pay for prayers
._.
and originate is working on one such project apparently
or considering working on one
idk exactly what the context of this spreadsheet is
....?
?
?
!
...
There's gonna be a merc added to DB called turtle
apparently
and he can deploy walls
lol
turtle
I hope he has a hard hat
huh
apparently intelligence is highly correlated with good looks
I knew we were all sexy mofos
that sounds like a buzzfeed article
surprisingly not
well
hm
lemme dissect this
how does one quantify attractiveness
is there a mathematical formula or is it subjective perception? or straight up symmetry?
it is subjective
also people may find intelligence itself to be attractive
how do they measure it in thi ahah
they may as well say people with symmetrical features are more attractive than those who are asymetrical
"Teachers were asked to describe the children physically"
(nao that's very true)
yes, because symetry is a desirable trait
yeah
just like intelligence
so
anyways before we get off tangent
teachers rating attractiveness of students
flawed quantifier
probably a bias towards the intelligent ones anyway
yes
there are so many uncontrolled variables in this study
i just imagine people regarded as more symmetrical are treated better and they have less psychological damage that would otherwise inhibit mental development
but that's still entirely a cultural thing
someone considered beautiful in India may be considered ugly here
true
But isn't symmetry a universally desired trait?
probably, but that's just one trait
and what about the other extreme where someone is so ugly they become a recluse and focus themselves on learning
or distracting themselves from the rest of the world with science
or whatever they want to learn about
well
Tesla was said to be a lady killer but had no interest in sex
he had a thing for pidgeons though
that he did
but the ladies / world found him attractive
i hear he had balls of lightning
lol
coils*
he had balls of lightning too
supposedly, at least
oyis
i dont think anyone ever really saw them
he kept his balls private
but yeah, it angers me when I see articles making broad claims like that, that aren't properly backed by science
that's why people consider psychology to be a pseudo-science
o_O
Google Music recommended justin beiber for me
oh hey they changed the "havingfun at work" icon on Google Music
it no longer looks like someone hanging theirself
lol
shame
2.5Trillion for the next armor upgrade
level 1062
i wonder how I'm doing
I can't check my money or upgrades from work
the top room is almost half way to 100m
my room is in 13th place
nice son
top room is 9x farther than mine lol
and we're about to get passed by #14
lol
Valve seems to be totally ok with people using the script
the original top badge was level 300k
every day they just bump it one step farther than the script could obtain the previous day
lol
valve seems to be aware and promoting it
it's still a great community event and a great way to advertise valve
they should just say like "reach level 1 trillion for half life 3"
O.O
HELL NAW
lol
could you imagine
we'd do it
we would
idk how but they made their script 10x faster today than it was yesterday
wat
for the order!
AGATHAAAAAA
so you're caught up on GoT now?
yeah :/
lol
shh
meister hasnt seen it yet
holy jesus
#14 REALLY passed us
they did a 2 million level jump just now
how the fuck
all those wormholes
yeah
they stalled on a boss and got to use a TON I guess
they nuked a boss on mine
we only jumped 70 levels lol
lol
the script only does huge jumps on every boss that is divisible by 500
so as long as the nukes arent on those it isnt bad
the script also has some sort of anti-troll feature
for the people who run script specifically to nuke bosses
I dont know how it works
nice!
do you have terrarrarararararaia tony?
no
you should get it when it goes back on sale and terraria with us after the new update comes out
what' sin teh new update
tons of stuff
what makes it not minecraft 2d or starcraft on land
i think you mean starbound
starbound is a terraria rip off
so ignore it
and terraria is nothing like minecraft
other than having voxel based terrain
so there you have it
#_#
it's fun
maybe
and its like $2.50 or something
ehhhh maybe
eeeets fuuuun
just ask andrew
he can verify
i'd probably only play for the social aspect
well that's half the reason for playing
but it's fun getting loot and fighting bosses
wait
"in library"
welp
lol
gg
0 hours
got it last steam sale
haha
yup 6/21/14
I had a dream I checked my youtube earnings and had like $100 dollars
I just checked
I have $0.49
oh wait I actually have just under $4
so apparently that other DB gamemode is playable now
lol
DB?
ohhh yeah
and in other news space engineers made a blog post about planets
and it looks like planets will be cool
people are napalming bosses -_-
...health for the first million or first thousand?
so weird
health always
never damage
you really need the whole room to be doing the strategy though
5.4 trillion fo rnext one
ah
well
doubtful on this one
lol
the Ye Olde Wormhole room started 2 hours late
to avoid the randoms and trolls
and has already blown past all the Reddit rooms
it was at 60m last I saw
apparently a ton of the people who got 100m yesterday are now trolling
so that nobody else gets the badge
they want the 100m badge to be rare apparently
oh my god
so they bought like 300k cooldown resets
and are just nuking like crazy
-_-
sounds about right
they can nuke like 1 nuke every few seconds
all day
with that many cooldown resets
le sigh
if YOWH starts a new room I'll probably abandon mine and hop on theirs
oh wow, YOWH #1 is already at 80m
that was like 20m in.. 20 minutes
how do you join these rooms srsly
in the screen before the actual game
i want on the gravy train
where it has the join friends thing
JoinGame(roomID) in console
but it has to have room and cant be more than 10 levels past your record
i'm boned
and if you leave a room you can't rejoin it
ugh
my room has been stuck on 7m for hours
:/
yeah, you're clearly in a room full of randoms lol
yeah
they extended the game
till the 22nd
i'm fucked
ah
games reset at 9am
is there a resource wher eyou're getting this? just the twitch channel?
you gotta get in an official room at 9am
-_-
various sources
h
m
meta game
find the best guides/teams to play the best match
i'm in the steam group, i check in on twitch sometimes
and I watch the leaderboards on steamga.me
and I read the update notes on github
lol
(I am so bored at work I have nothing better to do)
-_- how nice that must be
it's boring
the day goes by so slow
take a look at #1
well, the top 2 rooms
they arent doing many clicks
compared to other rooms
wow
it's all about WH spam
T_T
wow 47365 just jumped 1.2 million levels
tfw you join rooms where people think 10k is nuts
lol
10k was nuts
like
i wanna ragequit
4 or 5 days ago
dont quit
just raise your max level
and keep an ear out for new rooms opening with the script
ear out?
then hop on those
does the script ping me?
no
does twitch indicate new rooms?
twitch chat usually does, yeah
wont be until twitch rooms reach 100m though
other groups like YOWH might do it sooner
YOWH has a steam group
89milion god damn
is the YOWH chat
of course reddit/twitch rooms are also worth joining if new ones open
because even if you only get to like 5m, that will make joining games easier
and get you more wormholes for tomorrow
must find out how to join early room
joining is finnicky
you'll get lots of ERROR 400 messages
because the servers get slammed with join requests
you just spam it until it says error: room is full
and refresh
and hopefully you actually got in
oh also
are you good at hackey sack?
no why
i need to get better at it
do your people play it a lot
yes
every day
multiple times
they try to get a "hack" where it goes around and everyone hits it at least once
whenever I participate getting a hack takes seriously like 50x longer
lol
I kind of...
you could say,,,
drop the ball
90m
terrarrererereara is awesome
i'm not gonna hit level 5k at this rate
expected jump: 0
we have no wormholes lol
rando-room
i just joined your room because mine wasnt moving at all
shame there's not liek a queu or something
bad idea D:
i have 19k wormholes
lol
my max is 22m
my room wasnt gonna pass that
-_-
so no reason to stay
since this room is going so slow and it's obviously not going to hit 100m, there's no harm in buying DPS stuff
k
oh, YOWH is going to announce another room soon
where
room 3 and possibly 4
this chat is hard to follow
yes
room 3 huh
followewd by room 4 5 minutes after
which i cn't join >_<
?
it's a million level sup
room 3 doesnt exist yet
oh
go to http://steamcommunity.com/minigame/
open console (ctrl shift j)
and be ready to use JoinGame(roomID)
no room id announced yet ?
not yet
watch the irc
will they make like a large announcement?
they will probably just say what the room id is
they just muted the channel
so it wont be as spammy
nice
lol all the trolls are quitting
yeah lol
even unmuted this is better than twitch chat
yehhhh
Kappa Kappa Kappa 420
tq4help nobsid <3
they need to hurry up an annouce the room id :F
yeh
i think they are waiting for YOWH 1 to reach 100m
same
gydot speaking made me think as much
4.6m to go
the YOWH rooms should be slightly easier to get in to than the reddit/twitch rooms
since it's a smaller following
yeah
god it's moving at an absolute crawl
lol
yeah
ooh small activity
oh nice lol
i got 2
lol same
.. i want 1
room 4 it is
2 is probably gonna be easier to get in to
er yes 4
ok it slowed a lot
like
they were jumping insanely
yeah
y cant we start now
like right meow
save an hour
lol pms
what does /hype do
idk
lol well dont' do it
he probably just means spamming chat with hype spam
lmao
that didnt last long
lol
"everyone shut the fuck up" is the winning vote
yup
lol
half the chat spam was "mute pls" anyways
3.7m to go....
i kinda was planning on leaving work a bit early
now i have to sit around for this
i'm sure you'll make it
the things I do for useless internet points
srsly
4.4mil to go
i think you'll be fine
3.4
2.9
they probably have enough wormholes left to just spam them on any random level and reach 100m
i may just use rume 3
if i have to wait 5 freakin minutes
5 whole minutes!
man they keep failing to land on a good jump level
yeah
looks like they might do a big jump
just jumped 1.666 mil
another big jump incoming
0.6m to gooooo
incoming
those wormholes
aaaannnd I have to pee
gonna be a sec
oh they justmuted
o_o
this is steam ralted
?
room #3 will never happen!
wat
3!!
dont you see!
no
THREE
OH
lol
HL 3, portal 3, left4dead 3, team fortress 3!
lel
lol dammit
room 4 due to birth year
that was directed at those in room 1
oh
room 4 ftw then?
honestly i'd say just try to join 3 and if you cant then join 4
getting in is hard
yeah i'll do that
lolwtf
10minbreak
ughhh 10 minute break after hitting 100m
wat
HAH
ok told you
drive home bruh
I totally could have gone home
it takes me 30 minutes
T_T
and now traffic will be bad
cuz 5pm friday
watch you'll get a raise from staying late on a friday
look at that brandon
lol
such a hard worker
on a friday no less
i do have a lot of text streaming along my screen
to the untrained eye it could look like work
lol
multiwindows
loads of text
resources for counters and scripts
yes
work
lots of numbers
i also have my mc code in the background
lol
99.9
im gonna go pee
brb
back
this calls for a snack
looks like they got it
yup
5 minutes until room id is announced
23:18
so, when they announce the new room id
it's JoinGame(id)
<<< 
yes
it'll open a popup
ctrl shift j
oh wait
click ok to leave current game, then click ok on whatever error message you get
and keep doing that
until it says error: room is full
as fast as you can
so in my current game?
in the lobby before the game screen
Hi all
hi
ok so i'll have to leave that game
hi
yes
ids up
47686
in
i got in first try
lol same
nice
muuuch easier than reddit/twitch
i could only get one wormhole :<
doesnt matter, we'll have more than enough
they have a different script
ok that is brilliant
wait it does EVERYTHING?!
LIKE
ARMORS UP FOR ME
WHAT
yes
it takes care of everything
lol room 4 announced immediately as well
coo
gonna make a bank run lol
i like the wormhole animation at the bottom
same
good way to notify you're still running
troll tracking
nice
i think we'll pass your old max level in about.... 10 minutes or less
lol
probably 5 or less
yeah
we're already like
yeah
yeah
nonsense
perfect timing too
i have things to do >_< lol
lol
leave the tab in focus though
now how do i make sure my comp doesn't go to sleep
like you can do other stuff but leave chrome not minimized with the game tab selected
yeah
control panel -> power options
we already beat my last level
lol
oh it even ups levels
YUP
beat
beat the shit out of
old room fail
lol
programming is amazing and horrifying
1435 of 1500 people in the room are using the script
damn son
who the f isn't lol
145k already lol
3 is already a leaderboard
and 4
turn off display...should be safe yes
like
yes
i dont' wanna risk it lol
lke god forbid
welp
imma go home now
lol
ok lol
ttyl
these are freaking great
so fellas
whats crackin
not much
you
I'm out of town tomorrow till tuesday
eating panda expressss
lol oh my god that trump video
the spit
100% reminds me of my chem teacher in high school
he always had spit on his lip
you know, he could pay for a presidential campaign completely out of pocket, and it'd only cost about 25% of his net worth
it's a good thing we got in room 3, tony
it's 20m ahead of 4
woo i made a texture for the reinforced leather
lemme see :F
Looks nice
it is subject to change still
but its better than a black x
im gonna work on the base armor 3d model now
I'd move the reinforced parts (the silver/gray) inside by one pixel block (4 pixels?) because of the way it interacts with stack numbers
just 1 pixel if you're doing 16x
looks good though
i also looked up how hardened leather is made
apparently you just dip it in hot water
lol
dip*
I was trying to make it like a folded towel shape, kinda like a sleeping bag with studded parts
lol
wow
that's not what I was thinking of then
so maybe in the future i'll change how its made
so you have to like toss it in a cauldron
actually maybe I should just do that now
because that sounds like a fun way to make it
lol
leather is often hardened with water treatments
so that makes sense
might be too cheap though
I'd make it so that you have to do two steps, one with the leather to make it hardened, then stud it with iron bars (4 probably) in a crafting bench
currently its a 6 to 1 leather to reinfoced leather conversion
i dont want to make it studded :F
because the armor isnt going to be studded
well then whats with the things that look like studs
lol
thats thread
aha
well then
you could make it a two step process still, with string crafting the second part
I could make hardened leather be a thing, then use it to craft reinforced leather.. but that just sounds tedious
well shouldnt it feel like a process?
it should feel like a meaningful process
you're making an indestructable piece of armor that will hopefully be in your life for the duration of your minecrafting
i could make like a drying or tanning rack
and balance it by making it take time
time is abundant though
just think of terrafirmacraft, getting something truly useful took a process, and you felt super gratified when it was done
so thats not much balance
TFC made things take time, resources, and made you pay attention to heat levels and stuff
this doesn't have to be that complex
but higher level crafting for like armor plates could be
I think tossing 6 leather into a cauldron (with heat under it) would be a good way to make it
well, all I know is I really want to involve a cauldron
lol
yeah
that'd be a great way to do it
make it take a minute or two
in reality you only leave it in the water for like 10 seconds
really?
well then make it realistic
and you have to be quick, if you do it too long it can get messed up
if you do it for too long you get tough leather that can't be used for anything but crafting back into normal leather via furnace
eh, that's just an annoyance then
lol
it's hardmode yo
so i assume i can probably just tick leather and see if its sitting in a cauldron with fire underneath it
although
dont items bounce out of cauldrons?
they do bounce
yup
thats annoying
yeah
thaum does it by turning a cauldron into a hopperesque new block
with an inventory
yeaaahhhhhh i dont want to make my own cauldron though
yeah
because the existing cauldron needs more purpose
why not just start with a water bucket, four string, and four leather in a crafting bench
I could make it just look for the leather to be in a water block with fire nearby underneath it
so you could style it to look like whatever you want
that seems kinda derp tho
or I could not be lazy and modify the cauldron to hold items and have them float in the water and be all cool and stuff
but
I have no clue how to do that
lol
GAH
there's a thing that goes along with Forge called Cauldron
so googling stuff about the block is hard
lol
i can detect when you right click a cauldron with leather in your hand
that'd probably work
so if i can store arbitrary nbt data on the cauldron (i.e. how many leather it has in it) and hook into its tick event to detect if it has > 6 and fire under it, then I can make it work
it just wont really have any sort of visual indicator of progress
couldnt you also use it's tick to check for one or more leather, and put that many rendered entities (not pick-up able) just above the cauldron?
probably, but that isnt very precise
that'd at least give some visual queue
it would show like 1,2,3, and maybe 4, but beyond that i dont think the stack really indicates amount
that'd be fine
it's just other than that, how do you know if it has ANY in it?
actually stacks either show 1 item or 2
they show 3 items at 16
lol
well
if I can render an item above it I can probably render text
and only show it if you are looking at it
well there you have it
a plan at least
lol
anywho, i'm off to bed
ok
night
gotta take alex to a fucking meeting at 8am tomorrow for half an hour, about 15 minutes away from the apartment :F
lol
holy shit they did it
I wonder when they actually reached 100m
a bunch of rooms failed just a few million short of reaching 100m
the steam encore sale started
I bought Darkest Dungeon and Fallout NV
lol
it was like at 3:30 or so
maybe 3
we got some big jumps then
when I went to bed it looked like we were only going to just barely make it to 100m before 9 am
lol
welp it's happened
someone already likened a political candidate to hitler
lol
I bought darkest dungeon and windward
windward was nine bucks
pretty good deal
I discovered that my plan to use the vanilla cauldron isnt easily possible andrew
because the vanilla cauldron isnt a tile entity
oh really
wow
so imma just make a leather rack item that you place on top of a cauldron
lol
lol
it'll just be like a bar that goes across and leather will hang from it
oh nao
how do cauldrons store water then?
i told people about GearUp
meta data
ah
they're very interested in it
who'd you tell? lol
some wilds
well, I'm gonna try to make the leather rack thingy today
they told me to tell you about another mod
and maybe start on the armor this weekend at some point too
where it like
repaired components to gradually level thigns up
tinkers construct/iguana tweaks?
i thnk tinkers
iguana tweaks is an addon for tinkers that allows you to level tools up
lol
hmmm h1z1
the game looked kinda boring from the streams I saw when it was first released
it'll be f2p at some point anyways
hm
yeah
oh
32 max players per serverok
wat seriously?
32 per server?
reading reviews
the game is supposed to have like 10,000 per server
"Non-exhaustive issue list:
Not massively-multiplayer: It's supposed to be an open-world, massively-multiplayer space sim, however it is actually limited to 32 players. In addition to the hard player caps in place, there are multiple conflicting game modes which only spreads people out even more (Open Mode, Solo Mode, and Private Mode (solo with friends)). I understand many people like to play Solo, but I got this game under the pretext that it would be massively-multiplayer."
and the map is supposed to be HUGE
that's like
stupid
they built it on the PS2 engine specifically to support thousands of players on a single server
if they can only handle 32 then there is something massively wrong with the game
that was one review mind you
could be a blatant lie but i dunno
prison architect for $5
it's definitely capped, and it definitely looks boring
it's like dayz with less zombies and more three year olds
and the art is all so dark and monotone
yeah
it should have been 10000x better
ffVII
.....hmmmmmmmmm
oh do you guys have a spreadsheet of the armor / gear components?
i have a google doc
1 sec
oh hmmm
there's a legs and boots
roit
got any arm gearups yet?
well, there is no arm armor
awww
that's so dumb
but ok
what arm upgrades did you have in mind?
servos to increase your punch action (mine/chop/stuff faster)
blades to increase melee damage
honestly it seems like speed/strength is th only realy variable...
when clicking
maybe heat-resistance
i think heat resistance is already on the list somewhere
say pulling refined ore from a forge grants you a 2% increase
or something
like you get to the back of the furnace
well, I might add some tools to the mod later
and those could deal with arm stuff
cool
I think steam just went down
their chat client did at least
the goal is for it to be like highly personalized gear. Like EDC sort of stuff
little gadgets or tweaks that give you an edge at a particular task
gotcha
are you taking suggestions or you got a good grasph onit?
suggestions are always welcome
are you going to have like radio beacons with communications?
no
I'd suggest a Helmet Antenna for improved range/clarity
ok pass
it's low-tech themed
steampunky?
sorta
I think it'd be cool to make a pvp mod for minecraft - more balanced weapons, radio beacons and stuff hooked up to mumble or ventrilo or something like that, some kind of goal, stores for items, weapons, ridable things like horses and stuff. would make a nice server
ugh
BSOD
gg
anyways
the mod is meant to keep to the vanilla feel
it'll be balanced against vanilla
brandog you should buy borderlands 2 with me so we can all play
i have bd3
derp
lol
i know :3
I have it for xbox, and it was fun while i had someone here to play with
how much is it?
like 5 bucks
I have $10 in quarters sitting here
so why not
GOTY is 8
includes all the dlc
unable to log in to steam
ahhhhh
hm
I should really fix my RAM
yeah their servers are having trouble
so I stop getting BSODs
what's wrong with it?
i mean
my
wAAAAm
when I use too much ram I get a BSOD
You need more dide-tat-ed waaaam?
ah, so you probably have a dead stick
bad sector on one of them
oh just a sector?
that's not horribad
I doubt the entire stick is bad
not that that matters
my cousin was lucky enough to have an entirely bad stick
lol
if any part of the stick is bad I have to replace the entire stick
there are ways to work around a bad sector
but it's easier to just replace it
yeah
lol
anyway, I bought it :3
I'll buy it whenever steam decides to authenticate my login
so we can play when I get back from graeagle - next monday :P
stupid steam sale either happens WHILE i'm there or right before, so i never get to play my games right away :F
lol
I cant find the exact ram I bought a year ago
what'd you buy
but I dont want mismatched sticks
just buy a two pack and replace two of your sticks
two and two is fine, at least it's symmetrical
it'd be 2 and 1
i only have 2 currently
oh
2x8
gotcha
Well then it's not that bad to just replace both
it's a waste
but not THAT much waste
lol
$100 to get a new 2x8
eww really?
yeah
I got mine for like 50 bucks
my ram was $160 a year ago
no longer available now
o.O
why so spensive?
oh hey
it has a lifetime warranty
it's good ram
well there ya go
lol
dealing with warranty stuff is such a pain though
bad sector good enough for a warranty replacement?
it really is
I crushed one of my skullcandy earbuds
but don't want to have to send them in for a new pair
so I taped it up and i'm just using one of the buds currently :F
lol
well, I found 2 sticks on a website
but they cost $222
lol
dayum
i found a good looking 2x8 corsair pair
it would match my case
but it is $200 :(
lol
so much monet
so many monets
that was intended, believe it or not
lol
I tried searching "too much monet" but google just corrected me :(
why is ram so spensive
yeah idk, that's odd because my ram was super duper cheap
and why do all these ram sticks look like transformers
lol
bceause they have to be able to respond quickly to random access in both car and robot form
they look like decepticons
okay, tank and robot form
this one looks niceeeeee
it really does
so smooth
and not as jagged as like 99% of the market
yeah
and not red or blue
lol
red vs blue
I miss that show
I should really save my money though
and just use my warranty
probably
so I gave a student 0.5/30 on this last assignment
gg
they turned in two files out of five, and had zero of the components required for the assignment
I had to really struggle with not giving them a zero
so I'm in one of the new YOWH steam monster game rooms
we've been building up a wormhole jump for 5 minutes now
lol
im done with wormholes @_@
gotta help out those who havent gotten 100m yet!
why does it matter?
lol
to get the 100m badge
ah
do you get money for these things?
and because it is fun
no
good, then i don't feel that bad about not participating :P
7 minute build up
this is gonna be good
jumping from level 594000
jumped to 1,248,143
lol
died instantly upon arrival
lol
steam is really struggling to handle this
oh yay it let me log in now
bought BL2 GOTY
woo
may be able to play a tiny bit today
still grading for now though
plus i got four hours of sleep last night so i'll probably take a nap
oh also, fallout shelter is fucking addicting
I cannot wait til it comes out on android
oh the summer game does actually unlock new sales every day
at least it used to
now that we're on encore sales it doesnt
so you should feel bad for not contributing to the cause!
the sales it unlocked were crappy
lol
and it's not that I didn't contribute
I played
just not with the script
hey, i almost bought one of those sales!
I DID buy one
lol
it was crap
lol
but it was 2.50 worth of crap, with some promise and regular updates
so maybe in a few years it'll be a game
it's an investment
exactly
Honestly I wish I was on the dev team
I could fix like 90% of the problems right off if they aren't two year olds writing code and if their engine isnt the worst ever
we just jumped 2 million levels
their biggest problem is the control scheme is shit
it was pretty obviously developed with mobile platforms in mind
and then they just scrapped it or something
wow my room just jumped 3 million levels
jesus the main YOWH group just jumped 10m levels
lawl
dat jump
lmao
from the YOWH group: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGOmsn7vK8c
fucking lol
what room
48520?
phew, finally done grading
now time for food :F
nao
what room
10k badge points what th fuck
wait on my sever...room
YOWHers: 1
guys
game?
no one?
hi
i was at movie
good movie?
yes
wat movie
I'm in YOWH #3
San Andreas
ah
the YOWHers thing isnt accurate btw
olol
well
it says theres only 186 in my room
aah
oh yeah i am in 4 i thnk
#3 didnt do very well while I was gone
well i was
we jumped 20m earlier
shortly before I left for the movies
only went up about 8m since though
oh no i'm not
whateves i did it
#3 is making a big jump though
14 minute charge so far
"18. My dad called me a Twat because I opened a new tab."
lol
game
game?
what game?
dunno
db or altis?
if not i got others but I'm always trying to do a group game NOT on a weekday night after 10pm -_-
for altis to work we need deco
he has the gear and he actually knows how to play altis
and navigate that island
so
we can do DB
were you down?
were others down?
possibly bl2?
well i do believe andrew and deco are out of town
@_@ gurk
lol
h'okay
if not, andrew is leaving soon
you have a pref?
db
h'okay
Brandon Worl
Anthony Humphreys
Brandon Worl
Anthony Humphreys
darkest dungeon is a freaking hard game
that's kinda the point
they actually patched the game about a month ago to make it harder
people already thought it was 2d turn based dark souls
well all of my people died
lol
3 times
tony here?
nope
well
wanna play somethin in a bit?
im moddin
i'm just packing up a bit and then i'm free for a couple hours
I cant get this stupid thing to extend the vanilla block class
YOWH #3 charged a wormhole jump for an entire hour
got around 20 million levels out of it
wow
can you just do that? extend a vanilla block?
block is a class
it's just a generic class representing a block
oh gotcha
so then you HAVE to extend it to make your own?
yes
makes sense
it's probably giving you an error saying "your scala is not wordy enough to extend this java class"
where the hell is "soundTypeStone" coming from....
it's the sound type that plays when you walk on it
yes
but where does it come from
main.basemod.blocks or net.minecraft.block.material.Material
nope
importing those doesn't do it
well then
is that mod in scala?
no
it's not part of blockbase
?
there is nothing anywhere in that repo that creates "soundTypeStone"
so it has to be from a package somewhere
but none of the packages imported in that file seem to include it
it's from block
but importing that doesn't define it
Block.soundTypeStone
and doing Block.soundTypeStone also doesnt work
try importing net.minecraft.block.Block?
or ItemBlock
nah not that
probably the first one
oh hey it worked that time
lol
lol
I swear I tried that already
probably forgot to spell it meinkraft
as soon as you start hitlering your code it whips itself into shape
lol
I'm learning how to use Techne now
to make the cauldron hanger model
noice
techne seems tedious to work with
easier to blender and convert?
probably not
techne might have keybinds that make this stuff easier that I dont know about
it's nothing obvious if it does have them though
interesting
you should take a break and borderlands or DB with me
but I only started this like an hour ago
but you have all week :F
but I am busy during the week
But I am gone all week
but i am in the mood to get stuff done
:F
reached 100m again! :D
dear god
windward is exactly what I was expecting
I love it
lol
and now i have to leave it for a week :(
I should have the cauldron hanger 3d model working within an hour :D
when you get back in a week maybe my mod will have some actual features implemented
lol that'd be sweet
i'll be on thursday to check on the grading stuff i have to do
I expect a piece of armor by then
I'll see what I can do :p
lol, gnight
night
o_O
I have been trying to figure out why my block model isnt rendering
I just happen to look up in game just now
it IS rendering
REALLY HUGE
in the sky
haha
figure out why?
i got the scale fixed
position and rotation are still off
sounds like your modeling program is a bit wonky
you'd think they would set that stuff for you automagically if it's a MC specific program
scale was my fault I think
rotation I have no clue
I'll probably change the model a bit
but it renders!
looks nice
tanks
can you make leather hang from it?
it'll render whatever item is hanging on it
yes
not yet
awesome
but soon
lol
however
i must go to costco
soon*tm*
soon! today! if all goes well
hehe
well good luck
i'm heading out
ok
have fun
just had to grade one more student :F
lol
live long and make the force be ever in your favor
lol
imma steal that line
haha
oh my god
love that
lol, one of the reddit rooms reached level 98 million last night
and then the game ended
RIP in peace
only ~40k people got the 100m badge
fewer if you account for people who got to 100m multiple times
vgh
The previous night I got to 98 million :(
o well lol
some people in reddit said they were in both rooms that stopped at 98m on the last 2 days of the event
talk about bad luck
greetings folks

ching chong china
also I hate utah
coming home tomorrow
lol
a still more glorious dawn awaits. not a sunrise, but a galaxy rise. a morning filled with 400-billion suns; the rising of the milky way.
Tyson said that in Cosmos
made me all happy
calling him Tyson seems so weird to me
black science man
you either say his whole name or call him
yeah
that
XD
The Grassy Tyson
or we can call him Neil
lots of cool people are called neal
neal?
children are freaking terrifying
can't stand that narrator
lol
hrnnng

no games?
see what is this
no altis
no db
no nazzing

mjolnir armor on a bike
waddafak
i am playing a 3d version of 
it just said game over
the game was clearly not over
I was at 512 and had plenty of moves available
3d
game over

lol
so BB has a new album
is it good?
i think so
it's on spotify
i saw it on google music
didnt listen though
not bad
nothing that ripped my soul out yet
well i guess thats good
Breaking the Silence came close
this is one glitchy-ass  game
jfjaksjfkajsf
i was like 10 moves away from winning
and it was all like "game over"
why do you keep playing it?
surely there are clones
because
it is like extra challenge
SOOOOOOOOOOOO
hi folks
back in Vegas
ohai
how was ohai-oh
You mean Utah?
Ian
Ian
sure that one
wrong button
So
so how was arizona?
I spent the last 90 miles with no air
due to my radiator water pump leaking
I had to stop
....blech
and fill the radiator
it was 110 in Ash Springs, NV
just stick an egg in it
The radiator is fine
Its the seal in the pump
duct tape
IN the pump
INSIDE it
get creative with the duct tape
Its hotter than boiling water
how is problem
you see vladmir
we can clear clogs in veins of living people, surely you can fix a leak in a tube
you make pipe of duct tape
so inside and outside fix self
The car is Korean
not russian
Russian car never break
you see Vladmir
damn foreign cars!
only need more tape
gotta go with that all 'murican car
you see John
$$$$
you see Xin Xioaja
You see Hanz
Der Judes
so how was Iowa?
Wow
These other state jokes are getting... corny
like Iowa
so how was Maine?

it's oddly fitting
it just goes to show that everything exists on the internet
Hi
hi
I took my car to the shoppe
did they fix your thermal regulation device?
They are fixing the thermal regulation device's fluid input system.
I am off today though
lol
i came home early today
because I have nothing to do at work
We should play a game
how about
you cook me some tacos
I would
but I have no car
mmm damn
I really want tacos
and I had a martini
so I can't drive
was it shaken or stirred?
Shaken
good
It gets colder that way
well
im gonna grab a hot pocket or something
as a crappy taco substitute
okay
think of something that sounds fun
i was instructed not to eat
wat
because my mom might be bringing food home
but i am hungry
i only had 2 small sliders and fries for lunch
i cant find the stupid power cord for my piano keyboard
noooo
sup
i can't find the screws, power cord, or headphone adapter
your rollout one?
what did you do
my keyboard
too bad we cant look up deco on that
why not?
he is set to private
you own one more game than I do, tony
I am stealth
but i want to snoop on your steam stats
and see how many hours you have played arma
lol
you have played exactly one armadecohour
that unit makes your answer correct
262 human hours
my most played game on steam is terraria i believe
oh no it isnt
lol
space engineers is
followed my arma
then terraria
terraria is my lowest price/hour though
mine is war thunder
maybe
too bad we'll never know
because you are private
(note to self: install key logger on deco's computer)
its maybe followed by KSP
i bet your top game is like My Little Pony or something
and that's why you are set to private
Nah its cause I stalk people so I am paranoid
Also war thunder is adding a persistant mission mode
damn hippos has 270 hours logged on awesomenauts
with long term objectives
and scouting
and stuff
I own 92 games I have never played
wow
lol
that's 61% of my entire library
amazing
out of everyone I have looked up, that is by far the worst
I should really play these games I buy
you mean minecraft?
a lot of them are crap humble bundle games
true
yeah see thats the problem
I only play like 2 or 3 games
but I play them a lot
play war thunder a lot
and I cycle one out for another every few months/years
I should rewatch stargate atlantis
wats that
best show ever
uh huh
i've watched it end to end twice already
it's the only show I have ever rewatched
I don't watch shows really
it is the best
show
ever
what show
\o\ what do
nothing
db anyone
altis anyone
my gang got banned :(
I'll find us a new server
after dinner
brb
lol
i found my piano power cord and stuff
it was in my storage unit
aww banned? :<
the noirs?
i found everything except my headphone adapter
>_<
back
anyone here?
yis
WE GOT ONE
I would like to do something
but
I don't know where everyone is
I think you killed them
Tony, did you do it?
nnnnnmaybe
probably
dunno they like to hide until 10pm
Its true
From 6-10
poof
no one
6-10 is dinner/get all of your shit together time.
Hi Tony :D
I smell like Oranges :D
no
you probably smell like potatoes
That is why I was telling Tony and not you. :/
Now I want potatoes.
Hi Courtney!
Why oranges
Whats Courtney?
Whai?? New shampoo bottle.
oh snazzy
coincidentally drinking oj
I havnt had oj in a long time.
I had a Martini
Ian needs to start sharing those martini's.
Serious lack of martini up in here.
you probably don't even like martinis
Who doesn't like martinis?
People that like drinks with sweetener?
wat.
Martinis have no sugar?
so?
Some people dislike that
foos.
i just don't like alcohol
A lot of people don't
I assume that when Ian makes it, its not overwhelmingly alchohol.
90% its not
hello
OF COURSE
LOOKIT THAT
10PM
lol
time to shower and try to blaze the thursday through x_X
tah~
tah
i was watching tv
lol
and stuff
hence my afkness
hi
hi
I want non dairy chocolate milk
mostly so I can blow bubbles in it
lol wut
just a random craving
i am also hungry
I had pancakes and bacon for lunch
but I only ate half my pancakes
wat
I had a beef schwarma
i am bored
so I put eye drops in my eyes last night
which is impressive considering I have a deep rooted aversion to anything touching my eyes
but now my eyes feel so fresh
it's amazing
so fresh
so clean
wow
hi
whatup
db?
in a sec sure
lol rekt
on reddit r/cringe
mind reader on howard stern gets called out on camera

wat
my poor pony is hurt
er
oh shit lol what happened
collision
WHAT
are you ok
yeah
other guy is too
what happened?
my fault :/
left turn, I saw the guys turn signal and though he was turning
but he was only changing lanes
oh
as in you thought he was turning right
i thought he was turning left
i don't understand with straight words but I'm glad you're alright
he was changing lanes towards the turn lane, but I thought he was actually in the turn lane
you guys exchange info?
cops came, they got our info
ok
my poor pony isnt okay though :(
you getting charged with anything?
failure to obey a traffic signal
which isnt the worst that can happen
the cop was nice
well that's good
nice when it counts
yes
so insurance is probably gonna hike
but my poor horse :(
it's just a car
its my horse
other guys car is muuuuch worse
he ended up on the sidewalk entirely
nearly hit 2 poles but missed them
air bags, everything
my car was damaged but still able to move and no airbags
so his is totalled
the damage is confined to the front, but it was more damaged than mine
thats for sure
airbags = total loss
i dont know exactly how damaged mine is
we couldnt get the hood open to see
do your parentsk now?
yeah
they both came to the accident site
my poor poor pony
my poor car is all alone and injured in a strange place
it must be scared
looks like frame damage
there was some frame damage we could see near the wheel
its hard to say how much damage though without being able to look in the hood
Im glad you're ok :(
Im sorry about your future insurance.
thanks courtney >_<
Checked for back injuries?
I didn't really get knocked around at all from the accident
no airbag or anything
kk :P
Hi
I bought bullets
hi
Also that short text you sent made sense
lol
"did you raid that base up there?" shotgun to the face
lol
what short text made sense?
Explaining what happened
oh
lol
thal is trying to get me to play Grim Dawn with him
it actually kinda looks fun
What is grim dawn?
it's like titan quest
Whats Titan Quest?
it's like diablo
Ahhhh

i got held up by a bounty hunter
twice
lol
same one both times
i befriended him
and deco and I saved his life
I killed a cop
deco killed a cop while we were SURROUNDED by cops
o.o
i bribed an officer with 10 peaches
and i got to go
mostly because i didnt draw a weapon on them
but I like to think the peaches helped
lol
lol
guys
I like
trains
yis
yes
folks
aram?
arma
cant
heading to a wedding in a minute
what
whose
yer moms

y everyone go away when I can play :<
rude
cuz it is your destiny
clearly
seriously it's like everyone's outside playing and then I step out and people all suddenly ahve other things they forgot to do
ditchital gaming
T_T I hate adulting
nah i've out doing stuff, then i came home and slept until just now
I had sushi
same
well ok i'll do other things :/
3 days until terraria 1.3 :D
i actually have that one
probably still will play 0 hours if the schedules keep up >_<
forget your responsibilities
binge play until something terrible happens due to you not taking care of stuff
would that i could
wat
basically me saying tha tI would if I could
like
how blissful that woudl be
eugh
pants
Thal wants me to buy that Grim Dawn
he wants us all to buy grim dawn
seems funnish
dang weddings
yeh
apparently my mom's wedding
is today?
that's what brandoni said
wait
you're not going to your mom's wedding?
no
is not moms wedding
oh
was joke
xaxaxaxaxa
yo yo yo
i am back
it isnt 10 yet
nope
you win
the before 10
award
woooo
woooo
wooooo
woooooooooooooOOOooooooooo
well, tony could have gotten in on game action before 10 pm
but he wasnt here
nope
knope
how ian cooks chicken: http://i.imgur.com/SYLBURr.jpg
it increased the master taste
wow, right after the steam sale when we buy borderlands, they have a humble borderlands bundle
lol
are you back now?
yep
how goes the mod and things?
mod hasnt really changed much
but
my car
it is in the repair shop
jeez what happened
left turn, i thought the other guy that was coming my way was also going to turn
spoiler: he wasnt gonna turn
well then
gg
yep
that really sucks
yep
how much to fix it?
dunno yet
insurance will cover it
well that's nice
$500 deductable
probably worth
+ whatever the ticket costs
since it was my fault
it's probably $6-7k worth of repairs though
you okay? looks like it was fairly high impact
yeah I'm fine
so is the other guy
my airbags didnt even go off
like, I didnt really even feel a thing
oh
car spun 90* though
lol
other guy went flying on/past the sidewalk
"weeee"
airbags, much more damage
he went right inbetween two poles
really lucky he didnt hit them
damn
it was suprising how little I felt the impact though
like, I've felt more from gokart collisions
well that's good
means your car did it's job
yeah
what was the other dude's car?
my poor poor car :(
maxima
yeah :(
luckily all the damage is front end
ah, his is probably heavier than yours
mmm i dunno
his went flying, mine didnt
lol
yeah but yours spun, his just had momentum
according to google:
maxima: 3556 - 3579 lbs
mustang: 3526 - 3705 lbs
intersting
sting in between things
intersting
I would assume the 3705 is for the v8
probably
so we were probably within 20 lbs of each other
well then you just won the sumo fight
lol
his car looked less repairable, thats for sure
so i bought the most recent humble mobile bundle
lots of those running games
lol
OH
you need to hear the newest sound bite
also type rider is kinda fun, never gotten very far in it though
i was just about to download it
orborun is fun
that escape one is bad
you wanna play some DB? they are testing a new map this weekend
in a bit maybe
okie
still unpacking
psh
just live out of your suitcase
lol
until the next time you need to pack
alex wouldnt appreciate that
that's what I do
I had a dream I went into my bro's house to go pee
and in his bathroom they had a computer set up
playing the steam monster game
I think that's what they call withdrawal from addiction
lol
I cannot wait to sleep in my bed
the bed I was in at the cabin was fucking badong on my back
lol
hallo
hai

o_O this movie has a ton of stargate cast members in it
but it has nothing to do with stargate
what movie?
meow
hi
the movie was something about a dog
apparently David Hewlett (McKay) directed it during their off season
which is why it has Teyla, him, Teal'c, and I think one or two other stargate people
noice
no shepard?
nope
so
new free mercs on DB either soon or already
nader, sparks, and proxy
after the initial nader spam, i think it'll be pretty good
there'll be tons of sparks as well
people are hailing her as the new OP
lol
she's pretty good
this thing
it takes hours to compile
been trying to compile since 9 am
i get like an hour in and hit a bug, try to fix it and start compiling again
>_<
it hogs my cpu/ram too, so browsing the internet while it works is slow
what are you working on?
angies list
the mobile API
it compiles now, but it doesnt run
because it cant find a main class
lol
is this the scala project they had you on?
yes
space dog
what is up
nada
how is things
incoming thunderstorm
things are nice
parents are on their way up to visit I guess
so that's cool
you see the shenanigans of Detectives?
DDD_n_P?

hi

tony you have a skin rash
must be lyme disease
ugh
wat
mom being mom
you have skin
you must be hitler
guh
i hate that
seriously
is bug bite
i scratch
i scratch hard over course of weeks
skin rashes because it's dry and i've been scratching it off
"it look slike a target rash"
she googled lyme disease
never google symptoms
now there's a subconscious nugget in my brain that says "yeah you might have lyme disease bro"
seriously
how to make tony panic: suggest deadly disease
You have Valley fever
its just dormant
yano
waiting a week
neosporining the feck outta it
uncle bozo has lyme disease
seriously?
ouch :<
yeah
lime disease
terarrerarrerarera is update?
oh
lame
1pm est
so like
10 here
hi
hi
how ya doin m8
you could say i'm doing gr8
8/8?
more like gr8/gr8
lets celebr8!
dont h8 on our gr8, just celebr8 m8
you know what grinds my gears
projects that dont have enough documentation for me to be able to run them
yeah that would be horrible
like a group project, and you let your group set the framework and have you finish it, and they did a shitty job documenting anything
I almost have it all working
almost tm
I had to do some really hacky stuff to get gulp to work, but now my db isnt working
because i need to use MariaDB
easy enough, right?
no
because it wont intall on ubuntu
it will only let me install 5.5 and I need 10.0
>_<
o.o
I shoulda just used a mac >_>
when you have to say that, you know the war is lost
the war is indeed lost
jfjsajhfjashfansfas
i got it to install but it didnt fix the error
doesnt your company know the terarrerrreria update comes out today? you should be home already :F
lol
so I think this laptop might not have enough ram to compile this crap
you know what that means
that seems likely
new stuff
woo
I NEED MOAR DEDODATED WAM
OR you could add optimization flags to the compilation
already tried adding flags
nothing is working
>_<
>.>
i'm just guessing it is a memory issue though
idk for sure
it's a stack overflow error
on compilation
that's interesting
stack overflows aren't usually caused by memory shortage are they?
well
the stack overflows
because the stack is too small
most people with similar stack overflow messages on the internet fix it by alloting more ram to SBT/java
aha
just turn everything else off and give it all 2gb :P
I have 8gb of ram :/
wait
no
i have 6.5 gb of ram
I feel like it should compile with that much
probably
ashdgjkahskjga
a;kjshdfl;akjsdf
and yet it doesnt
again
:F
x_x
X_X
I got it to compile
now I am back to the database error
fml
shoot me
please
make it end
I have suffered enough
just come play terraria
call it a night
i cant
lame
oh my god there are ducks now
yur a duck
I yam
i never noticed how strange the word "happeniss" looks when you swap the vowels
lol
hap penis s
yeah
friend is going through a separation and I said that I hoped it ultimately ended in happeniss and was just like OMG WTF DID I JUST SAY
lol
well, more cringe than lol but you know
ehh
i corrected the mistake and she said she appreciated it. also she's a looker so it very well may end in penis for her. i dunno shrug
not my dept.
do i need to update terraria
yesh
unless you have auto updates on
then it probably did already
terraria is tiny
the new ui changes are very nice
seems to be updated
myess
i have to get tacos, but i can terraria when i get back
(which will be before 10)
ooh tacos sound amazing
i have to make pasta though
make pasta tacos
lol
you should hurry back
like a hand held lasagana
I have to get alex at 10 :F
imma go make the pasta now
i think i am really on to something here
lasagana-ish pasta in a taco shell
well I'd take lasagna, put it in a fry-mold and fry it into shape, then put a layer of sauce, meat, cheese, and possibly lettuce if we want to get taco-like
but that'd be a good pastaco
yes
we need to patent this
lol
and sell it to taco bell
close
but not quite
I actually don't see a reference to it in any of the searches
anything like what I described anyway
pasta is done
it is yummy
baque

John Michael?

wait who the feck is this?
chinese intern at SFP
the boss is too cheap to give him a company car, like they said they would before the hired him for the summer
so he has no way to get to work and must carpool but then that means he'd be stuck all day at home with no way to get anywhere
so my mom offered to let him stay with us, and use the money he would be spending on a hotel or whatever on a rental car
uhhhhhhhkay
how well does she know this guy
never met him before total stranger probably gonna strangle us in our sleep
my money is on him being a chinese spy
find name
lol
she knows him well enough
he's been working there for a month i think
Is he hot?
i hear he's a snazzy dresser
my mom says he looks cool, my dad says he looks gay

loool
i wish i could play modded minecraft
one day
vgy
Almost 100 F out here
cycling in the wind is like being in front of a blowdryer
only 91 here right now
cuz it is cloudy and rained earlier
Even that seems more reasonable
D:
lol
I'm used to tropical weather but this is insanity
is it very humid there?
hold on
37% humidity here
54% currently
yuck
lol
I dont like anything above like 10% lol
In the tropics it'd be 70%
haha
If it goes any lower than 30% I start feeling antsy
enter email, get Fragger for free on Dirty Bomb

i need to make this
agreed, so simple xD
This weekend, I am going to make this happen
anywho, gonna head home early today so I can check up on my car in the shop
alright, heading out for the night
ok, good night
cya
I FOUND BULLETS FOR MY GUN
FROM 1909
ERMAHGERD THAT MEANS NO NAZI SYMBOLS
BOOLETS
guys
i got all my angies stuff to compile and run
woo
by pure coincidence
the documentation says to use "devel.conf"
but
in the same folder is a filed named "actuallydev.conf"
so i tried it out of curiosity
and it was the key to everything
lol
well then
that's quite funny
vector thrust seems interesting
i would say no it was frustrating
but
i got paid to figure that out over the course of 2 or 3 days
so (shrug emoticon i am too lazy to google)
and now you can properly document
i'll do that monday
so
my car is up to $16k now
dayum
just got home from the body shop
thats a lot
yes
i saw my poor car
when does your insurance company say "okay too much"?
when the cost is >= 65% of the value of the vehicle
so pretty nearly there
so ~23k is the max
nah
i dont foresee another 7k appearing
i dunno man, it is pretty expensive
$0.74
i'm just surprised they can actually legally make money off of it
well, it isnt gta V
that's true
so
it's 420
#blazeit
420noscope
donde is toneh
I want to terrariform
we can in a sec
gonna clean my room slightly before chinese guest dude shows up
ok
i tossed the mess on the side of my bed opposite my door
out of sight out of mind
hehe

such clean up skills.
wat
hallo
that fucking storm though
hullo
?
wat storm
3am last night
you didn't hear it?
no
i heard people at work talking about it but I assumed the storm must have been at the south end of town
when i woke up there was water on my bathroom floor where it leaks at the vent
so I knew it rained but i didnt realize it like stormed enough to be notable
yeah no storm
3am lightning
shook my entire house
they said it was the loudest thunder they ever heard
my co-workers
like louder than guns
was that the case here too? lol
YEAH
yes
walls shook
sounded like it was right over me
you know how lightly I sleep
like a neighbor body slammed my yard
yes
I find this hard to believe
i do know
i have to flip the mattress to get you to budge
no no no that is just me not wanting to wake up
rather, get up
i wake up easily though
remember, birds woke me up every day in reno
through the wall
if my computer turns on in the middle of the night to update, the case fans wake me up
if the sun rises, the light wakes me up through closed blinds
i genuinely have no idea how you missed it
im gonna go see if my parents hearad it
my dad heard it, but he said it wasnt particularly loud
compared to other storms
must've been over me
my mom also heard it but was able to sleep again easily enough
you live like < 1mi from me
that is nothing when compared to how high lightning is
my conclusion is
glitch in the matrix
i saw 2 of the exact same black car drive by the other day
car ~= cat
the lightning rattled my windows
like
physically
guess i was tired
every now and then I sleep through super loud stuff
I once slept through a wake up call in a hotel
in a single room
with like 4-5 other people
who all got up and chatted and got ready and such
yeah
we all know how "light" you sleep
i dont understand your "use of quotation marks"
you sleep like the dead and wrap yourself like a mummy
i am the lightest sleeper
the sun wakes me up
at like 5 am
if I dont have super thick blackout curtains
you're a visual respondder
not auditory
but sound wakes me up too!
no
nope
it does!
YES!
disbelief
ask anyone else
andrew
ask my mom
ask my dad
ask anyone!
ask jeeves!
she says you're extremely light
but i know the truth
no, you know me trolling you
I am good at pretending to be asleep when I dont want to actually get up
I want to learn Escapist after I have Ghost Love Score down

you must do your duty
wat
on reddit
subs going private
you have to make r/thalagyrt private
in protest
lo
l
that'll show them
Victoria :<
looool
xD
Reddit iz gay
use voat
voat no work
loooooool
everytime something bad happens on reddit
voat has to buy new servers
voat has to buy new servers even when something bad doesnt happen to reddit
well new server space
because it is too busy getting its stuff shut down or blocked
Blocked?
its old host shut it down
for having unmoderated content
like child porn
They killed that
well, it happened and then i never followed up
I seeeee
so now that is my mental representation of voat
try again
i just did
it wont load
which confirms it!
its down cause moar refugees
its like Turkey
and reddit is syria
someone wrote an agar.io bot
oooooo
gimme
ooh someone wrote one that uses a genetic algorithm
oooo
i dont know where it is though
this one apparently uses a genetic algorithm
the source doesnt seem to be visible though
which is sketchy
yeahhhh'
lol the lines and crap this bot draws on the screen are kinda funny
they look so serious
this bot seems to be purely reactionary
this bot is laggy
it randomly just stops moving for like 10 seconds
i found the source to the GA bot
it seems to be signifiantly better
oh?
i dont see any way of choosing your name with the GA bot though
reddit so dying
wow
lol victoria's secret
dangit r/nintendo y u no go private
right?
not surprised r/destinythegame isnt doing it
destiny is lame
and bungie has gone down the shitter lately
lol
amageddon
lol marketing
usa is down
murrica
USA
USA
USA
pcmasterrace y u do dis
up?
down?
deleting all threads related to it
whoa
uhhh
that's funny
especially since GABENs AMA was today
wat really?
it was?
yes
Gabe Newell AMA today
was scheduled anyway
he was definitely going to announce HL3
no doubt about it
go figure
loool
this genetic algorithm bot is pretty good
link-y link
it will even auto split itself it it detects a larger blob is splitting on to you
nice
is safe?
seems to be
mine is at INT level 15
it even ejects mass sometimes
i think it just ejected mass to get the guy who was chasing it to go after the ejected mass instead
lol
what the hell
this bot is an idiot
it just flew head first into another much larger cell
ejecting mass in to it along the way
leading to its death
does this work?
yes
cool
the genetic algorithm seems to be totally unaware that you can eat other blobs
or be eaten by blobs
detectives?
terrrererererer?
i want to terrarrarrararerwerererererrrasrsdfsdgjuhdsfgjdfjuajfiujughisjfjfisjfijaijfuheughusefaflolgetrektasdjfaxjfusfnuhgbdhgnbadg

freaking rekt
so there is a "virtual minecon" happening
mostly with modded MC people
It is set to adventure mode, and I have a basic set of tools so I can get resources
I am considering rigging the conference hall to blow up
tomorrow during one of the events
lolol I was just sliding across the bench during a random QA session on that minecon server, and the speaker stopped to say "apparently naosyth is doing some sort of interpretive dance"
where is everyone :7
oh my god
i have never seen so much cringe
nooooooo
the server shut down right as I detonated my bomb
nobody noticed it
um
minecraft?
?
wher ewas bomb
also
minecon just looks atrocious
"kappa kappa ka...pp...a.... hello cringe compilations"
lol
rekt
and yes mc
what is kappa
a twitch emote that equates to sarcastic face
that song will tell yu about kappa
why must it be in usical form
because it is twitch
the twitch community makes no sense for me
really
that's the point
like
it is the purest form of circlejerk
lol
\o\ we gaming today?
im playing on thal's expert mode terraria server
._.
hm
how was everyone's 4th?
lol ahah
may i join up?
yeah
sec
make a new softcore character for this server
okey doke
is silver a good armor or not really?
it's better than nothing
talk in steam chat, i have to alt tab to get to this
k
ok that was fun
i love how Google's Deep Dream code sees dogs everywhere
hullo
hullo
hai
i am back
hi
wb
tanks
so what'd i miss?
i tried to blow up virtual minecon
i saw that
sounds exciting
i had 9 stacks of tnt
wow
how?
I actully had unlimited access to TNT, but I stashed 9 stacks in my hideout
interesting
I made 10 tnt and then my inv got cleared
so I found an improperly locked pulverizer
and turned glass shards into sand and saltpeter/whatever
then i had some coal i ground up to coal powder and sulfur
that gives gp, combine with sand for tnt
then i was like "what happens if i replace the potatoes in this creative strongbox with tnt
and it worked
so I pulled out stacks upon stacks of tnt
lol
well then
that's impressive
I'm at the episode where Ronon is introduced :D
yayyy
laser gun OP
wow
dev blog for windward:
Well, let's get down to some numbers. The first week of release has seen a concurrent peak of nearly 3500 players, with roughly 15% of them playing online on public servers. One of those servers that had a peak of maybe 25 players throughout all of beta and was deemed "rock-solid" quickly stated having issues once the number of connected players passed the 200 mark, leading me to spending the first few days almost exclusively focused on fixing the server stability. Fortunately that went over well, and by the end of the weekend there were over 300 players connected to the server -- which happened to be running on my own computer. In my home. With a typical household cable modem connection.

grotongs
whenever people get back: Thoughts on camping at Big Bear?
that sounds great! It's in northern california right!? <sarcasmark>
well, i think it is in california
that's close enough right?
although it might not even be in cali
lol
so-cal is almost farther than vegas from reno
big bear is close to me
I can see the mountain from my house
(on a clear day)
then you should be able to easily join us if we camp there! :D
how long are you planning on staying down here?
im not sure, it'll be some time in august though
I have a flexible schedule, so that mostly depends on tony/ian/courtney
bored
Ford just called me, the driver side of the frame straightened up, so now they can start tearing the front end apart to begin repairs
I LIVE
yayyyy
wb to the land of the living
after another  mile 4 day salt lake trip
this time
my battery died
and I had to replace it
no more salt lake for a while though
so
how was salt lake?
was it salty?
salty
we should decide on a camping location and time
I agreeeeee
Big Bear looks nice, so does Redwood National Park, but that is far far away
California is also expensive
it is?
to get access to the park?
well to buy stuff
what kind of stuff?
food
lol
I want water
well we can bring water easily enough
just buy a big pack of water bottles at costco
no no
water
like lake
oh
or river
or ocean
we can dump the water out
to make a river
the locals might grab it though
i hear they want water
both places I mentioned have water though
moar ideas
suggestions?
hmmm
dunno
I am fried right now though
miles in 4 days is 0 fun
I did the math
thats 0 fun per mile
why do you drive 2k miles in 4 days
grandparents needed dentistry
They live 400 miles from Vegas
their dentist is in salt lake
350 miles from Ely
they should just get a dentist in vegas
^
That's my opinion as well
are they old and set in their ways?
yup
Mormon ways
some of the worst ways out there
tell them their dentist suffered from a stroke and is no longer able to perform dentistry
that won't work
They'd just call
to confirm
cut their phone line
or cut the dentists phone line and say he quit
lol
or feed them tons of sugar and acidic stuff so they lose their teeth and get dentures
so many solutions
Vegas dentist = best solution
I am updating my KSP mod pack
its a great pack
ohai
what's up
miles
4 days
0 fun
also we're thinking of places to camp
orite
I want somewhere I can legally bring and discharge a firearm
why
so he can kill us of course
no no
cause self defense
also makes a great activity
I only have rifles
so
it would be hard to pull on people standing right next to you
but you have nazi ammo
so
we could nazi it coming
I'm not going to fire it
its worth too much to shoot
is the cost to wow factor better or worse than fireworks?
because those are pretty expensive to shoot too
those are really expensive
oh also I killed a squirrel in my front yard a few days ago
"is the cost to wow factor better or worse than fireworks?"
why not both?
one shot with our BB gun
I could buy exploding targets
por que no los dos?
andrew is a psychotic squirrel murdering maniac
nah
yah
they dig holes in our front yard
as is their right
and they repopulate like crazy
it is their native land!
naw
we own dis
damn white folk come in and take their land
kill them with their boom sticks
lol
db?
terr?
aram
i hear DB is a mess with the new merc
he is super fast, strong, and 1 shots people
and totally OP
o.o
oh also invisible
>.>
I want him
he will surely be nerfed
I want him now
who the fu
Phantom is his name i believe
anyways
i kinda wanna play terrarrararara.ia
i'm downloading SW:tOR
wat
felt like swangin a lightsabre
star wars: the old republic
the mmo
that's free
if it is like the other starwars mmo I played, you've got quite a bit to do before you get to swang a light saber
supposedly it doesnt take as long as galaxy did
I played galaxy til I got a sabre
jesus that was long
lol
terraria?
the trailer for the newest update on this game was pretty epic
sure tony
which server?
I can terrariform after this finishes dling
mine or thals
i feel like we're godly on thal's
i dig thal's
that was because of the group
individually we get rektd lol
yeah
exactly
lol
well, nobody is on thal's at the moment
and they have moved ahead quite a bit since we played
D: 'course
so
terraria?
yis

Morning ^-^
boo
BOO YOU!
<4
Boo to all of you ^-^
booooooo
guys I am losing my mind
angies list
I need an idea
they need to get their shit together
for a fighter in Kerbal
Watermelon shaped and I agree Brandini.
Make something outright rediculous
make a flying softdrink cup that shoots missiles out of the straw
^ second.
and drops ice cube bombs
kerbal doesn't like circles
or I would
ok
in that case
make a flying house
^second.
like the generic house a 4 year old would draw
with a chimney
that shoots missiles
Make something in honour of our lord and devourer, Kthulu.
Thanks to my dad, my turkey-roastbeef sandwhich just became a turkey-bacon-roastbeef sandwhich
these are all bad ideas
make a flying sandwich
^second.
And actually the turkey-bacon-roastbeef sandwhich is wonderful.
sounds like ian is hard at work making that sandwich
mehhh
I want to go eat something
but I don't have anything here
so I would have to go get something
there is only one solution
eat your own leg
you will be full and not have to go anywhere
I want Ricardos
dont we all
You should all go.
the guy that is staying at my house said he loves cilantro
Brandon is helping angies list
Sicko
and there for cannot ricardos
no, i am sitting here unable to do ANYTHING
because they are crap
Go get ricardos
i am at work though so i cant really just leave
lol
i am making my terminal look nice and clean
such simple
very efficient
wow
originate@originate@redundancy@originate
lol
I should rename it so it doesnt take so many characters
I didnt name this user or laptop
make it: now@udiemrbond
imma go make lunch :3
what are you making?
my guess is...
toaster oven leftover pizza
or maybe grilled cheese
possibly a quesodilla
lol
nope, sausage and eggs
and sourdough toast
that was my next guess
lol
the sourdough didn't happen
pineapple did instead
but it was still yummy
you have a deepdream folder?
yes
i havent installed all of its dependancies though
what were you gonna use it for? just fo funz?
yeah
gotcha
so SW:tOR is pretty good
it's good if you're in a star wars mood at least
the opening cinematic is really good
i can play music from my command line now
via google music streaming
it was a pain in the ass to get working
because everything is always a pain
but it works :D
I had sushi
i had pasta
I had a rock :(
tasty
i like pop rocks
^second.
nah
candy is lame
ian is an old man who dont like candy and sugar or anything sweet
and if he sees you on his lawn he will steal your candy and throw it away
eat some carrots
carrot cake!
no
eat avocados
with cilantro
and lime
i cant just eat straight avocados
it needs to be on something
crackers man.
crackers man, not the hero we need, but the hero we have
and his sidekick, apples woman
lolol
you mean cheese woman
no
apples
no
YES APPLES
cause crackers man says "jeez woman" and she's all "yes sir?"
no
apples
he says "grapples woman" and she says "yes sir?"
dafuck
lol
none of this stuff just runs out of the box
and it all has either super outdated documentation or none at all
and nobody at angieslist is useful
ugh
kill me please
make it end
scrap it and start over :P
I have one module running 100%
the module I was SUPPOSED to be working in
now
now I have to work across 3 modules and 3 projects
1 project isnt working at all
1 project runs with no errors but doesnt seem to work
1 module will not compile at all no matter what
another module runs with errors
and I have to run two modules at the same time from the same repo on different branches
idk how to do that
are you the only one working on it?
no, one other guy
who started same time as me
he doesn't know any more about all this than I do
lol
so this play music command line thing is nice
it had an 11 month bug though
the developer was like "i dont have enough time to fix it"
and I made a workaround in like 5 minutes
GG
hi
also lol
hi
what's the loot from Skeletron Dungeon?
we didnt get much more after you got off
mostly just duplicates of what we already had
gotcha
new microwave steams broccoli like broccoli boss
so, I am trying to fix this command line google play music application
so that playlists work
but the API doesn't have any way whatsoever to get song information from a playlist track
which means it is impossible to get song names or artists for tracks in a playlist :/
you can play the track, you just wont know what the song is ahead of time
seems like a design flaw
are we teraring or good guysing tonight?
we can
i am piano in a few minutes
ok
i am able to play something now
ok
did you want to?
yes
ok, what? :D
we could do more terrarria
coo
coo
only going until like 10 though

"Scruffy the squirrel was an old squirrel whose teeth weren't so strong. He needed to give his walnut to his friend crackWalnut() before he could eat it. But Scruffy had magical "pass by value" hands. If he picked up his walnut and just gave it crackWalnut(), then his friend would only get a duplicate of the walnut, and Scruffy's walnut would remain uncracked.
So Scruffy wrote down the location of the walnut and gave that to crackWalnut() (the scrap of paper he wrote on was duplicated like always), who would then go dig it up, crack it, and bury it again."
best explanation of pointers ever
i just imagine crackWalnut() to be some ruffled looking squirrel that is addicted to crack
we should be detectives tonight
and a private eye
lol
woo
i fixed the command line music player

hi
so apparently cilantro tasking like soap is an actual thing
and not just courtney being crazy
um yes
there was an article i linked like 2 weeks after the hike lol
oh
well
i apparently didnt read it
and if i did i forgot about it
lol
yeah they think the cilantro is trying to kill them
crazy people
cilantro is killer, not trying to kill you
my ubuntu now looks 1000x better
mmhm
my laptop came :D
it's the one for 1229
I got it for 1150 though
hmm
"intimidating desing"
lol yeah
their marketing guys obviously bypassed their design guys for taglines
Eye-Popping visuals
>.>
lol
it's nice
screen is a beaut
battery life is probably subpar but they're doubling the capacity of lithium batteries soon so I can probably upgrade
fingers crossed
eye popping is such a strange adjective
looks like a nice laptop
I'm curious how the SSHD will perform
wooo my fix for PlayMusicCL got merged in to master :D
that's my first open source contribution ever
WOOHOO
waht is that
what is what
oh playmusiccl
play music command line
what do
oh hey
nao
look what i called
ok so it's not her little sister
but still
resigned
wat
Pao resigned
now they just need Victoria back
lol
wow Pao actually resigned
that's awesome
the sshd is weird
like
the allocation of memory seems off
it's got like 24gb instead of 8
or so it seems
idk
havent had time to mess with it
oh, you already have the laptop?
I figured you ordered it online
yeah it just came yesterday
I ordered it on the 6th
ah
will you be able to terraria today?
from 430 to 8, yeah
:F
well, we're probably gonna enter hard mode today
oh goody
oh look just in time for me to get a haircut and then go do other things
im still at work
so
Im bark
yo yo yo
i just smushed my finger
kinda hurt
ouchie
my new theme has the close and minimize buttons on the top right of the window instead of the top left
it is messing me up
its probably just your finger
probably
also alex is going to a party tonight probably so I might have more time to play than I thought
\
indeed
so what do we need to do before hard mode?
well that depends
meister added a new chest room
and we're working on a plant room
we COULD go as far as blocking the crimson from spreading
and a bosas fighting platform
you know that would be a good thing to do
probably
there'll still be pockets that make it weird
so it'd be nice to have all the caves explored
theres a lot of caves
yeah
there are no balloons on this world
only horse shoes
well that's no fun
we're gonna have to explore an alternate to get some
yes
so clean
so bootiefull
this desktop environment lets you tile windows like that easily
looks nice
it's cleaner than Unity imo
much less... big taskbar
lol
nice
this game looks fun
also I got elite: dangerous
it's on sale this weekend
20 ducks off :P
looks like a cool game
indeed
I got my bayonette
It was labeled as a souvenir camping tool
lol
lol
so it was not harassed by customs
in Bulgaria, France, or the US
which where the stamps on the box
interesting
not like TSA likes actually looking in boxes anyway
nah it went thru ICE
aha
immigrations and customs enforcement
also brandog camping need dicussion
does anyone here know how/if it is possible to change what shows up before the $ on a linux terminal?
what are you running?
ubuntu
hmmm
so that instead of
#839496
it's your account name isnt it?
er
what you log in as?
originate@originate-ThinkPad-X1-Carbon:~$
normally that's it
i just want originate$
it's like your computer name and your account name or something
yeah
but I want it to just be account name
could change your computer name to ""
changing names is a pain
lol
^
lol
you could just live with it
but when I have a small terminal window it takes up so much line space
yeah that'd annoy the hell out of me
there's gotta be a way
*a better way
(in idiot salesman assistant voice)
usermod -u UID username
?
oh cool, i found how to do it
oh?
edit ~/.bashrc to have: PS1=~$\
or whatever you want
that makes it just be ~$
oh that works
way less sloppy looking
and you can do something like PS1=$USER~$\
to have it be your user name
anywho, gonna head home now
kk
i dont know where the power/sleep menu is on this new destop environment
:l
probably in the settings menu button on the bottom left?
it was, but it was an unusual looking icon that I didnt immediately recognize as the shut down button
anyways
i am home
terrarrarararar.io?
did you hear about agar.io integrating facebook and everyone raging?
no
if you login using facebook you start with 5 mass
instead of 1
that is so insignificant
indeed
people are still pissed tho
dunno why
like why even bother
lol
yep
it means you can split and eat a brand new non-facebooker right off
if you're gonna buff fb give them an amount that is actually a buff
but that's it
5 mass cant split
no?
no
oh
well then
nvm :P
anywho
seriously like 5 mass probably isnt even a visible difference
donde otha peeps?
yeah probs not
they gone
whay
tell ya whai
I needta grade some mo today, so I'll play when peeps get back
ian is back
am i though
what "is" back?
are you actually a robot?
also what "is" camping
even robots can be back
it is when a person sits in one location waiting for other players to come by so he can kill them without much effort
arnold says "i'll be back" and he comes back
anywhos
brandon which side of the weekend works better for you?
doesnt matter
the friday side or the monday side
I thought you said it did
i can take friday and monday both off
no
the more days i have to take off, the sooner I need to request it
if I take a week off, I have to request it soon
if it is just like a monday and friday off, its nbd
we'll need at least 5 days to do redwood
2 can be weekend
so we could do a friday-tuesday type thing
or something
yeah
or we could do a different location
that could work
also a possibility
since redwood would be fun, but thats at least 2 days of just driving
4 days
if we do the up to reno
sleep
redwood
yeah
back
and back
plus the we could bring Andross
kings canyon maybe
in socal
thats much closer
plus sequoias are cool
yeah
6 hours
though the easy route there is Death Valley
which will be 127 degrees in mid-August
lol
the death valley route says 7.5 hours on google maps
taking the 15 is 6 hours
odd
lol
well 15 still goes through baker
which will only be 122
yeah
way better
seems like we'd be able to do much more in 5 days at kings canyon than redwood
Thats true
its not too far from Andrew if he wanted to drive
we'll need to make a reservation
yes
we'll need to confirm who is coming too
raises hand
raises hand
needs a date and more details
tentatively weekend of aug 15, I am guessing
^
cuanto cuesta?
no hablo
how much is it/
like $20
and for how many days?
thats per vehicle, for 7 days
we'd probably leave friday morning
or thursday morning
and come back monday or tuesday
so 20 bucks per day, per vehicle? or 20 bucks per vehicle for seven days
20 bucks gets 1 vehicle in for 7 days
ok
aaand
hmm
i'll still be grading
and I have to grade on fridays
can you grade ahead of time?
the assignments get turned in thursday at midnight
I also dunno if alex can
she's already gotten like a full month off work
but i will look into it
you do that
let us know
preferably like tonight
lol
it probably wont be tonight
it's kinda late in the game to be reserving a camp site
but if you keep reminding me then it'll probably be by tomorrow
hello
o/
i just put my server up
if you wanna join
yup
password is "cavendish"
Georgiana :D
nao
why does it say I can't join you?
he doesnt like you
>.>
server isnt up right now
oh
boon
boonsyth
ht y so a noob
boo naosyth
you sound like hippos
I just thought it was interesting that if you put boo in front of your name, turn it backwards and space it weirdly, you get an almost coherent sentence calling you a noob
a laserlamp sentence
^
I'm pretty happy windows 10 comes out before school starts back up
windows 8 is ugleh
I like it for the most part
I'd like it more if I had a touch screen
the windows screen is just awful though
yeah
other than that I really like it
i personally hate any and all metro design
I already bypassed to the desktop
there was an ELI5 today that was pretty informative of how 10 fixes the bad things from 8
like the forced metro design
windows 7
4 lyfe
or until windows 11
windows 10 is supposed to be a better windows 7
supposed to be
I bet they find a way to send you ads

lol
so andrew yes or no on camping
nah I can't
alex has work and school, and she can't really get out of both
well, after a few hours of figuring out how to fly a fucking spaceship I just finished all the tutorials for elite dangerous
I am thoroughly impressed
I have barely scratched the surface and I'm already loving it :D
I found a free headtracking software that replaces trackir if you have a decent webcam :P
oh?
facetracknoir
works for WT as well
pretty easy to set up too, just have to tweak a few settings to trade some smoothness for response
I have trackIR
lol
trackIR is spensive
dat war thunder
hi
hi
you should get elite dangerous while it's on sale :D
no tengo money
just bum some money off a bum
they make like 100 a day
welp, skeletron prime appeared out of nowhere
i got him half killed before i died :(
did you guys go hardmode?
ytes
oh nice
Why'd he appear?
they randomly appear
oh really
that's weird
yup
like eye of cthulhu
but hurt way more XD
also, god my char in poe is op as fuuuuuuu
glass cannon tho
freaking really
solar eclipse followed immediately by a blood moon followed immediately by another solar eclipse
what are the odds
calculable odds
o/
o/
you guys are hardmode now?
yes
way to go guys
well solar eclipses are 4% chance to happen, and blood moons are 10%
so
calculable for sure
i accidentally summoned plantera
got rekt
lol
did he tell you to walk?
well i was in a tiny little cave
so i ran out of walking space in about 0.1 second
andrew/tony, want to give me a hand killing plantera?
going to bed
night
I might be able to in a bit
we'll see
ok
I can kill it
NO PREMADE CHARACTERS
i know you can
if I can use Mr. Hilter
lol
I need at least one other person though
lol
really?
Well normally
at your level i'd expect you to solo him
If I have an open area no
but its a jungle
i have an openish area dug out
next to 2 bulbs
gonna get a flame thrower and try to kill him
^
you just need a demonic+ harpoon
i have good weapons
harpoon OP in close range
terra blade :D
Vampire Knives best weapon
no tengo
por que
how do i get them?
vamp knives come in the crimson chest in the dungeon
they're awesome
ah how get key
but the meowmere is the best
by far
actually
it isnt the best
the end game yoyo outdoes it
by far
NO
MEOW
Vampire Knives don't cost mana and the give you health
sec, killing skeletron prime
vampire knives + magnetic sphere spell is my go to
oh and that raincloud rod
ffffuuuuuu
died
woo i killed plantera
now bed time
dammit
I get home 5 minutes late
lol
gotta finish this stargate episode
but yeah
but hardmode dungeon is open now </3
that is <3 ot </3
because better yoyos
im sad because server is closed
lol
o i c
hardmode dungeon is probably my favorite challenge in the game
that ninja bruce lee guy is hard
indeed
OOH
what dropped from plantera?
grenade launcher
plz be pygmy staf
some rockets
damn
nope
but if i can solo him, you and I should be able to kill him a few times
pretty easily
rolling ranger till I can get the endgame summoner armor
because megashark is so good
i have new jungle yoyos
and the sword
true
i forget the name of the sword
I have a flamethrower and a sharkgun
terra blade?
yes
that's the one
the true night's edge and true Excalibur together
yes
those solar eclipses sure paid off didn't they
lol they did
Finally got skype to work again, seems version 7.6 can cause instability in some machines.
o/
o/
I just got a gg unique dagger in path of exile :D
contemplating selling it to buy a chestpiece for this char though
i just want my end game yoyo
terraria then?
11k dps <3
at work
aww
the arms of this chair do not jive well with the height of this desk
i much prefer my chair/desk at home
they should have let me design these desks
lol
so, people up for terraria when I get home?
yesy
jungle temple time?
playing on the gh server, just entered hardmode lol
uhhhhhhhh
need some stuff before im confident about that fight
psh just charge in head first
golem hits like a truck
i seem to remember him being easy to fight without him bing able to hurt you at all
if you cheese the fight, yes
nothing wrong with cheese
but I don't remember how to do it
yoyos were practically invented for cheese
lol
you off in 10 minutes im guessing?
i usually leave at 5:30 ish
mmk
less traffic that way
oh my god im craving guac right now
guac reminds me of corn, and corn reminds me of a meeting we had earlier today
one of our devs was talking about corn
o.O
and most of us throughout the meeting thought corn was a programming thing
he was talking about corn being hard and the seasonality of it and stuff
lol
at seasonality I started questioning whether it was literal corn or not
because he started off by saying he was researching corn
lol
so is our base in shambles?
has the horizon been flattened?
our base is fine
meister and i are on
if you wanna join
password is corn
carn
lol
maybe
in an odd mood
may join
we'll see
ok so
on a scale of meh to grr how rage inducing would this be? http://i.imgur.com/X5In8f9.jpg
i'm serious about that $9 thing but I'm worried it'll piss people off
I'll do it for $7.50
i'll write a web app that does it free

lol
"Get Railed!"
There is still a Sands in Reno?
I thought they tore them all down
lol
lol they built a new one in Macau to replace the Vegas one
i guess the reno one withstood the Sands of time
buh bum tis
ok but srsly
yes or no
don't want to incite rage
fuck it
maybe i'll just do it for 5
nah
dibs if you make a webapp nao :<
lol
Yeah I would avoid that whole schtick
i dont see a market for it

so
lol
you need dumb people for your peanut gallery
people have been posting quotesperationals left and right
im so meta even this acronym

Tony?
tony is exceptionally good at disappearing mid conversation
and then he was gone
tony is more of a wizrod than brandog
but a wizron is neither early nor late
wizrod*
and tony is missing
He fell out of time
technically he's not early or late though

(☞ﾟ∀ﾟ)☞
EYYY
We got a response
it's camping after my big bear
faire
little bear was a good show
twas
so
now we need to plan
sec solar eclipse
it's simple
we kill the batman
so
so
we're thinking a 5 day thing
which means
either thursday/friday + monday
or
friday + monday/tuesday
i can do either
same
Tony?
wait what what
what
i have to bow out
mayb
e
i dunno
<.<
must research
work keeps me as a slave man :/
can you have an answer by like 2 tomorrow?
we could trim to 4
so i can make a reservation
days
and yes 4 is possible
so a monday-friday thing could work
or thursday-sunday
or saturday-tuesday
uhhh
yeah
i can have an answer
okie dokie
if that doesn't work maybe we should think further down the road
meow
woof
how's it goin?
'salright
o/
0/
Brandog
did you get an up or down from the Tony
no
dang
ok i have an answer
also no one texted me so i forgot
and the boss didn't ahve tim to discuss things :<
wat
what was your answer?
oh right
my answer is "no"
won't be ble to go at the current moment
dag nabbit
I don't know how to get time off
1. Beg
2. Plead
3. Kill
you can't take 1 day off?
didn't have time to ask
boss running around
me running around
what time span are we going for?
we need to set it
like in stone
it's what i said yesterday
weekend of 15th
what days we take off is up to you
ian and I can do whatever
you typically dont work fridays
so
thursday/friday/weekend or friday/weekend/monday
i know weekend of the 15th
2 days 3 days or 4 days
weekend + 2
4 days
can't swing that
but you didnt even ask :(
(work)(drive/camp)(camp)(camp)(camp/drive)(work)
yes
that soon after faire i will not be able to swing that
would the following weekend be better?
that would actually be more swingable
more time between time-offs as well
what days off work best for you? end of week or beginning?
eh
:/
I have responsibilities done every Mon/Thurs
so
End would be best i suppose
so you want to do 3 days then?
that would be optimal
now don't get me wrong I would LOVE 4 days
but
wait god dammit
Aug 22
ok whew
no
not end of month yet
yay
we can of course do it later too, but it'll start getting cold
and a lot of places will close camp grounds
yeah no that weekend works

:7
I want to buy a good set of headphones (no mic) for music at work. any suggestions on a good brand?
I hear bose makes headphones now
bose
bose all teh way
you probably already saw that
poor black science guy
getting so much flak because pluto has water
oh snap
wat
who said it has water
ur mum
i thought it was just frozen nitrogen
I heard they were water
the mountains
it has ice mountains
yeah, I guess it's still speculation at this point but frozen nitrogen can't make rigid ice mountains like they're seeing on it's surface
so it's probably water they're thinking
anyone on doing things?
meister and ia re on terrararsarasrase
oookay
password?
and are you folks chatting
that page is fucking great
I GOT THE YOYO :D
congrats!
Anyone else here in Vegas just have a brown out?
a wat
power brown out
lights dim, fans slow
etc
is that like a black out but more politically correct?
no
oh
well, no
okay
I'm not crazy
NV Energy detected it
S. Eastern & I-215
my dog just scared the shit out of me
jesus
suddenly my closet door just started banging like someone was inside of it
my yoyo loadout is complete
and i almost have all the achievements
Hi all
yoyo
you and your yoyos
we should do some arma some time
I agree
However it looks like the Altis server has gone down
steven sings
constantly
who
the chinese guy staying with me
CHINNGGGG CHONGGGG
WOONNGGG DINNGGG
does he sing well?
eh he could be worse
but that doesnt matter
Huiqu Shangban
in sufficient quantity any quality of singing gets annoying
tra lalala
Derkters
is camping still a thing?
yes
idk which campground we want though
One with a lake/river/steam/substantial body of water
if youre planning on it soon, keep in mind that the cajon pass (the single best way into socal from vegas) is on fire right now
like the entire fracking thing
Nah abit over a month
want to come?
We can pick you up
lolol
in our bi-weekly all-hands meeting today, someone gave a live demo of their 20% project
they went to enter a text field and one of the suggestions was "ARICS FUCKING LEAGUE BITCHES"
and it froze for like 10 seconds with that up on the screen with everyone at originate watching
(aric was the guy doing the demo)
the previous page also had a list of leagues and descriptions. most of the descriptions were blank, but one was "these niggas gonna win"
u w0t
m8
sup
about to head home
i spent all day working on this error message
and I think I finally have a lead on how to fix it
.... right as I have to leave
>_<
I'll be sure to forget what I was gonna do by the time I get home
Great plan!
that way you can waste more time tomorrow
on a scale of me to ellen pao how fired was that guy
is this worth it?
TIS-100 looks really fun
but that's a very opinionated opinion
and nah, everyone got a good laugh
no firing
the freaking CEO was in the meeting
lol
cool
I work directly with Aric on angieslist
good stuff
although dragon bro got gimped
"The final boss' attacks now use their own cooldown for immunity due to how naughty some of our players have been."
I'm not sure exactly what that means
perhaps that the cross necklace and similar equipment doesnt affect him
i think the best change of all is: You can now hide the Moon Charm and Neptune Shell's effects...or put them in vanity!
i was working on getting both of those
but i didnt want to turn into a werewolf
i don't know what those are
lots of stat buffs
but turn you in to a werewolf at night
ahah
which isnt bad
but it changes how you look
and i like looking how I look
lol
Dat dog
Has rabies
45% chance
we were looking at that in the office a week or two ago

Potentially fixed invasions not triggering when they should (Martian Probes)
Fixed Money Trough turning 'Quick Stack to All Chests' button invisible
thank you terraria ^^
one of the interns in SF is named "Brandon Woo" and people keep tagging him instead of me, since his name is so similar but first alphabetically
>_<
fml
fml sooo hard
i spent 3 or 4 days on this damn bug
you know what the source was?
a lower case 't'
lol
no lol
just fml
seriously
i rewrote huge portions of this like 3 times trying to fix it
when i saw that "entitytype" i was so conflicted
i was excited to see the solution, and sooooo annoyed with how simple it was
lol
...damn
i has new headphones :D
what kind?
audio technica
ath-m40x
where doyou review those stuff
?
like what makes you choose the different products?
google
the new game by Frictional Games is out on Sept 22nd apparently
called?
SOMA
...hmm
not developed with The Chinese Room
so it might not suck balls
...hmmmmmmmm
hopefully they have made improvements to their engine though
AAMFP ran like crap
even on high end hardware
hm
game looks pretty cool
wonder how it'll compare to dead space and alien
it'll probably be quite different
since you can't seem to kill the robots
we can only hope
or have any sort of weapon
i guess you couldnt really kill the alien either
true
unkillable things are scary though
more so than killable things
yeah
would be really cool if it was coop
I feel like coop horror games should be a thing
co-op with permadeath would be cool
yeah
so far it looks really good though, i just actually watched the gameplay trailer all the way through
i'm kinda excited now
I went to that ricardos
did you eat the cilantro?
In guacamole form
their guac is good
their bean dip and chips is even better
what was your entree of choice?
Carne

with hood corn?
si

new humble jumbo bundle has a few good games
endless space, merc kings
comes with a discount for medieval engineers too
guys
it took my entire life, but I finally got this endpoint working
22 years well spent
woo
good news all around :D I got my new flight control system today
watsdat
you know what this means
deco is going to make you play WT with him
lol
It's for elite dangerous
they designed the controls in-game after this setup
partnership thing during their crowdsource funding stage
when you press buttons or do things with your flight stick, your in-game dude moves the stick and stuff too
fancy
now you just need an occulus rift
for total immersion
yeah it's next on my buy list actually (once it comes out commercially)
I have that head tracking software set up until then though
it's pretty sweet
i'll definitely have to try war thunder out with this setup
it's pretty sweet so far
its the guy from stargate! https://i.imgur.com/idIaf7O.webm
i saw that episode again recently
all i could imagine is him being super excited about food
hehe
that was the greatest when i figured out who he was
hes a backstabbing wraith worshiper
that's who he is
I know what a dick
this joy/throttle deal is awesome
so much better than my last joystick
play minecraft with it
I really could
lol
lol
it has a mouse controller
and left/right click
and mouse wheel
probably wouldnt be much worse than playing mc on an xbox
and that's only on the left hand
yeah
it'd be better for sure
there'd be useless controls, sure
but there are useless controls in E:D anyway
E Smiley Face
E : D
you missed out on all the new terraria stuff
we beat the game
lol
i was away at a wedding
and playing E: D
now that you beat it we have to play some borderlands :D
no now I have to build a bigger nicer house
and get the last few achievements
ah
i only have i think 7 left to get
4 of which are fishing related
200 quests will take foreverrrrrrr
lol
just make yourself a house in each biome and make the fishing dude move in to each one so you're closer when turning in quest fish
well i can tp to him to turn quests in
travel isnt the limiting factor
the limit is that you can only do 1 quest per day
o.O
that does seem like overkill
I'm at like 20ish quests
lol
10% woo
aww yiss
10%
making dat progress
now that I dont have a lowercase t stopping me from doing anything, I am actually able to do stuff!
das bootyful
as in
boo "t"
heh
thanks tony
yeah tony
thanks
so I fixed a bug a little while ago
it was preventing my messages from generating activities
the solution: change a lower case letter to upper case
why does this keep happening
at least this time it only took me like 5 minutes to fix
lol
I think you just need to lower/upper convert everything
always same case
"this feels...familiar" - Brandon
hyeeeup
well it was foreshadowed but still
the situations with the parents wasn't really referenced again, but the scene did show the development of the brothers relationship
sorta
but then "we'll still be brothers" thing was like
the fuck
whose kids are yall
dat $160 sim setup
hi
guys
lets do it
do it?
yes
just do it
(TM)
waddafak
there are new emotes
from that movie
$$$$
from what movie
the one where emotions are personified
ah
and it has the lady from the office voiding one of them
idk any more about it than that
inside out or osmething
i jsut see words in parenthesis
voicing*
gotta step yer emote game up, tony
so I am looking at the campgrounds at sequoia
trying to find one near water
water+
water++
water += 1
water = water + 1
it looks like there are 3 camp sites near rivers
Buckeye flat, lodgepole, and dorst creek
dorst creek says no new reservations can be made
poignant
lmao
idk about the movie but that review was fun to watch
right
so well spoken
Does Buckeye Flat have water?
there's a blue line on the map
that I am assuming represents a river
lets google it
there is also something that says "river walk" in the top left of the map
lol every picture is water
That's my point
lol
how far is it form the actual trees
you know
well there are no available spots at buckeye for our date range apparently
dang
maybe we should consider another location?
we can
Tony
ideas?
or input?
crawdad canyon in utah is nice
it's a climbing place, but the canyon itself is also nice
tony and I have been there
crawdad canyon I'm always down for
nice walks, a river, and plenty of boulder challenges
but something new is always fun as well
tis where the infamous tom prank went down
How hot is it in August?
umm
i'd imagine not hot
iirc it shuts down in september
because it freezes
ohh
buckeye doesn't seem bad
buckeye has no more slots
yeah but it's apparently booked that weekend
sequoia does have some locations that dont require reservations
I'm sure if we just showed up we could find somewhere to set up some tents
but no guarantee we'd be anywhere decent
Thats true
that seems so risky
well, we can consider crawdad canyon to be the backup plan
it's pretty easy to get a reservation there
yeh
Crawdad canyon does look nice
how far from towns is it?
not very far
guns probably not a good idea in that area
guns arent allowed in california parks either
just fyi
State parks no
national yes
no
Yes
The law was changed 2 months ago
nps.gov specifically says that you can't bring firearms to sequoia
Boo
will we even get a camping space there?
where?
Sequoia
well
there are a lot of spots
If we roll the dice right?
lol
dont roll the dice
just doll the rice

I know
but its made up
lol
lol ah
I mean, design wise
they hit the nail
on the head
gonna build that in kerbal
lol
that looks like it might be a solid design
I think its worth testing
in /r/worldbuilding
I was so hoping it was for a game
no dice
I love MiG designs
I hate commies
but MiG made some top quality stuff
lol
One sec
I'll show you
That's a real design

tell me a stupid joke
a one or two liner
new or old
doesnt matter
horse walks into a bar, bartender says "why the long faCE?"
Horse replies: "My alcoholism is ruining my family."
lol
alternatively: "My son has multiple sclerosis."
alternatively: The horse doesn't respond. He looks slightly confused and doesn't speak English.

that is now one of the test messages in my database
some day I'll be going over this and forget that's in there
and have a laugh

lol
GLS has weird timing
who
oh
it varies a lot
YES
YESSSSS
my changes to this code finally worked!
wahoo
wahoo
I need ideas for side projects to work on
"Oblique Strategies" app?
wat do
within what scope
what
are there any liiations
limitations
preferably not somthing huge that would take more than like 2-3 months
trying to think of a problem i hAVE
oooh ok
can you make something like this:
Take a photo of a business card. Converts details (name, address, phone number, business namem aybe? etc.) to text
then adds them to a contact
that sounds difficult
getting accurate strings would be hard
since business cards are all different
and determining what is what is tricky
because if there are multiple phone numbers you need context to know what each is used for
etc
ok so something simpler then
white noise app?
that just generates white noise?
something like so http://asoftmurmur.com/
already exists
i attempted to use it to drown out bart
when he wouldnt stop coughing
i unno
make an auto-grading program that grades these kid's designs by itself
println("F")
done
now make a high end marketing campaign and put it on kickstarter
I kinda want to make a web api/front end of some sort
but I have no clue what it would do
downloadmorewam.com
well here's what i'd like
WYSIWYG stuff would be cool
i know they have sliders and grids...and parallax...
honestly anythng that allows for easy motion graphics
WYSIWYG stuff that does what?
i see
like Flash?
except not
yah
an interesting idea
i know there's After Effects but...yah
but I still want to make an API
but alas I have no ideas
anyways bbl, driving home
narrow, scalding and irrational has to be the most cynical view of that, ever
i love it
me3
new insult for my repertoire
"You're like pi."
"...sweet?"
"Irrational"
lol
i love the webcomic of i and pi arguing
"You're irrational." "Get real."
Tony
hi
hi
I made that plane
turns out
its a good design
looks like you need intakes on each side of the cockpit
oh nvm i see them now
that was a cool plane
I took a couple liberties, but its close enough
and it works
it is nice looking
test
test
these messages wont go away
>_<
yay I got it :D
no more glitched skype messages junking up my chat
so
we should paly gaem
tomorrow we should play lots of gaem
because alex is gone from 10-4 and you folks are finally in a non-work environment hopefully
same with sunday
at some point on saturday i have to go to dinner with my people
but I think I am otherwise free all day
woo
you folks should get the humble jumbo bundle so we can play merc kings
it's fun
and very much more fun in coop
you can get a free movie rental and 90 days of google music all access if you own a chromecast
also: google is a damn liar when it says "you can choose from thousands of titles including the following" when you go to get the free movie
it listed John Wick and then it charged me
GOOGLE LIES
it says it qualifies, but it in fact does not
lame
hi
hi
wow
that's awesome
the whole center circle is actuated
not sure if I'll leave it solid or not
it looks really, really cool
lol
how long did it take?
around an hour
1000000000000 hours
on facebook
and WHAI
ONE BIRRION DORRAHS
its kinda inconveniently placed
right in the middle of the subway
lol
just like real life monuments/statues
this is true
inspired by the steam sale game? http://store.steampowered.com/app/385770/
wat
the main bits of the new terraria base are made :D
time to tear down the old base
this is like lightsabre katanas the game: http://store.steampowered.com/app/345180/
woww
nice
that's massive
and what she said
thanks i get that a lot
lol
ant man was good
gonna add a tower at the top of it that extends to the surface where the old base was
alex and i went to see it
i want to see it
funny enough to stand up to guardians of the galaxy
and enough phony science with little explanation to be a marvel movie
lol
you should get merc kings
and play with me
-1
gg

you guys are much better at that than twitch chat
yes
we probably play pokemon better than twitch chat too

I'm ranked 801 in war thunder
lol
wow
there are only like uhhh
500k active players
woo finished my tower
con
grats
yo meister
i might change my world to be expert mode
Can I join with my hardmode character then
since this is all unbroken ground now
yes
woot
btw, arma later today?
I think so
what mode?
probably wasteland
Okay
We did really well as indies
surprisingly
lol
lol yeah
poor pvt. mill's base
#rekt
you tell him son
EXPERT MODE WOO
gimme a few minutes to run some dungeons in trove and ill be on
k i gotta compile tedit for 1.3 and then switch it to expert
so what exactly is expert?
mobs have 2x health and do more damage
extra special drops from bosses
mobs have double health, double damage, and bosses drop way more loot
is the loot super cool?
new AI for bosses too
you also drop 75% of your gold on death instead of 50%
mobs can pick up your dropped money
but they drop way more money
oh good
I'm already rich
lol
are there more powerful weapons?
yes
you mean in 1.3?
or in expert?
both
1.3 has new tiers of stuff
mostly expert
oh?
I don't have those yet
expert doesnt add any new items other than boss loot i believe
the top tier 1.3 stuff is available in normal or expert
ah
whats the new top tier mage armour?
stardust i think
how get
and apparently we have yet to beat the pumpking on this map?
we already have the stuff to make a set
nebula is mage armor
oh
stardust is summoner
how get
my guy is mage
it should be expert mode now
how much luminite do you have
98 bars
114 ore
thats a lot
got any nebula fragments?
can I make armour
yes
pass
?
also call?
pass is wakka

Ronon Dex
he's pretty badass

tony
hm
did you see the new terraria base yet? :D
lol
nop
whoa
did you take that screenshot with you hovering in the center of the tower like a badass?
oh there's a platform there isnt there
lame
lol
the docs symbol isn't all bright and pretty
it can be turned on/off
it is actuated
and you didnt turn it on for the screenie? psh attention to detail!
if it lags it's possible for it to ony partially actuate
which is a huge pain to fix
ah
Fail, Brandini.
^
Make it actuate properly
its the game
it is bork
actually actuate!
fix it
I do insist, good sir.
I don't insist
the power of courtney compels you
ian doesnt insist
so i wont
^
Ian is evil
Blam
evil is efficient
lol
evil is badong
RIP
wat
you've killed the courtney
that is fucking sick
but fucking sick is no fun
being all achy and feverish
bleh
;P
i need a new theme for my character's appearance
death to all non-believerssssssssssss
well since you sided with ian's disapproval, you should make him evil themed
Shadow character
i was thinking splinter cell theme
ooh that'd be cool
they have the goggles
or you could be a ninja
that sounds amazing
i like angel of death
i already am an angel
of justice
aww yis
you could just go back to being a lowly construction working turtle
I'm not using wings any more so I need something that looks good w/o wings
stop
u stahp
you get death by butt kick
satan
splinter cell goggles require shroomite and idk if it will dye properly
i need a new idea
I should be ronon dex
except i dont have a cool energy pistol
or dreadlocks
awe :(
you could char edit yourself some dreadlocks
and there are laser pistols
i dont think dreads are an option
i swear i saw some
there are like 60 options
i'm looking at the hair stylist
none of them are obviously dreads
some could maybe be dreads with a bit of imagination
lol
I still say turtle shell and hard hat
well there's an actual ninja turtle costume
GOD I HATE HICCUPS
lol
well there *hic*'s an actu*hic*al ninja tu*hic*rt*hic*le costume
stall

I'm the kind of person who laughs at people who watch soccer, but rocket league looks pretty fun
so i'm coming to vegas mid-august
like the week before your camping date (I think)
the 17th
oh rearry
for how long?
several days
up to a week i think
we must do something
indeed
I will (probably) need transportation help though, since there's no way in hell I'm doing that drive ever again without being paid for it, so alex and i are flying :P
I might be able to offer transportation help
depending on the state of my car/rental
my 30 days for the rental will be over by the end of this week
and they have kinda just started fixing my car
just now? damn
lol
well, last week
kinda
I thought they started a while ago
they started on the passenger side and realized they needed to order the driver side rail
since they damaged it while straightening it
so they have to wait for that to arrive
lol
well that sucks
yeah
lol
ETA on it being back in action?
no clue
ouch
well i'm sure we'll figure it out
I can probably borrow a car from her parents if needed
but yeah
we should definitely go to ricardos at least once
ja
and probably do something else fun as well
jajaja
jajajaja
jaja binks
jaja blinks
misa no have eyelids!
this ticket was supposed to be easy
90% copy/paste they said
it'll be fast they said
lol
"convert it from play json to spray json" they said
that's like saying "rewrite half of it"
:F
I miss writing code
I'm gonna redo Gen's website for him
as a side project
oh nice
his current website isnt very good
rearrange playboy photos - 22 hours
total time - 22 hours
lol
I told him I would need a bunch of test images
lol
but yeah, his current site doesnt work on mobile
(it's flash)
and it doesnt show up on search engines
like, at all
o.O
weird
why not?
no metadata?
it has nothing visible to search indexing bots
since it is all flash
ahh, makes sense
I have been summoned for Juror Duty o.o
DO YOUR DOODIE
but you're not american!

how you doin
pretty good
thats good
it's eric's (thor) birthday so we're having peeps over for burgers and such in a bit
you should hide a gift card in the beef of his burger
like cooked inside of it
That would be wonderful
do it
really adds a delightful crunch to the mix
yes
lol
they're frozen patties
so that'd be hard
you really should heat them up first
nah, people like them cold for some reason
people dont like eating frozen patties
no
i can speak from experience
they said they wanted hot beer and cold burgers
I want to move to somewhere called Experience
lol
so I will always speak from experience
hot beer is good, cold burgers not so much
cold chocolate is also nice on a winter night
lol
I don't see any towns or cities called experience
wat
dangit pickles!
yum pickles
no
these pickles are serialized
oh nobody likes pickling
it barely makes sense
it makes sense
it just isnt working
calling it a pickle makes sense?
well
i mean
maybe to someone
lol
that's what I meant
does calling anything anything REALLY make sense though?
does calling you a 'human' make sense?
what is a 'human' after all
we learned about it in sushil's class for practically no reason, and all I could think of is "why the fuck is it called pickling?"
what is a 'skype'
my guess:
you serialize it for transportation
just like you pickle stuff
so it lasts longer and can be transported
you're taking a cucumber and turning it into a pickle through a process called pickling
the depickling part is where that analogy dies
i think my pickling is working
but it isnt unpickling
wat
I think I need to tell everything how to turn itself in to json
which will take forever and a half
soooo
time to go home

which is good
oh nice
I had peg's
that was nice
i am still pickling
you could say that I am in quite a pickle here
quite the pickle
i feel like i spend all day waiting for code to compile
yeah
i feel like i spent half my day on reddit
and I was legitimately waiting on code to compile the entire time
So folks
U of Cal
now lets you pick from six "genders"
I would demand my gender to be attack helicopter
or I would sue
Also speaking of helis
Brandog you fix ur arma?
i will see if my arma is still broken
kk
seems to be fine now
oh?

so
i am back from taco tuesday
oh?
who else is here?
well the NSA and Microsoft are here
also the murderer living in your attic
I thought I told him to leave
seriously
I told him no more storing dead negros up there
He almost has his visa man
like a murderer would just leave
give him a break
His name was I. P. Freelie, wasn't it?
no
Don Kiddick
was his name
But CARLLLLLL, that KILLS people!!!
CARRRLLLLL
COURTNEY HAS NEVER HEARD OF THE DOORS
o.o
has she heard of the windows?
buh bum tis
or was she born in a cardboard box
how do you not hear of the doors
Probably the 2nd one
thats like never hearing of the beatles
or never seeing star wars
alex hates the beetles and has only seen most of the star wars movies once
you should start singing beatles songs to her
what was the one we kept singing?
help
halp
yes
HELP
just shout "HELP!"
and when she shows up
continue with the song
This came up because she didn't know that Twist and Shout was a beatles song
she's never heard light my fire?
or riders on the storm?
nope
I tried both
Doing a pink floyd test now
she's only "Heard" of them
<.<
lol
HOW CAN YOU HAVE YOUR PUDDEN, IF YOU DONT EAT YER MEAT!
has she heard of Rush?
they're canadian
tom sawyer drum solo OP
my parents saw Rush on saturday
OH RIGHT
good suggestion
she's never heard Aerosmith's dream on either :O
and she's only "heard" of rush O:
wHYYYYY
no music
I don't wanna miss a thing? walk this way?
she's very musically deprived
wtf does she listen to?
THATS WHAT I ASKED
lol
she says "random stuff"
brandog arma?
sure

I listen to orchestras in the car, psybient in the bath, and rock/pop/and black people rants when im walking the dogs. I listen to anything that is fast when im dancing. and then im stuck listening to annoying pop songs all day at work, and that is what ive been listening to this summer.7

guys
i need a fact about myself that nobody at my work would know
I am terrible at this sort of thing
you're a minecraft youtube celebrity
lol
you wrote tribes 2 mods and stuff
you've seen pretty much every will smith movie ever made
You think eggs are weird
there are lots of things i'm sure that your work dudes dont know lol
ooh you have (or had) a giant bag of cotton balls that you never use
lol
what a supremely uninteresting fact
lol
that's super interesting
Doctors
vgh
hiya
it's time
hey hows it going?
whaaaa that's awesome
going pretty well
Yeah :D
Nice!
that's all with an arduino and some legos
wow
Lego of the furture is nuts :P
future*
next step: https://youtu.be/pn0MenBcz_s?t=109
lol
Well in all seriousness a smaller version of these wouldn't be such a crazy idea.
need that kind of input to a VR game with an oculus
Utility mechs maybe
yeah
indeed lol
probably not far off
It's going to get interesting in the coming decades
lexus is revealing their new hoverboard on august 5 (only works on metal surfaces but still)
solution: tape a spray paint can to the front pointing towards the ground with metallic paint
haha
and another on the back with paint solvent
lol
i dont think magnetism works quite like that
no im pretty sure it does
make allsurfaces metallic!
lol
just invert the field polarity with a modulating algorithm
Don't go out in a thunderstorm though
that way it works for all surfaces
that's what they would do on stargate or start trek or any other scifi show
yup
gah now i gotta listen to that soundtrack again
o'neil inbound
I'm more than half way through the last season of SG:A :(
on my third rewatch
vgs
lol
that movie really did have a great soundtrack
I've heard they want to bring star trek back to tv, or at least something somewhat similar
good
they need to
current sci fi is lacking
Yeah, all the kids out there are missing out in vital scifi
bring back stargate universe! and atlantis!
current sci-fi is really bad
sgu just got good when they pulled the plug, but i'm happy how they ended it
Is there any current scifi?
not that I know of
i dont really watch tv though
same
sharknado is what the scifi channel plays almost exclusively
syfy*
lol ugh
>_<
lol
syfy isn't what it used to be that's for sure. Haven't seen it in ages
Hmm unable to find a good source on it, apparently cbs may be looking into bringing ST back. we'll see
Any opinions on win 10 yet?
I haven't updated
ah
I'm not opposed to updating, I just don't know if it is worth it yet
gonna wait to see what people say about it
Indeed, I understand
it's not compatible with most laptop nvidia cards, microsoft fucked that one up
they're disabling downloads if they detect those cards
that's a big issue o_O
yeah
reddit was pissed
lol
windows feels kinda bloated to me
OH
reddit was also pissed because windows solitare is freemium now
it'd be nice to have an alternative choice that actually worked with a large number of games and programs
I suppose it's the ease and habit of what we're used to
Indeed more choice and compatibility over existing infrastructure.
I feel like a new OS written from the ground up could probably make a lot of improvements over existing OSes
oh definitely
but nobody is going to do that
lol
"let me just refactor this..."
51 errors found
mfw
lol
lol
now I want to rewatch specific rim
Have you ever seen Farscape?
no
I thought that was a pretty good scifi series
specific rim is always good
godzilla approves
woooooooooo
i finished implementing my code review changes
so, the last frame rail showed up at Gaudin Ford today for my car
so they can actually start fixing it now
nice
Hi
I bought absynthe
why?
ian is a boozer :P
lol
I bought it to try it
it tastes great
not at all like alcohol
however you have to be careful
as it is actually 70% alcohol
lol
Also 1 drink a week is not a boozer
well one drink of absynthe a week is like 9 beers a week
^
^
Ian we need to have a talk
xD
lol
Okay
lets talk
Alcoholism is ruining Tony's horse's family in that one joke he tells.
Don't let it ruin yours.
9 beers a week is like a crazy college student who goes to a party or two every once in a while, and I think I speak for everyone when i say... you need to drink more
lol
x.x
lol
Want to try some while you are here?
if it doesnt taste like alcohol then sure, I'm not a huge fan of the hard stuff
We could also go to ricardos
we ARE doing that
for sure
absinthe and cilantro (puke)
cilantro :D
yummy cilantro
new minecraft snapshot today apparently
cilantro sounds good right now
yeah, mc is lookin kinda weird these days
mc is kinda not what it once was
RIP bukkit
sup
soup
soup
Did anyone do windows 10?
no
not yet
I'm not going to
for some time
if ever
apparently nvidia and microsoft worked out their problems
new driver set just came out
If ot dpesn't have any blaring issues I'll update
too lazy to fix typos
lol
I'm gonna update on my laptop for sure
windows 8 sucks
but my desktop i'm gonna wait on to see the features and stuff
I hope there aren't mountains of ads
I hate ads
the optimizations are tempting, the metro not so much
the metro is disable-able
or so i heard
up to a point
like the start menu is still metro no matter what I think
really?
idk
i'm sure that'll be fixed pronto
lol
"purpur block"

HEY TONY
HEY TONY
it's been like a year since the last mc update
and this is really not a year's worth of content
They have been too busy eating money salad
pretty much
or maybe
they just dont have enough dedotated wam
dedededeoooottaaateedddd waaaaaaaamm
happy birthday to your dad I guess?
ye
Are we gonna rent a car for camping?
I'll most likely have the mustang back by then, so i wont be able to provide transportation
Well I think we should rent a car then
we all have city cars
lol
We'll have to rent something like a Jeep Cherokee or some small SUV
well
to fit the gear
i am currently driving a jeep cherokee
I know
lol
lol
it's an alright car
some stupid stuff
but overall not bad
i have a versa
i just discovered a hidden compartment in it today
how do I make google search only return pdf files?
Versa might work
may be too small for fishing poles though
aha got it
ah good
the old site that had Ghost Love Score sheet music changed
you have to pay for all the pages now
so I found it for free on some foreign site :D
wayback machine?
oh
lol
it's a polish website apparently
er
I figured it was most likely maybe hopefully not a virus
intitle:index.of(pdf)ghost.love.score
Nightwish-Ghost-Love-Score-Piano-Arrangement-pdf filetype:pdf
the first half is the name of the pdf that is floating around the interwebs
hence the dashes
yep that's the one
RU?
thats commie
^how i format my musical research
i found an alternate version
it looks wonky though
oh it's for drums
lol
who else can be my referene
who i ask
?
for resume
referenceds
are references good?
i don't even know
normally
i just remembered that I was supposed to get business cards
but I never did
helloooooo
ello
references are normally good
no i meant business cards
but then i realized he works for a company so they make 'em
but yeah ok
Those are so 1987
at a loss though as to who i can...get referred by
i'll reference you
I am bored and nothing sounds appealing
This is a dreadful situation
we could terraria
i gotta fish
and make my biome enclosures
ok
but first I must write an email
ok
Brandon Worl
Ian
can I ask you folks to critique something?
yes
oh god resaving
just opened it and uhhhh yeah
I think it works
also I like the colour palette
SHRED IT TO PIECES
IT NEEDS TO MORE THAN WORK
IT NEEDS TO BLOW YOUR SKULL OFF
i haven't replied because my skull was blown off
....yay?
lol
I think it's good
the rules for a graphic design resume are very different than for cs/engineering stuff
so I can't really offer much specific advice on it
if it was just based on the substance and no the flash
is the writing good
organization of information
yeah, the writing seems fine
should you list skills?
that's a thought but it seems
i don't know
there's a million things I can do
and a million more I can learn
it's a nice highlight but it almost feels arbitrary
from a hiring POV I'd like to know what software you know how to use
and what skills
like wheteher or not you can do animation
ooooh good
that's a good idea thank you
np. that'll be $50
no
Brandon Worl
Ian
redikkulus
that's about as laggy as i've ever seen terraria
well he set a record for fastest time to the last wave of frost moon
i noticed
pretty smart using the birds
so
I will officially be in vegas from monday the 17th to friday the mrglgrglglglg
21st
yay
we'll have to do ricardos some time after like 6ish
sounds good to me
free game for today only
you keep it forever, but it is only free to get it for the next 24ish hours
if anyone is interested
just got hired as a support engineer at a new job :DDDDDDD
nice!
very nice!
what exactly does a support engineer do?
oh cool
scott manley showed off race the sun when it was early access a loooong time ago
looked cool
I deal with customer support and a bit of programming mostly
sweet
I need to find something for a year from now
brandog when does originate do internship applications again?
not sure
i think they'll be at the career fair
gotcha
you should look into it for meh :P
you plan on being graduated in a year right?
yeah
spring semester should be my last
then you wouldn't be looking for an internship
Yeah I guess
I have nothing on my resume other than grading an intro cs class though
yeah but internships are typically for students
they dont care about past experience much
you just have to do well in the interviews
That's not what my last interviewer said lol I got beat out just because of experience supposedly
for a different company?
yeah it was a backend for automated systems kinda thing
well there you go
different hiring philosophy
lol
yeah
i am b0r3d
i have spent all day sitting here waiting for stuff to compile >_<
I am sick
I have a throat and sinus infection
gross
yeah
its not fun
whaii
I am on antibiotics
WHAII?
Cause I work in a place sick people go to
that seems like a bad idea
Doesn't it?
you should work in a place that healthy people go to
or you could go to work in a hazmat suit
dem hazmats
patients at hospitals love seeing hospital employees walking around in hazmat suits
I am sure
lol
it shows them that the staff takes hygiene and stuff seriously
these tests take a minimum of an hour to run
and they are failing for some mysterious unknown reason
i feel like playing Injustice
wats dat
hi
hi
injustice isa thing
injustice is a fighting game with all the DC heroes/villians (well, most of them)
he played it with me when he lived here :(
this guy is nuts
so race the sun is the perfect "I'm totally busy at the front of this classroom, so you're bothering me by asking questions" game for TA/Tutoring
that is nonsense
also lol
yeah that dude is cray
too much time on his hands
must be why he made a 24h clock
to take some of it off his hands
that's like zipkrowd status in terraria
so apparently friend scores show up ingame
like
where you passed
them
lookin at you Menard
what
race against the sun
oh okay
Can we race the moon instead
fun blithring game
i like seeing nao's name further and further into the distance
lol
i am bad at these kind of games
i fucking wrecked so much at the start
i can now do two regions without tapping anything
then it gets scurry
yeah that game is hard at first
really fun though
I feel like using my joystick might be easier
Joysticks are really good for tonnes of things
.... i dunno about that
there are some moments when you need to stop turning asap
wtb: Tenor sax
anyone know anyone who used to play sax and now doesn't?
not here
darn
only missing 1 fishing quest reward to complete my cell phone :D
sounds soooo fun
I used to play sax and now don't
oh hey
unturned 3.0 is out
got a tenor?
nah, sold my alto a while back and my tenor was rented unfortunately
things are friggin expensive
You bet
my horn is worth more than a car
lol
but cars vary greatly in value
hhheeellllllllll yyyyyeeeeeaaaaahhhhhhh
i got dat cell phone
aww dayum cell phones on the computer in a video game
mid-grade sedan value
5kish?
That's mid-grade sedan?
lol
Its worth like 3x that
oh no way
wow
I think the tenor I was using was like 5k
the alto I had was like 3
My alto is a pro horn from 1948
that is probably about as silky smooth as it gets
Pretty much
You get really 2 options for horns of that quality and I have one of them
one of the guys in my band (he was horrible) had his dad's soprano, which was like 40 years old and suuuuuper nice, I wanted it
Do you know the make of it?
Can't remember
I'll look though, maybe google will jog my memory
I think it was a selmer
mine was a yamaha
well, my alto
but I think his soprano was a selmer
Selmer is a good brand
The Mark VI series is considered the best
anybody else notice that ARK has been "20% off" for the entirety of its release?
part of me wants to buy ARK
the other part of me realizes it probably won't be anything at all like what I see on youtube
yeahh
I've heard its just the laggiest shit ever
and you probably need a good server for it to be fun
and i bet good servers are hard to find
oh definitely
I'm thinking just wait for full release
early access just gives them too much of my money for what I'm getting out of it
yeah
So i played through PoE's act 4 a while ago
it's really cool
i am soooooooooooOOOOOOOOOOOO hungry
lol
waiting for food to get delivered from jasons deli
yummy
they said 12-12:30
its almost 12:30
I am reaching the end of my hungerability
FOOD IS HERE
woo
fffff
someone else in this building ordered jasons deli
it wasnt ours
hahaha
imagine if they gave it to the wrong people
and our food was lost
i would die
of starvation
ohonoez
on the bright side my build finally compiled and passed all tests
nice
after many hours of pressing the retry build button
lol
just trying over and over or fixing things in between?
i changed no code, because my code was fine. i just had to keep pushing the button every hour until it actually worked
trying over and over
lol wow
sometimes it would timeout, sometimes a compiler bug would kill it
so I'd have to rebuild without cache
which almost always timed out
FOOD
IT IS HERE
DOOF
EREH SI TI
we should kill the dungeon guardian
gl;hf
doesnt seem that hard
he has a shitton of health and can one shot you
just gotta keep moving and shooting
lol
like i said
he has 10k life
gl;hf
if you have a super high crit rate you'll get 2's on him
uh huh
so thats a bit over 5-6k shots
super fast fire rate + a straight path to run on = ezpz
you have a very interesting view on ezpz
well it is
just hold left or right, and press mouse button
hold until dead
dun
and then we get a mini dungeon guardian pet!
seeing natural motion like that in MC is weird
that's awesome
yeah
Creepy
but awesome
imagine pranking something with that
install it on a server and dont tell anyone
and pose as someone's item stand
lol
and just subtley fuck with their mind
like "I SWEAR I JUST SAW MY ARMOR STAND WAVE AT ME"
if we were still doing factions we could have armor stand spies
Factions was so 
lol
wasn't it ?
yeah i think so
My point stands
So I had today off
like no doctor in
and I spend it sick
your arument is invalid, my beard is a windmill
I am ranked #432 out of all Realistic Battle players in War Thunder
I'm ranked WAAAAY higher, you scrub
like over one million higher
I bet
I am scrub lord

what was the name of the place we decided to go camping at?
Lehman Caves
I just had a celebrity comment on my reddit post :D
(oh he's also the only commenter)
lol
i read your post
and have absolutely no idea what it said
So
My whole family now says "WHAII" when I say you know whaii?
haha
I have probably created a monster
but it will be worth it
anyone feel like helping ment and me place a billion background tiles for the boss arena?
I would help but I am gonna get sushi
If you're not done when I'm back I will
okie
enjoy your raw fish
I will
I will also have cooked fish
Back
my food was good
lol
we finished it already
have you tested it?
not yet
still adding the side walls
password
?
and then i gotta add the actual things to use for cover/regen/stuff inside of it
no pass

just had a guy rage so hard that i beat him last second in hearthstone that he added me as a friend, told my I was a "fucking lucky noob player shit" and that he "hope u die", then he un-added me, then he RE-added me just to say "your mom's my bitch"
and then he un-added me again
lmao
How kind
i have three 300px*300px boxes, with a 5px margin. I am trying to put them 3 wide in a 930px wide container
and they dont fit
they do fit in a 938px container though
and idk where the 8px comes from
Can you just use a 938px containter then?
well yeah
but i want to know why it isnt fitting
Its called a pixal tax
when you think you've done something right, it charges you a little more.
Or your margins are wrong
i checked them with the inspecter
Re-inspect them
or reduce all the margins to 4
and see if that fixes it
so if the box is 936px tall, it can hold 3
if it is 936 wide, it cant
what program are you using?
a text editor
and html
lol
lol
Going hardcore eh?
this is how I always do web design
WYSIWYG editors produce crap HTML
That's true
But at least WYSIWYG is WYSIWYG
meister and I accidentally made an auto glowing mushroom farm last night
Someone should make a new WYSIWYG editor which produces nice HTML
wat
it is... interesting
apparently glowing mushrooms will still grow on actuated soil
and immediately uproot themselves
pretty sure that's a bug
definitely
I wonder if that works on anything other than mushrooms
if it works on strange plants that would be wonderful
kinda hard to test though
we need to build that space farm for strange plants
eventually yeah
there's a few missed spots of crimson/hallow that need to be patched
On the right?
yeah
Still?
How'd we miss them?
are the guns not as effective as we thought?
must have missed a piece and it spread
they're pretty effective, but if it spreads quickly inbetween doing one tunnel and the next, it is possible for it to go beyond the range of the 2nd spray
Ah true
blah whatever 938px will work >_<
blahhhh

I have discovered that Gen has no clue whatsoever how to use email
he alternates which of my email accounts he sends mail to
and never keeps an email going. every thing it is a new email
and he fills them full of emoticons
and can't spell anything
and doesn't read what i say
and makes no sense
lol
but hes not paying me for this website
so
i can just ignore all that and do whatever i want
well that's good
if he gets too annoying just be all "playboy or riot"
lol
tony
if you're still dealing with getting a contact form to work on your website
i might be using one of the methods listed there for Gen's website
meow
So i'm officially good to graduate may  as long as Bebis gets me into networking or finds a replacement (i'm waitlisted)
woo
ye
networking was pretty useless when I took it
like the amount of information I left that class with could have been covered in 2-3 weeks
I'm sure it's still useless, but sadly it's required
it's still shamik teaching it
we went over a LOT of stuff, but almost none of it stuck lol
i crammed 2-3 hours before the tests
got an A, then promptly forgot it all
the funny part is I sent him an email saying "i'm waitlisted, need this class to graduate, and it's not offered in spring" and he's like "unfortunately the class is full, you're waitlisted, and the class isn't offered in spring but if people drop then you can get in"
all I really remember from it is some routing/packet stuff
lol
so he basically copy/pasted your email back to you
literally regurgitaed my information, yes
haha
yeah and I get to forward his response to bebis to show that I already tried talking to the prof to get in
Maybe you can do an independent study thing
where you just learn it on your own but show up for tests
That'd be cool
I'd love that
Nolan did that for programming languages, but that was due to a schedule conflict rather than the class being full
that sounds like a preferrable method of taking that class
and networking
especially networking
well, now I have something to hope for
networking was mostly powerpoint
there was some stuff on the board in the 2nd half of the class
timing diagrams or something
I hate timing diagrams
like
they're the bane of my existance
i feel like i am merging networking with something else in my head
probably
hmmm yes i think so
or 2xx
whatever that last one was
that you took
the one that mircea usually teaches
481?
nah, the one I took with egbert
oh
uhh
mips and such
yeah
idk
lol
lol
oh yeah
the one mircea teaches wasnt offered so I had to take 301
with some other thick accented person
lol
better or worse than mircea?
well the replacement is supposedly waaay easier than the one mircea taught
it was a typical cpe class where you half pay attention and kinda do somewhat well in
lol
whereas mircea's was apparently hard and required work or you fail
but anyways
i am looking in to static website generation
and I really hope Gen doesn't want any dynamic content
because then I can finish this website in like half the time it would take to use Rails or Sinatra
btw, do you have any ideas for your senior project yet?
no clue
i just resorted to having a contact info sheet where if they really wanted to they could email me
but that is neat
lol
i really want to make a static compiled website now
but oh my god
also what is a static compiled website
you can do cool stuff
and then it compiles to basic html/css/js
ooh
and you just upload those
cool stuff like having data in YAML or JSON, then parsing it in the html
works well for blogs and portfolios
IF you have the know-how to modify the site for updates
but since Gen has the technical ability of this bottle cap on my desk, I will need to make a dynamic site that doesn't need changes to be compiled and reuploaded between updates
with like a drag/drop system and big easy to identify labels
Hi folks
Hello Ian?
Late work day
da
Had to do overtime
da komrade
I see all your stealth edits
They are still quite stealthy
I am the master of edit
it is so freaking trendy
i just want to use it!
i also learned I can have a free website at naosyth.github.com
which is a perfectly acceptable url for a programmer's portfolio website to be located at
because it is github
you see this?
apparently only effects some of github's projects, but thats some crazy language
dafuq does racism have to do with github
Click their OP link
"Our open source community prioritizes marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort. We will not act on complaints regarding:
   ‘Reverse’ -isms, including ‘reverse racism,’ ‘reverse sexism,’ and ‘cisphobia’
   Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone,” “go away,” or “I’m not discussing this with you”
   Refusal to explain or debate social justice concepts
   Communicating in a ‘tone’ you don’t find congenial
   Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions"
dah hell is wrong with you internet
Other people who have signed onto that policy
My reaction was the same as yours to start with
Maining wondering how in hell you'd be racist on github
i dont even
exactly
Well
Imma make Whitehubgit
White programmers only
i feel like i am missing something here
I've been trying to figure it out as well
eh whatever
lol
i dont interact with people on github
sjws on the rise?
i just push code and bash my face on my desk when CircleCI fails to build
That's my point, how many people in the tech community would even care enough for such a thing to be written
Brandon is a fine example of 99% of github users
[6:56:59 PM] Anthony Humphreys: sjws on the rise?
Possibly
get your rifles ready
Don't worry, if worst comes to worst, you can out run their mobility scooters
Also: Brandon
That middleman looks super nice
and trendy
super 100% trendy
so trendy
So trendy it could be San Fransico approved
lets me use partials without a bunch of bloat
and the deployed site is literally as lightweight as possible
also i18n and LESS
Don't you like bloat though?
no
Everyone likes bloat
You need everything you will never need in one package!
but alas I can't use Middleman for this website
Tell me whaii
stuff and things
specific/specific
you need to be 1% technically capable to update it
only 1%
only 1%
thats 1% too much
Will .75% do?
nope
Darn
welp
gen hosts his website on godaddy
godaddy doesnt support ruby
10/10 Gen
Gen must be short for Genius
welp
welp
weeeee!
wat
weeee
woooo
weeeee wooooo
I am an abulance
That will be $1400 please
You cant have my money >.>
You guys should update war thunder and play with me ;(
mmmm
i want those cookies
warrrrr thunder :(
volunteer work in resume, yea or nay?
ehhhhh
if it is relevant maybe
also war thunder
Brandon
and Tony
Are we still good for operation camping?
Brantony Humphworl
yarp
youtube changed their playback bar ui
yeah
tony
we should build halloween costumes again
volunteer work only if relevant and recent
nobody cares what you did 10 years ago
I want a custom home-built halloween costume
I once helped an old lady cross the side walk
it'd give me an excuse to actually do halloween
I have been looking back in to foam costume making
that sort of stuff
jesus christ
did you see the new youtube player?
yes
it's... pretty
yeah I like it
me 4
man, the next button even shows the thumbnail for the episode it links
so does anyone here follow golf even a little bit or has followed golf in the past?
i know of tiger woods' existence
lol
tiger is so 
i heard there's another black guy in golf
on NPR
like 2 or 3 days ago
I know not of this dark fellow
that's news
anyway
John Daly
he was playing slots at the El Dorado tonight
we saw him and many other pros
there's a tournament near mount rose and the El Dorado is hosting the players
did you say hi?
nah, he was in the high roller area
If you walk in there you immediately feel poor
I didnt want to feel poor
lol
yep, that's my story
oh and I lost 100 bucks
blackjack is a bitch
well
those giant casinos don't pay for themselves
lol
actually they kinda do
it was my dad's money
yeah they really do
lol
whelp, tim fo bed
night
night
the weather here this summer has just been insane. in-sane.
we just got pummeled by so much hail its piled up on the cars and it looks like Christmas.
at least it isnt outsane
the roads are all flooded.
from now on I am going to refer to normal/average things as being outsane
and when its not doing shit like this we keep getting huge funnels
I wish it would rain hard here again
forest fires have been really bad too :(
what's a funnel?
Tornado that doesn't touch ground
guess what a funnel is called when it touches the ground?
well i guess that's better than getting huge tornados
a tornado?
lol
ding
its really bad for the airport though
canada is clearly an inhospitable environment
you should live in vegas, where it is a smooth 43* C
Im just glad I got home before the roads flooded
my little car is awesome but im pretty certain that it is not also a submarine or a boat
my rental jeep handles flooded roads pretty well
as long as it's only like a few inches
lolol
my mustang definitely couldn't have handled those roads
you know why?
because the front end is taken apart
but also because the water would have gotten in bad places
it feels like winter
lol
Hi everyone
Hi decosone
Hallo Brandron
you know
that design really makes no sense
Actually it works really well
i imagine it wouldnt work too well irl
Its basically a four point forward swept canard design
so it could work in theory
the more traditional tie fighter definitely makes 0 sense though
I made one of those
in Kerbal as well
They don't work well
lol
They require like 30% of all their thurst to vector just to not fall out of the sky
and forget manuevering in more that 2 dimensions at once
just not gonna happen
dude's a craftsman
Who?
you
anyways
foamguy
looks like Gen is going with a Squarespace website instead
because of simplicity
which means I am free to make my own Middleman website :D
woot?
Brandon Worl
Ian
Brandon Worl
Ian
the mustang's frame is repaired :D
I think the guy who wrote this article about semantic HTML played Tribes
he named a div "shazbot"
lol
shozbat
my car is also fix
well
mine is done
yours is getting there
what did you have done to your car?
catalytic converter went bonkerz
ah
they just have to put my front suspension and engine back in
and a new hood, side panels, and stuff
just this
and this and this and this
and that
lol
lol
1-2 weeks to finish the repair
not bad
they're giving me another $250 towards my rental
that's nice
so the originate attack starts tomorrow
oh nice
whatcha doing this time?
lake las vegas
meetings
food
pool
same as last time basically
sounds like fun
except we have an actual hotel instead of a mansion
aww
lame
so instead of 10-20 people to a room it is 2 people
lol
nah much better
or also a yacht
oh*
nice
I'm once again out of tickets to work on
so I am bored
no mas tickets
hello
Hello
HEllo
HeLLo
HELLO
myello
you're bored
i had redonk OT
10 minute lunch
stayed an extra our
D:
brain dead
well imma be at work for like 30 straight hours tomorrow!
Brandohg and Tony
We should dicuss a car rental for the trip
Cause I want at least one person to cosign the rental agreement
lol
they're coming for you tony
lol
can't go a single day without seeing one of those fuckers
well i think where we're camping is a minion free zone
Hopefully
I'll lend you my gun if we see one though
brb 1 sec
kk
ok back
so what's the purpose of cosigning?
In case something goes wrong
lol
or one of us some how became incapacitated
stuff like that
lol
Actually maybe we don't need to rent
looking at the map, the road up the camp site is 100% paved
my parents are weary about letting me cosign lol
but by the time we go camping I'll either still have the jeep, which we could take, or I'll have my mustang which would be ill-suited for the trip
We could just take a regular car
clearly the mustang is out
lol
We'll have to have enough room for the stuff though
and we have to organize how we all will be getting in 1 car and going
since I like 20 minutes south of you guys
Also brandon there is the fishing info
We'll have to buy you and me, and tony, if he wants, a one day fishing pass in ely
I have everything else
thats fine
I'll catch the biggest trout ever
and break all the records
Look at all those fishing holes
before retiring from fishing
The more remote ones will have the largest fish
this licensing website is very crappy looking
it made me feel like i was playing altis life
buying a license from a shoddy looking GUI
A license for what?
fishing
We'll do that at the store in ely
I'm looking at the licensing site
Don't buy them online
They come on fancy government paper
do we have to take a class?
No
lol
the website requires you to take a class
10/10 rippoff
State record brown Trout, caught at Cave Lake (where I fish) is 27lbs 5ounces and 33" long
Think you can beat that?
psh
child's play
i have done so many fishing quests
I'll just toss some master bait on my rod
and go to town on those fish
Oh the park also has brook trout and rainbow
one sec
i'll blow their minds
Trout, Rainbow
16                30.5         Ruby Lake NWR
That's 16lbs for a rainbow
30.5"
Brook trout is the smallest breed
Record is 5lbs 10oz
22.8"
I'll just shoot one with my bow and arrow
and pull it in
Are you going to bring your bow?
i wasnt planning on it
lol
oh okay
no comments tony?
i'm down to fish
how much do licenses cost?
i have no equipment
one day permits are like $12 I think
I can bring the equipment
I'm just concerned about having a vehicle large enough for that + our gear
you guys have tents yes?
please tell me they are compacts
i have some sort of tent like structure hiddein in my attic somewhere
i also have a taco tent
and my brother has tents
ah gonna borrow one?
probably
I think his ones are all big enough for 2-4 people
my taco tent is a single person tent
but it kinda leaks if it rains
I have an REI compact tent with a rain cover
Does Tony have a tent?
If he doesn't I can cover his tent needs
I don't mind sharing a tent too
Plus we need space for a cooler
to hold our food
and space for some firewood
which we can buy in Ely
i have fire wood
Oh
That works
We still need space for it
yeah
i have a 10x10 canvas tent
but it is that
canvas
not a nice pop tent
we can share a tent if you want tony
it'll save space anyways
(i promise not to keep you up like the days of old)
so he says
If I cleaned out my trunk I could probably haul the stuff
and tony has a hatchback
lol
i'm down for tent sharing
shares body warmth
50/50 chance I won't get eaten too
technically it isnt a 50/50 if ian has his own tent
if ti attacks our tent
50 it's you
50 its you, 50 its me, 50 its both, 50 its neither
Attack my tent I dare you attacking thing
lol
be gone foul thing!
the comments section stings
Mustank
knock knock
who's there
Mine
It is infact my there
mine who
well
That's 2 mistakes
lol
Lets call the joke dead and leave it
ok
ugh
dude
You'd think they'd design those better
Compensating.
Fucked up car.
Hit people.
Bonafide fucktard
lol
Yes the crash was caused by over-compensating
A common stearing mistake
the hell is mustang week
dunno
Its the prelim matches for the Darwin Awards
how many lightbulbs does it take to change a lightbulb?
Just one, this is an intervention
interventions require an intervening party
I thought you were quoting that comic
TIL brandon is tossing master bait on his rod
yeah
you're officially a master baiter
congrats
if i'm lucky i get a fish on the end of my rod too
...yummy?
lol
u w0t
apparently youtube doesnt do the 301+ views thing any more
hm?
the view counter doesn't stall for a while after passing 300 views for a video
oooh
you figure that out because of your latest video you put up?
:P
no
lol
you fellas take a look at empyrion? it looks decent but I cant decide if it'll be good or not
(when it comes out, no early access for me)
it looks exactly like space engineers
but it already has planets
SE will have planets eventually
SE already has them by extension of ME
u w0t
lol
i am back
i left the attack early
lol why?
my roommate snores
Good reason
all that was left was an hour on a yacht and a boat race tomorrow at 8 am
row boat?
yeah
i wasn't participating, just watching
2 erly 2 row
so no real incentive to go
yes
lol
that's why I didnt sign up
my roommate snored SO loud
he actually dual-snored
he had two snoring patterns going on at once
i grabbed my earphones at 2:30 am and downloaded a white noise app
I had to use "extra heavy rain" on max volume
loooooooool
it did let me sleep though
i did fall alseep on one of our meetings today though
we had 10 hours of meetings
today
several more hours yesterday
the tl;dr could have been condensed in to two hours without any significant content loss
lol wow
sounds like tons o fun
So, I am bored
anyone want to do something?
sure
lemme grab some water first
back
we could terraria! I dug the remaining tunnels on the left side of the map
trying to get mythical on last prism is brutal

I had a burrito
I had a discussion/arguement with my family while I ate said burrito
lol
about what?
lol global warming
They claim it outright doesn't exist
x_x
They also like Trump
X_X
And they're right "Global Warming" doesn't exist
However
Global Climate Shifting and Ocean tempeture rise does exist
And there is evidence for that all over
Apparently people that measure ocean surface temperature averages are biased
and change data to suit themselves
so say my parents
I just ignore people who deny climate change
lol
Its not like you can look at numbers and long term shifts in weather patterns and detrmine things are changing bases on areas retaining more heat
That would just be biased
(sarcasm is implied)
Yessss
( ಠ ͜ʖರೃ)
so
rocket league is totally worth 20 bucks
ehhh
I'm not bad at it either
sports game
exactly
so cool people who aren't evil will like it
Sports games are so 
it's 100% skill
and I love that
(ノಠ益ಠ)ノ彡┻━┻
Steam store is still derp
yeah
lots of people are affected
COMPLAIN MORE
and maybe they'll fix it?
Us, LA, and Phoenix? That's like all of the important areas in the whole country
lol
Looks like Honolulu too
lol
never
gets
old
i am debating trying out arch linux
but it looks like a lot of work to install
not sure if worth
I've tried it
on a VM
its meh
It's much more light weight than ubuntu
Massively
which would be nice
like hugely
yeah ubuntu has gotten kinda bloated
It might be a bit too lightweight though
i dont want to have to deal with wrangling drivers together to be able to use my laptop's track point and stuff
That's why I didn't like it
I had some driver issue and decided it wasn't worth fighting
lol
Debian would probably work out of the box
but it doesnt seem much more lightweight than Ubuntu
just use debian?
+GNOME
nah
if you need desktop enviroment
i dont like gnome
I'm planning on using Awesome
link?
alternatively Cinnamon but I've already used it a bit and something new would be nice
it's a tiling window manager
"Features and non-features"
lol
lol
A few people at work use it
it seems nice
It would be nice if my laptop actually had a 1080p screen
What does it have?
lots of customization
and tiling
no
your laptop
oh
lol
1600x900 i think
lol
I want a cocktail
what should I make?
I don't have vodka so please leave out cocktails that require vodka
how about
vodka cranberry
<.<
peppermint wasn't horrible, we had it on the cpe lab computers
you mean cinnamon?
it was definitely peppermint
maybe an old version or something?
there's mint and there's cinnamon
idk about anything called peppermint
Two Jews, Morty and Saul, are out one afternoon on a lake when their boat starts sinking. Saul says to Morty, "So listen, Morty, you know I don't swim so well." Morty remembers how to carry another swimmer from his lifeguard class when he was just a kid, so he begins tugging Saul toward shore.
After ten minutes, he begins to tire. Finally about 100 feet from shore, Morty asks Saul, "So Saul, do you suppose you could float alone?"
Saul replies,"Morty, this is a heck of a time to be asking for money!"
guess its a thing
yeah
lol
why did they use peppermint?
seems kinda random
yeah idk, I think he mentioned something about egbert wanting to try it
they were all dual booted with XP
u w0t m8
i have no clue how to use Awesome
lol
I'm running it directly on top of x11
which may have been a bad decision
do you have enough wam?
i do
is it dedditated?
well I only gave the VM 512MB
but that is enough
It need at least 
moar wam
i broke it
x11 wont start any more
that didnt take long
mor wam
WHAM
brandone get rocket league and play with me

i am installing debian again for like the 10th time
and eating
why the tenth time?
well first time I didnt select a desktop environment

third time i selected it fully but decided i'd rather just not run a desktop environment
so now I am reinstalling without a desktop environment
waddafak

it was super good
Derktrs
hi
Want to play something this evening
maybe
I'm trying to figure out how to change my terminal color scheme in debian
it is all black and white which is ugly
ewww
I don't remember the command
it was grey and then i rebooted and it was ugly
woo! got it!
wooo

war thunder?
arma?
Terraria?
Golf?
no?
I'm trying to figure out why this theme isn't working entirely
it's supposed to have a fancy clock widget
but it is missing
whaiii
Did you get your clock?
no
whai not?
golf
golf is fun
it is break time from debian
golf time
it is mostly working now though :D
or something time
well
we could do a little terraria
imma get off at 11 though
okay
gonna open the server?
it is up
nvm
Brandon Worl
Ian
Brandon Worl
Ian
ohai
hi
what is that a map of
terraria
progress on cleansing the world
lol cleansing
?
removing crimson and hallow
they spread over your entire world
so
ian and I had things to ask you
let me see if I can remember what they were
for camping, do you think we should rent a car? or is your vehicle capable?
if we rent we'd each pay for 1 day of the rent
oh also
have you considered playing Rocket League?
oh he hasnt just considered playing
he's GOING to
100%
he promised
that's what his spirit animal told me in my dream at least
or something like that
oh awesome, that's great news
yeah I know right? great message to recieve spiritually
i've always considred playing rocket league
looks fun as hell
get it yo
i'd be okay with my car provided people pitched in for gas
it's legit
can your car carry tents, fishing gear, other gear, food, fire wood, and people?
we can buy food at ely
so if we have to balance that on ian's head for the last hour of driving thats fine
the biggest thing is gonna be the fishing gear if your tents collapse nicely
that and firewood
how big is fishing gear?
i have almost 0 fishing experience
well, poles are about six feet, but can collapse to about 3/4
feet
they're just long
and you don't want them squished
also I can do a round or 3 of rocket league at lunch time if you're available
working from home today
oh hellz yeah
I'm down whenever
noon ish
hippos and I did some ranked yesterday night after you left, and we killed it
he's pretty damn good
ofc you did
lol
I wasnt there
lol
you can only do 2v2 ranked
with a team
dont worry, I'll make sure to balance your success with equal or greater failure
3v3 is solo entry
lol
nah, you're not bad :P
3 people
we can store things in my car
it's not a truc
but
collapsible hatchback
nissan verSA 07
but if we do that i wilL REALLY need help on gas
well, if you think we can fit stuff, we can take it
yeah
we'll split gas
3 way
you should probably have room in that
depending on how many tents
say you lay those down in the trunk (smallish ones will fit), pile some wood on top of them, use most of the back seat and people's laps, then you'll have room
if you could tie things to the roof it'd be ezpz
laps could be uncomfortable for a 4ish hour drive
yeah
well if you put the large half of the back seat down
then you'll have lots of room for large ites
yeah
but
if you have more than one large ice chest
or want to bring more than two nights of firewood
then you'll need laps
(source: am packing expert)
lol
nao we once drove 4 people out in a nissan with tents and hiking equipment
we will be fine
sounds good
you know what isnt good though? when your code that worked stops working
and goes unnoticed for a week
true
that would not be good
it isnt in master, it's still on my dev branch
but i have no clue why it stopped
>_<
GGs
tony: does your trunk look like this?:
yes
then yeah you'll have plenty of room probably
my dad likes to overpack firewood
just find a felled tree and bring an axe
he has an axe
and a shovel
or maybe just a shovel
i dont remember
lol
bring an axe
even if it's just a hatchet
you can get a day or so of firewood in an hour or two
without the cool stripes
and that double seat ont he left is collapsible
so people can sit passenger rear and we have all tha tspace
we will be FINE
coo
but yeah you should totally get Rocket League
so that I can cause you to lose too :D
lol great
its soooo fun
especially when you play with people you know
because then if they fuck up you can yell at them
;P
RL sooN?
maybe
helping someone out with their code
gimmie 10 minutes to try to find this bug
my hunger grows too strong to keep debugging much more
speaking of hunger
i'm hungry
time moves more slowly while microwaving
lol rly tho
its so true
turns out we invented slow-time machines years ago
we just need bigger microwaves
with slower timers
ok
im ready
imma be eating while we play
lol
ok
skype call?
sec
Brandon Worl
Brandon Worl
the elusive bug has been solved!
what would be a cool set of sci-fi armor to build
i feel like im not a very big mass effect fan
so im not sure about doing that
I don't think there's anything cooler than the chief's armor
even just the helm
but it is done so often
and the helmet is the hardest part
lol
so is everything else lol
wait
let me show you my fear
that is good quality work
but it has massive bobble head syndrome
as does almost every chief cosplay
gotta mold your head first
just watch a video on armor fitting and you'll be good
could be cool
or something similar
just make yourself a set of power armor from fallout, and finish it in time for release of fallout 4 for massive karma
but im not a big fallout fan
why not?
i have spent about 1 hour playing fallout new vegas
and thats it
gotta play em all
pokemon
lol this french dude is getting so pissed at his teammates
I am now the proud owner of a 1957 Conn Tenor Saxophone
Im visiting Vegas again.
To deliver money to me?
>.>
ooh when?
from the 17th to the 23rd?
nnuuuu
the 23rd to the 30th xD
of september
that includes both my court date and my birthday!
Did you ever find out that first fine?
no
We must go for your birthday dinner! :D
lol
Whats a birthday?
a celebration of having completed another orbit around the sun
I thought it was for surviving the great squeeze.
Nothing like those trips around the sun right?
Anyone want to play a game?
I am attending the tribes con mod reunion
lol
How are you attending?
in game
someone who knows the name thief was here
they were like "someone took your name on PSN btw"
lol
sup
brandog
quick
i have like an hour to RL
lol
tony
quick
dl it
play with me
hurry
no time
$?
hm
totally worth tho
i am recreating Hybrid Construction, tony
just for old time sake
...
RLRLRLRLRL
with what
what
the API
that's the guild name?
api?
thyth apparently released the tribe api
there's no gui for it though
oh
so I'm just doing it by hand
?
soooooo
Hybrid Construction
was that a mod?
...
thought that was a clan
it was our clan
lol
the API is for making clans and such
ohhhhh
I got a UE :D
aha! the people on the Punished Props live stream mentioned me!
and pronounced my name correctly
they were like "Naosyth has been here for 12 hours" in a kind of confused way like "why would you be here for 12 hours"
lol what
stream?
when are you mentioned
uhh
like 6 minutes ago
lol
only 2 hours
nice guy
nicely done
I have decided I am going to make the standard mass effect armor
because it is pretty simple
the shapes are, at least
good luck guy
hello
hi
so apparently not all cars are the same in RL
oh no way
yup
hitbox or something?
some of them drift differrntly, and their hitboxes are different
and some other less major differences
interesting
I've been sticking with the venom cause it feels good to me
yeah
the differences seem pretty minor
some cars do turn significantly faster while drifting though
is the venom one of the faster ones? it seems like it
venom is mid-tier
interesting
his tests aren't very controlled though
nor complete
looks like it
still, the drifting info is nice
same with the kickoff info
apparently you can do online splitscreen
o.o
like, splitscreen and play online
yes
or two people both online playing on split screens for no reason
lol
yeah i noticed people doing that a while ago
there can be a naosyth and a naosyth(2)
and 3 and 4
yep
so tocks would be correct if you, tony, and I were playing on your computer
lol
lol
dunno if you can watch streams at work or not, but kronovi (#1 player) is streaming right now
twitch username is camgears
link?
doing a 24hr stream just seems unpleasant
me looking at ultrawide 1440p monitor prices: http://i.imgur.com/oo9MZ40.gif
lol
yeah too much computer for me
24 hours that is
this guy is a friggin amazing flyer
the mustang should be 100% finished with repairs some time between friday this week and tuesday next week :D
they have the engine and suspension put back. The new hood will get in tomorrow morning and then it's off to the paint place
woo
Sup folks?
nada
you??
I am just looking at the games steam recommends for me
none of which am I interested in
me either
lol
rocket league is too good
all I need
All you need is a soccer with rc cars game?
basically
it's so fun
and competitive
the competition is the best part
Does being intellegent give you a massive advantage over other players?
and/or can you play as Nazis/Imperial Japanese
yes, and no
being intellegent allows you to skillfully make moves
you have to have the right kind of intellegence though
and reflexes
lol
TONY PLAY WITH ME
BRANDON YOU TOO
it helps as much as being intelligent helps with soccer
nuh uh
it's much more skillful than soccer
you can't just fall down and say ow to win games
hmm true
cmoncmoncmonletsplay
people literally get blown up in this game and dont even cry
^
i can play a bit
there is no button for crying
idk if we're going to taco tuesday though
if we are i'll have to stop
pshh
RL > tacos
I NEED MAH TACOS OKAY
IRL tacos < RL tacos
I NEED MY GUAC. I NEED MAH TACOS. I GOTTA HAVE THEM AT ALL TIME!
lol
but a little dab'll do ya
it still kills me that he was so terribly white, but when he said that I could completely imagine him as a black man
anyway
lol
RLRLRLRL
ok lets do it
Brandon Worl
Ian
Brandon Worl
Ian
hihihi
hellohellohello
vghvghvgh
vgawvgawvgaw
gawgawgaw
whatcha doin?
wagwagwag
looking at the materials I have to buy
well i'd start with the palladium
wait
I was thinking uranium
why the hell did you not decide on ironman suit
overdone
complicated
you already have the helmet though
lol
half a helmet
half a derpy helmet
hi
hi
hi
did you buy rocket league yet?
why would he buy it again
lool
was having two trains of thought right then
tony you have to buy it TWICE
no :(
just once
apparently it was free like a month ago
and we missed it
so
more rocket league?
yes in 1 sec
what waws free
RL was free a month ago
rl
oh was it really
real life
rocket league
yeah
lol
no, real life is IRL
no, IRL is in real life
NO
BAD
YES
GUD
RL NEEDS ITS OWN ABBREVIATION
RoL
fine
RoL
HOW ABOUT
ROCKET LEAGU
lol
RktL
Rekt league
totally read that in a super asian accent
ROkettu LEEEEEEEGooh
btw alex is watching a show so i'll probably be muted for your ear's sake
so when are you going to buy it tony
^^^
when it's not $20
so when they up it to 25
?
:F
seriously?!
waiting for sale sthen
nah, the first dlc comes out soon though
the 13th
it's just $20
i found out you can play WoW for free on private servers
dont eat food for 2 days
^
lol
and it'll balance out
also dont do WoW tony
it will make you less likely to do RL
it's a soul sucker
lol li've heard
being a paid subscritpion is what made me not buy into it
but it's free
it is too much
if I were to play it I would not stop until I thoroughly beat it
to a bloody pulp
rocket league is more fun
so I refrain
lol
that takes like 100+ hours
so that's probably best
More than that I bet
I have 250+ in terraria
I dont even want to know what I have in MC
you can insta-jump to lvl 70
per the private server
that is cheating and would make it not feel like an accomplishment
but then you miss all the early game
you can beat it faster etc. etc.
i'm not gonna but it's an option
meh
lame
RLRLRLRLRL
RLRLRLRL
cmoncmon
must finish resume
you have been working on your resume for like 3 months
this could be you tony
lol i've seen the plays
and they are absolutely nuts
but i must finish this resume first
Brandon Worl
Courtney Boyle
Ian
Brandon Worl
Courtney Boyle
Ian
holy crap
i can do free shipping or $230.56 shipping
on an $82.04 purchase
haha wow
I'd choose the free one
pls
over half a million views now
not bad
it was at like 100k when we first watched it
oh god
the turtle song
this is mah turtel sawng
I might upgrade my laptop to windows 10
to give it a try
maybe it will stop being so slow
i can smell my laptop melting
damn: http://www.theguardian.com/world//aug/12/explosion-chinese-port-city-tianjin?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_BaconReader
looks like pepcon here in the 80s
the one in china seems larger
I think its the angle
and the buildings
That area is now tons of houses in Henderson
the DMV is there now
Also did you get to the part where the underground storage goes off?
yeah
It registered as a medium earthquake
lol
magnitude?
3.5
3.6
Somewhere in there
ah the china one was 2.3 and 2.9
it was at a port though
on a shipping boat
yeah
i believe
Yeah at least the henderson one was empty at that time
There is a park in the crater now
lol
Its really nice
lol
Featuring a 31 acre lake!
(not for swimming)
I wonder how that hole got there
I wonder why its not for swimming
i still think the china explosion looks bigger
Why dad was on top of a boiler at the power plant that day
He told me the whole boilder jumped in the air
lmao why is that video you linked tagged as comedy
maybe it is just more fire-bally
the pepcon explosion was apparently about equal to one kiloton of tnt
and the tianjin explosion is estimated currently to be around 21 tons of tnt
Wonder what caused it
That explosion also blew out my boss's windows in green valley
damn green valley is pretty far from tianjin
not there
lol
lol
China has industrial accidents all the time
US its much rarer
apparently the first atomic bomb we dropped was 700 times stronger than the tianjin explosion
that's quite a bomb
Yes
The Tsar Bomba was 51 megatonnes
that explosion really didnt look very large
a nuke would have vaporized the person standing in that window
well yeah
but that explosion totally dwarfed those buildings
that's true
RL?
sure
woo
Brandon Worl
Anthony Humphreys
you folks list volunteer work on your resumes?
Nope
Though I swear this conversation has already been had
lol
Brandon Worl
Anthony Humphreys
if it's relevant and recent, then yes
otherwise no
that's what candice said anyway
we did have this conversation
monday last week
lol
tony it feels like you are always working on your resume
i just did a search and this exact same time last year we were talking about resumes
because I always hate my fucking job
lol
i wonder if I just have a yearly "fuck this" cycle
I think Originate is starting to push design a bit more again. They mentioned it briefly at the Attack
I can put your name forth
plz plz plz plz plz plz plz
plz
i have resume
lol
I'll ask some people how you can apply tomorrow
I think if you apply through the formal means, whatever those are, you wont get lost like last time
I would hope so
not  that giving the CEO your card isnt a good way to get in
but apparently it doesnt work
lol
how are your illistrator skills?
er
spelling
illustrator
illuminati
i live on it
any experience doing something like quick prototyping of an app UI?
yis
it was only one app
lemme pull up a few pics
ok
of something a senior design guy made
in the group activity during the attack
imgur is ded
i'll dl it
imgur perm or temp dead
PERMDED
y
no moar $$$?
APOCALYPSE
ah
oh wow
is dead
is ded
idk why
anyways tony
the context on those images is
wow that is highly doable
we were given a problem, ours was the fact that if I tell you somewhere is 20% humidity and 79 degrees, you dont really know what that feels like
so we had 30 minutes to discuss the problem
that's awesome
30 minutes to uhh
paper prototype
and an hour to make an actual thing
so design guy made those during that last hour
ezpz
while the dev people threw together an html slideshow thing
because we were like "we'll make an html version of the UI!" and then we had 10 minutes left so we just made it a slideshow of the actual design images
>_<
lol
but that chart doesnt cover the numbers I said
I know
but somewhere out there
A government employee
needs to be sacked
that is cool though
how it feels in buffalo
look at the image again
smart
100F @ 75% humidity
Sack him now
Whoever he is
lol
100@75 is a black hole
very small
black dot
alone
by itself
with no purpose
tis a crime
It ruins the whole graph
honestly I think it gives the graph character
How dare you
it's probably some guy, who had this great great uncle, who perished at exactly 100F 75%, and it's his homage to his memory
anyway
brandoge
if you want to continue
I can
yes
ok
it must be done
1sec
riley is here
so i had to close the door
at least ridley scott isnt there
Brandon Worl
nao
do you have a color printer
shit rocket league
uh
yes
but
no ink
....ffffffffffffffffffffffffeck
Brandon Worl
plz critique thx
As someone who has to go through several resumes everyday - I liked it, nothing raised any red flags and I would be honoured to contact your references good sir!
. . .thank you
well nao
looks good
the order of work history seems a little weird
since it isnt chronological
order by relevance is better
courtney has spoken
and so it shall be done
lol the end date is chronological
but thank you
i lied
i so lied
courtney has spoken
thus it is
the degrees are weird to me
Courtney is a false prophet
if you dropped graphic comms to the next line and added a descriptor to the AB then it'd make more sense to me
I never claimed to be a prophet.
the task was thrust upon me.
I like thing to be in chronological order
and so do computers
computers dont have preferences
programmers have preferences
programmers do though
aww
wow
lol
beat me to it
wow
wow
lol
you know what I meant
wow
wow
wow
wooooOOoooOOOwwww
and now he's gonna miss my comment :F
But human resources are not normally programmers.
unsure of what descriptor to add to ab
originally it was below the AS
ab in b
but that looked weirder
Ian says I wont need a sweater in september
you wont
But he said I wouldn't need one in January and, I still occasionally preferred one
I mean what do people wear if not sweaters?
You don't need a sweater here
I litterally own 1
only
what a shame
I bet you look good in sweaters
Which gets worn to a Christmas party once a year
Everyone looks good in a sweater
ur mum looks good in a sweater
She does, actually
she is part of everyone
Tony tell her you don't need sweaters in the desert
what about knitted blouses that technically are not sweaters?
Could they be easily mistaken for sweaters?
You call them sweaters but no one here does.
And I think you're biased against them
So they are sweaters
knits are everywhere
Im bringing my sweaters
its decided
You'll look out of place
its vegas
Sweaters don't belong here
sweaters should be left on the plane when you arrive in vegas
nobody will take them
and then when you leave there's a complimentary sweater finder service
My sweaters would feel abandoned, and I couldn't forgive myself
man what the hell
people in the angies list chat are literally bartering 2 roosters right now
like 2 actual real roosters
o.o
tell them you'll trade them some seal blubber for both of them
alaskan gold
(saw it on a show)
lol
I've gotta say the weirdest thing about my new job is the fact that I'm already on the interview panel for prospective employees lol
that was fast
You're telling me
I filled in for someone else yesterday and the manager said that I do very well as part of the panel so I'm basically in for every one in my department
What kind of stuff do they havve you doing? Other than interview stuff
Learnig
A lot
lol
Currently watching boring-ass training videos
man this anglieslist project is terrible
i can have a totally working module one day, then the next day it wont run at all
and I haven't touched the code
I spend 80% of my time just making stuff that stopped working work again
Ouch
So far I've gained a decent handle on xml, json, wsdl, wadl,  linux, and xquery
and now I'm learning their actual producy
Product*
Typing on a phone is hard apparently
lol yes
wut
Brandon do you have cox at home?
yes
Have you been having crappy service the last say.... 5 days?
no
darn
I hope our line isn't corroded or something
lol
either that or its time for the yearly call to complain
they will tell you to unplug your router and modem
and plug it back in
lol
and it then your internet will be fine for 5 minutes
and then you hang up
and it will suck again
then you call again
and they tell you to do it again
and you say you already did
and they will be like "well, there's nothing in the script that tells me what to do if you already did that"
"but we can send a tech some time tomorrow between 9am and 5pm"
and then the tech people call and say they'll be there in a week
and show up and are clueless
I mean its been seriously potato for the past few days
well, it looks like your connection is working, but it's slow, so i'll have a call to tech support and see what they can do. Okay, they said they can have a technician out tomorrow between 9 and 5
inf loop
see?
potato
your upspeed seems normal
does it sometimes work well but then drop down in speed for periods of time?
We're supposed to get 30 down and 12 up
nope
its just potato all day
lately
could be a bad splitter
I had that issue once
I had to suggest the possibility to the tech
he was about to leave and I told him to check it
he replaced it and my speed was fine afterward
dang
why is yours not potato
lol
mine is a blazing fast tomato
red for speed
mine is a banana
pretty normal, slightly fruity, nothing too crazy
plagued by disease?
nah it's a GMO
boycotted by hippies?
yep
they hate it
can't handle my download
Dis storm doe
is it bad?
i'm working from home
so i havent been outside
lol
Down here on the south end of town its been crazy
well i guess today was a good day to work from home then
ugh
scala
its stupid
There were two news crews at the flood basin out here
And like half an inch of water
lol
this chunk of code would take me less than a minute to write in any other language
but this is taking hours
u luv scala
he luv skala
how do you know cox script so well
I applied for a long term position, they told me I knew too much and was overqualified
huh
awe
also nao rob mallery just added me on linkedin
so thank you
np
he said they aren't looking for designers in Vegas yet. They're building up design in SF and NY first
but once we're more established with design stuff, we'll begin expanding it to other offices
gotcha
same as last time but hey
he knows my name
he knows my face
and i know where he lives
i mean
he told me to remind him about you when we hire a sr designer in vegas
networking
o.o SENIOR?!
you would be working under the senior designer
lol
whew ok
damn
not BE the senior
i wals ike WAIT NO
yeah man
i told him you were an expert
tons of experience. YEARS!
total senior position material
min 100k/yr
...hm
that's it?
lol
Sometimes Tony, you gotta rocket yourself out there
yep, that's why you need rocket league
ride the moose over the river.
or a rocket powered car
or a rocket powered moose
^
yes
^^
still though that is awesome
thank you brandon
np
dem references
I am allergic to moose
why are you allergic to moose?
he is afraid it might be his spirit animal, don't you know.
I know my spirit animal

no it isnt
it costs time
nahhh
might get rocket league
do it
not sure if physically possible or not
it almost looks plausible
Thats like $400 of railway cars
i wouldn't know
but i woudl know you like trains
trains
trains are like mechanical snakes
snakes are typically used to represent evil
thus it is fitting
because ian is evil
Trains aren't snakes
are snakes trains
yes
so
you gonna get RL?
maybe
well you know what they say
there's no time like the present
audacity or no
?
wat
the sound thing
shoudl be fine
it'll be fine
wat
making ong
song
Depends on what you're making
mp3 cli
....
a song?
recording tracks
to mix in software
separate tracks
got an example?
what exactly are you asking
want to mix these two
you want to mix two songs?
he wants to record audio tracks
and combine them
yes
like
unsure how hard to explain
i.e. vocals and guitar
etc
audacity will work fine for that
why does piano clip not show up...
in audacity?
yeah
that mp3 I import
is like
.08 seconds
hmm indeed it is
that's weird
probably malformed file
hm
phoen only records in ag3
the mp3 is probably fixable
.0080 seconds
ugh
yeesh
i converted it to an mp4
it made loud noises
yeah
must rerecord
nah
give me 2 minutes
well the timing is off anyways
aww yiss
how
black magic
nah
i jsut played it in VLC while recording with audacity
lol
lol oy
well
it's off speed anyways
vlc huh
andrew needs to get back
im feeling the need to RL
sec
he said he would be back at 9. it is 9
where is he!
OUTRAGEOUS!
i dont' need the dlc do i
nao
no
k
the dlc is just cosmetic stuff
oh but bed time
are you working tomorrow?
yes
i'm full time now
oh
:/
i keep getting sucked deepr and deeper
12 peopel quit this week
lol
i just became like
so much more valuable
they still haven't trained me on a lot of shi
get everyone else to quit and become the big boss
then outsorce all your responsibility
trying
fuck me am I trying
new employee
should've taken over some ofmy responsibilities
"oh but my work is just so hard"
so im doing it
so no rl for you tonight then?
probably not
well
tomorrow is casual friday
and evilly enough
if i fuck up
what are they gonna do
fire me?
(they might)
(but still they know I'm up to my neck in work)
(they luv me)
i have RL
well
im up for it if you are
my laptop is apparently going to be double screwed based on recent reddit posts. It will have win 10 spyware AND lenovo spyware!
...oy
ok one sec
may have you do magic conversion again
send it
god
dangit
every time i record it someone messages me and causes background noise to mess it up
thal messaged me on skype like 10 seconds before it was done
mute your skype
skype isnt an issue if i am tabbed to it
i wasn't anticipating steam
oh
i meant to say steam
not skype
lol
andrew is 30 minutes late
unacceptable
if I suck on my microphone it causes my audio playback to stutter
interesting
...interesting
it isnt just a hardware thing either, it actually stutters on audacity too
also blowing on the mic doesnt cause it
I remember Andrew
like it was an hour ago
may he rest in pieces
SO SAY WE ALL
Gaben
Adama
wat
Bill
bill what
adama
whodat
so say we all
I don't understand
bill adama
william "bill" adama
Who is that
Commander of the Battlestar Galactica
oh
I haven't seen that show
I haven't seen all of it
I've seen like the first half and last eighth
I see
Sort of
i need mah rocket league
nah
war thunder
i am going to assume there is no RL happening tonight
War Thunder?
nop
scala
war thunderrrr

controller setup is strange
ok lets do it
Brandon Worl

Ian
imma upgrade my laptorp to windoze 10 meow
ok but know they changed the EULA to sniff out pirated software
got a link to that?
they also have a few security issues at the moment
I'd wait until service pack 1
its my laptorp
idk if it has issues
i never use it
lol
gonna do a fresh install too
also the upgrade wont be free forever
well they did something like require your login info for your router or something stupid
leverington was talking about it
there's an anti win 10 circle jerk going on in full force right now
I guarantee it is blown out of proportion
probably
lol
RL guyz?
im gonna get food in a minute
but i just got home :(
going to dnd
i can do a round or two while i wait on people
gotta go
tah
bai
hi
hi
hiel
hai
greetings
windoges 10 takes forever to download
i bet
RLRLRL?
yes
woo
Brandon Worl
no
Brandon Worl
sup folks
hi
so I just looked at a photosphere of my old room in reno with my Google Cardboard
it was so strange
so familiar
yet
not?
no it was familiar
I had sushi for dinner
was it slimy?
Not at all
The place I went to was good though
if you let fish sit it developes that mucus film
also don't order eel
well i let my laptop sit to download windows 10 for like 5-6 hours
then i clicked the view progress button
and it was at 0%
looooooool
once i opened the progress window it started though
Its watching you already
so much for "dont worry it will download in the bg and let you know when its done"
lol oh?
now it is late and the install process has started
14%
looks like it'll be a late night
want to play a game then?
wat gam
no idea
you?
no idea
you?
same
ricardos
when
Any day
thor's day?
monday-weds
why no thor's day
I could do thorday
but I'd have to pack early
for friday
We still need to hammer out the plan
i think thor's day works best for tony
for friday
we need to actually plan the trip
for reals
and figure out how I am getting to you guys
indeed
And we need a tony
to discuss
I wonder how viable it is to create several website/apps to generate passive income
probably fairly viable if you find the market for them
there was a reddit thread on /r/webdev
one guy was making 1k/month selling wordpress themes
it's saturday, the kids go out and play, I was up in mah room, I let the Rocket League BLAZE
wow
that's not bad
yeah
also i have windows 10 on my laptop now
was a pain in the ass
lol
good stuff though?
After upgrading I told it to do a fresh reinstall
but it never asked me which drive
I was going to install it on the SSD
so I formatted the SSD to remove ubuntu
which broke my bootloader
so I fixed that
lol
but then windows boot manager was broken
so I had to fix that too
so you didnt get to bed for quite some time
then I decided to just keep it on the HDD and save the SSD to expand my desktop storage
I went to bed at 1
and just finished this morning
oh gotcha
my laptop is running a lot better now
mostly because it is a fresh install but also a bit because of windows 10
nice
sada from frankie's videos
he's really bad
lol
damn
goalie training is hard
goalie training?
RL has training
it just made me rage quit
oh wow
it's really, really hard
lol
wanna play some
?
sure

holy crap
this guy on Stargate Universe was the voice of Ralf, from Ed Edd and Eddy
wat
he also voiced the canadian version of Goku in DBZ
so sad
no more stargate universe
there's a canadian version of goku?
i guess so
he probably says "KAM eh KAM eh HA"
lol
it's "KAM eh HAM eh HA"
but close enough
yes
indeed
so for sure ricardos thurdog?
yes
bueno
que hora?
after work some time
so like 6+?
yeah
okay
sounds good
Rust looks like a cool programming language
it's like C++ except you don't have to worry about memory management
whelp, updating my laptop to win10
that sounds nice
so auto-deletion/garbage collection
I'm not sure how it works
it might not be garbage collection
could also be compile time checking for memory leak situations
i just know you can't segfault with it
that sounds nice
lol
yeah
same performance as c/c++ too
cool
what would you use it for though?
anything you would use c/c++ for
it is also good at web stuff
Mozilla made Rust for their... thing
i forget what
lol
it's basically a safer and more modern c++
anything that needs good performance could use it
with that tag it does sound appealing
I haven't tried it, but a few people at Originate really like it
I feel like a dude in my group for that game design class with eelke was talking about it like it was the next big thing
it's possible
one of the guys in your group is friends with the guy in my office who has a Rustgasm every time he talks about it
so I wouldnt doubt it
lol
wanna play a quick RL game or two?
yes
I only have a few minutes for now, but after 4 i'll be more free
you are already free
cuz this is 'merica
Brandon Worl
Brandon Worl
you try cortana out?
nope
seems kinda weird having a search ai on my computer
normally that's something you wouldnt need
it also is terrible at searching
apparently
lol
it's just MS feeling the need to match Google Now and Siri
yeah
you mean google chick and siri
yeah her name is Now
it's belgian
no
she's google chick
that's her name
GET IT RIGHT
no

Wish me luck folks, I am looking into arma mods
Arma + Mods = wow
waow
waaow
yes

I may have found a new way for us to play

still testing
but there are missions for small groups
and some servers that use these mods
Hi

>_>
ok so no use worrying about it now
i'll find out asap tomorrow
okayyyyyyy
10/10 mess
my phone calendar threw me off
i'm sure i didn't fuck up
99.9% sure
that's right couldn't do monday
because school for Ian
ok
tony you're worrying us
Yes
Also
i know i didn't mean to my bad
How I am getting in to you guys' car?
walk to tony's house
we will probably pick you up
you might want to start walking the day before
Okay
just have your stuff packed and loaded
er
ready to load
haha
That works
better yet
have your shit loaded Thursday
how
I'll just teleport it
teleportation isn't invented yet ian
Oh right
did you enter the wrong year in your time machine?
I meant 
the nice thing about time machines is that once they are invented they have always been invented
So you guys will pick me up and we'll head out from here?
most likely
yaaaaas
Do you want  me to drive some of the trip?
since I know the route?
Or just direct you
Its ~5 hours total
4 to ely then 1 more after that
i just need someone awake to navigate
I don't sleep on that road
since it makes me nervous as hell
roads put me to sleep like a switch
Did Tony poof again?
foop
here sorry
but again I just need someone to navigate and talk to
Have you done a lot of driving on 2 lane highways with semi-trucks?
guh
yes
okay
just checking
are we gonna need to pass 'em
lots
feck
well
morning is easy enough
not twilight
its bad all the time
lol
teh load is gonna be very different though with 3 peeps + stuff
it's like that most of the way to reno
oh also
GAS MONEY
and CLEAN UP YOUR FAST FOOD STUFF
CASH MONEY
that is all i request
That's why I asked, I have like 600 hours of 2 lane road driving
and yes
I will help with gas
si
And I know places for us to eat so we don't have to have fast food
yo tambien
Tony is a master of the disappearing act.
100% pro
100/100
i can't tell if you people are still talking to me
sounds good
hello tony
how are you
speaking of disappearing
Tony did you read the part about my 600 hours of 2 lane road time?
i just remembered someone messaged me on the originate chat
and i never answered them
lol oh shit
no i didn't
Yeah
didn't see how it applied to my 2 lane road time
are you asking to drive
you can drive if you prefer
I am saying I could if need be
plz don't total my car
oh yeah no worries
i appreciate it
That would be the bottom of the list
may take you up on that
A wreck on a 2 lane road = dead
not just totaled
dead
70mph + 35 tons = too much force
(ded)
100% ded
yes ded
andrew sent me a text and now my phone wont turn on
GG
gg phone
well played
buce
er
nice
buce
hmmm what to do
i started browsing mass drop last night
i came dangerously close to spending all of my money
mass drop
what is that
stuff
discounted
oh shit
no
yes
DISCOUNTS?!?!?!?!?!?
they have deals, then the more people who buy the deal, the cheaper the price becomes
so it might start at 30% off, but if 15 people buy it it drops to 20% off and if 50 people buy it it goes to 50% off
ugh
i need to sign up
erm
Is it worth signing up for?
assuming my percentages made sense
just sign up with FB
or
better yet
let me invite you!
mkay
you get discounts don't you
if i invite 5 people i get a personalized gift box
worth around $50
but only if all 5 buy stuff
so i dont expect that
lol
lol
it constantly gets new deals though and you can vote on upcoming deals
good place for gift ideas maybe
nice
thank you
np
it has a lot of mechanical keyboard stuff if you're in to that sort of thing
I see that writing category
That rOtring 600 is tempting
it's a really nice pencil
I knew someone freshman year who had one
This stuff
so expensive
The Seiko watch for 114 is good
Full lock picks set for $90
it is expensive
but it is cheaper than normal
yes
hm
hmm?
hmmm!
who downloaded what
that makes no sense
what
i heard a download sound
wut
I should start quilting
everybody likes blankets
no
liar
i prefer knitted blankets
I like trains
they breathe better when i wrap myself up
but...those let the cold in
combine it with a sheet
and I already know how to sew and don't want to learn how to knit until im 63 and a half
Trains produce heat
learn how to make foam costume armor with me
who needs a blanket when you have foam armor
true
Trains are made of metal
do you have a heat gun
foam is lighter
which is a natural armour
better mpg
i do
ahah
You have a heat gun?
Like an industrial heat gun?
i have been watching lots of instruction videos too
idk
it is a gun
that shoots heat
it is my dads
Like a super blowdryer
it is for use in the garage not the bathroom
exactly
it gets hot
i have bought the basic materials for foam armor
Can I borrow it in a month or so for a few days for a saxophone repair?
foam, knife sharpener, contact cement
that should be fine
I have to replace instrument pads and its a pain to do with flame
i still have to buy a good knife and respirator
a heat gun makes life easy
i bought some plaster bandages
to make a body cast
so i can fit stuff to myself without awkwardly trying to hold stuff to myself while working
What are you going to make?
mass effect armor most likely
I see
unless i change my mind before the rest of my stuff gets delivered
hm
so much neat stuff to be bought
guh
yeah
Sup folks
hi
I got my 8x56mmR ammo today
It had to come from Serbia
ohai
so brandon
when you say "early"
my early or your early
rocket league?
wut
no rocket league?
Brandon is dead
please ring back later
oh ok
ian what time did you want to leave
Ideal?
Be on the road between 8:00 and 9:00
not like leaving
but be on the road
yeah
so my early
ok
when nao rings
6am?
unless you like semis
Yeah
k
Do you like Semi trucks?
it'll take a lot of convincing of nao
We'll scare him with semi trucks
Seriously its a major route
Cause its a straight line with low grades between Canada and here
6am is fine
lol
ok
meaning
packed and ont he road fromyour place at 7
or we can just pack your stuf Thurs night
lets do thurs night s
k
i didnt even realize i hit enter
i was just sitting here wondering how my message disappeared
but yeah, that way i make less noise because i think my mom is still asleep at 6
and moving fire wood in the morning sounds less pleasant
ian, did you find any smaller fishing poles or do you only have one-piece poles?
oh firewood right
so
we doing anything thursday after ricardos?
with andrewwww
dunno watcha wanna do
i wonder how late i'm able to get in the originate office
cuz we could do Smash
I only have long poles :(
idk if they will fit in tony's car
I doubt it
lol
i was driving behind one of his car earlier today
how long are they?
At shortest?
like 6 feet
let me double check
Shortest is 5
and not collapsable
all our poles are serious business poles
lol
we could by cheap collapsable ones in Ely
we could just hold on to them outside the car with the windows down
and joust with them
10/10 would lose eye/arm/hand again
ideas or opinions?
we can try to fit them
They won't
lol
we could also not fish or try to fashion a trap
my sister has Nissan too
if it was in the front passenger seat and pointed back they might fit
Might
tony we have to fish
i have to catch a fish
Though my sister's is not a hatchback
i didnt even know you had a sister
I do
didn't know either..
who is this stranger person we're going to the wilderness with?!
meeee
Also a cheap creek rod is like $20
we really only need 1 rod right?
well if only you plan to catch one
then we only need 1 license too
well i have no clue how to catch a fish
So long as you real it in its fine
but if we want to save money we could just share a rod
patience and timing
i've gotten nibbles
but never managed to hook
So long as we do that its fine
So long as you real in the fish
will there be people there watching us?
Possibly? but with creek fishing you are mostly by yourself
well then nobody will know who reels it in
True
but you want to real it in
i do want to reel one in
honestly, the rangers go buy number of rods and number of licenses
tony you want to RL?
already rling
Yeah tony want to Real life
yis
mumble
irl
hello friends
we are on rocket league
coem save us
we need real skill
yeah rangers go by numRods/numLicenses, and if that isn't equal to 1 then things go badong
I can
but I can't chat
we can skype if you cant mumble
can't do either, I'd ear rape you with horribad mic and headphones
ok
bane is hosting the party
okey
you need to match our theme
the lag is real
this internet is shit
it is insanely frustrating to save/score the ball only to have yourself repositioned a foot away from the correct spot
their netcode needs some work if decent internet can't keep up
everyone had 80ish ping
i was even having some sync issues
yeah that's bad news bears
tahhhh~
ok there
tahhhh~
mehhhh~
hehhhh~
meowww~
wowwww~
BADONG
GGG~
I wonder if it was because steam was downloading
that'll do it
well it just finished
although steam pauses dls while you play
orly
well then that wouldn't be it
by default yeah
probably was an east coast server
ill try a 1v1 real quick and see if its better
ever1 else stopped playing
well either way it'll tell me if this is gonna be a regular thing or not
yeah it definitely still happened a  few times that game
I barely won against a far inferior player
AND HIS NAME IS JOHNNNNN CENAAAAAAAAA
lol did you see that RL post on reddit?
lol
er
yes
nope
yes i did
john cena and two other pro wrestler dudes were all in a squad against this guy who posted
oh shit
link
just their names
but yeah
and in the comments was the john cena prank call video
yerp
and I watched it all again
lol
so good
yes
so so good
the best
that url sounds like it is meant for hipsterhippos
#justbrandonthings
but that isnt me in the gif!
it could be >.>
lol
jkjk
no way man
you're not that bad
i was doing well earlier
lol
before you joined us
lol
I believe it
I'm just sad that I wont be able to play til I get back home
can't play if lag's gonna ruin my night
I get ragey in the first place if I mess up
ye ye boiiiii
brb
kkk
hi
hi
i am on my laptop now
i need to get originate to give me a new laptop
lol
this one can't keep up with all the crap you gotta run for AL
my cpy load is always between 3.8 and 5.5ish
ouch
yeah
i have to limit the amount of chrome tabs I use
and i cant use intellij
now that's a first world problem
if i right click in intellij, the system freezes for like 10 seconds
lol
like right clicking in the ecc
lol
god help you if you click the left handed mouse icon
you'll be there waiting for days
lol seriously though
and everyone has tried it at least once
yup
i tried it twice
for science
oh noez
to see if it is that bad every time
there goes an hour of your time
I forget what we were doing during that game engine class with sushil, but a bunch of us ended up with frozen pc's so we ended up just moving to new computers
I think we were testing his openECSLNT
man this error makes no sense
angieslist makes no sense
rly though
it doesnt
how do they even
they dont even
you know what grinds my gears
when project managers start trying to make software design decisions
without knowing the consequences of those decisions
lol that sounds like the definition of a bad idea
welcome to AL
yehhhhh
lol
poor you
you and your job
:F
rly though it does sound like a pain in the ass lol
yaaas
jerrrb
project management should be a mandatory class that actually makes people learn in like elementary school, it should just be implanted in people's brains
whelp, heading to bed
lemme know via text how Thursday works out
ok
good night
greetings
I'm starting to know how nao feels regarding compilers... Running a website tracer that goes down two clicks and it's taken 15 minutes so far, and I still have 3 more to run :/
guys
i won a $25 gas gift card for national startup day
nice
how?
raffle
aha
nearly everyone left by the end of the dat
day*
lol
i just worked from up stairs so i was there till the end
and they drew like 15 tickets before they got to me
everyone else had left :D
haha nice
Lol
Nao, do you know what software your qa dept uses?
umm not sure
the project I'm on has AL doing QA
I assume they probably use like... a monkey or something
if it gives a thumbs up it passes
if it throws shit then you know somethings wrong
although it has been like 2 months and none of my code has been QA'd
so maybe they just dont
Doesn't sound like the stuff my company makes
Also, lol
what does your company make?
Several tools, one is called soatest which basically acts as a user for web based apps/services
Another one called virtualize, not totally sure what it does yet, since I'm still taking the training test for soatest
I can bs my way through what it does, but it wouldn't be an accurate description
is it like automated integration testing stuff?
Yes
ah. We used something for that on the project I was an intern on
I forget what
Selenium coupled with something else
Selenium is what is slowing down some of my work currently >.>
lol
yeah, it was nice at the startup day thing. We watched Jobs and The Social Network
so I just watched those while stuff compiled
My favorite tool in soatest though is one that will record everything you do in a browser and do exactly that again, and you can add checks to values and stuff with it
sounds useful
And then load up load testing software and ddos it xD
our tests worked something like -> load the page -> expect some element to be on page -> except some result when interacting with a specific element
Yyyyeah... Ours says load the page, check if the element is on the page, and if it isn't, it will tell you at what point it deviates from expectation
Super useful
yeah, that's more or less what ours did
I didnt use it much though
so i dont know the specifics
Fair enough
all my work was back end
Freaking static analysis is so slow
so I spent more time around unit tests
Our stuff can generate unit tests :)
...oops
My site web started to branch out across internet space :x
that sounds like a big web
the internet is a big place
if you were to simulate an entire planet, down to the atom, would it take a planet sized computer?
it would take multiple bits of ram at least per atom
and i assume a bit is larger than a single atom
with some of the new processors they're coming out with maybe not
i mean just memory alone
oh then probably
that's true
cause each memory cell is several atoms
seems weird
like there should be a way around that
come up with it and become rich
lol
any news on the happie haps tomorrow?
Yo yo
We goin' to Rickie's at some point
yeye
I think we were gonna hang someplace afterwards as well
Didn't hear about that
well
we should
lol
where EXACTLY is the camping thing?
like
"we're going camping at...."
Lehman Caves?
gentlemen
sweet justice hath been dispensed this day
on my way home I decided to switch freeways, and the one I switched to happened to have a massive wreck on it
some jerk decided to use the emergency lane to go faster, but was unable to get back over to the usual lanes
I decided to not let him over, and there was another car in front of him that overheated
then I heard that amazing "woop woop" sound
lol
i didnt see anyone to ask about whether or not you could stop by the office andrew
since it was startup day
and the person i had to ask worked from home the second half of the day
you could just stop by at like 4:30
i'm sure it would be fine
speaking of which
what time for ricardos?
I am planning on just going there from Originate
Tony
Wheeler peak
in Great Basin National forest
also
I think we need to seriously consider how we plan to fit tents, sleeping bags, coats, blankets, duffle bags of clothes, fishing gear, a cooler large enough for food for 3 people, and 3 people in Tony's car
and fire wood
And firewood
Plus, hopefully an axe and a gun
we could do a 3 person tent to save space
oh and my folding camping shovel
my tent is itty bitty
I'm mostly worried about the cooler + wood
well
we plan on filling the cooler at ely right?
Yes
So we can stuff things in the cooler
so we can put stuff in the cooler on the drive there
yeah
That doesn't make it more plausible
Cause we'll still need to fill it
well the last hour being uncomfortable is better than the whole thing being uncomfortable
having a tent or sleeping bag on your lap for an hour isnt that bad
True
I'm just afraid it won't all fit
lol
plus we need cooking stuff
and water
lots of water
hmm
it'll be tight
That's my point
I can pack light, as far as clothes and such goes
Plus I don't want his back window covered with stuff while driving
yeah
You need clothes for cold weather
And at least 1 blanket in addition to you sleeping bag
we can sit on blankets
jeans should be fine yes? for during the day
Yes
oh wheeler peak is forcasted to be warm this weekend
low 80s
I have thermal shirts that should keep me warm combined with a sweater or jacket
with upper 40s at night
google says mid 50s for the low
Even better
If google is right
Tomorrow want to meet me at Bass Pro before Ricardos?
We can decide on fishing stuff there and pick up anything we might need
supply wise
I could
It would be easier if you did
lol
well, when are we planning to do ricardos?
Want to do 6:30 or 7:00?
Well
What time can you leave work tomorrow?
I can technically leave any time after 3ish
but typically I stay till 5:30
We could meet at bass pro at 4:00?
if you are up to leaving early
then have ricardos at 5:30
if that works for Tony
we're doing the farewell party for our interns, their last day is friday
so i dont know if we'll be doing stuff or what
ah
farewell is from 3:30 to 4:30
Meet at 5:00 then?
lol
At bass
then dinner at 6:30?
assuming that works for tony, it works for me
Okay
We need tony
also I am still concered about space
if you say his name 33 times backwards, he will appear
ynot
Tony Tony Tony Tony Tony Tony Tony Tony Tony Tony Tony Tony Tony Tony Tony Tony Tony Tony Tony Tony Tony Tony Tony Tony Tony Tony Tony Tony Tony Tony Tony Tony Tony
Backwards?
lol
ynot ynot ynot ynot ynot ynot ynot ynot ynot ynot ynot ynot ynot ynot ynot ynot ynot ynot ynot ynot ynot ynot ynot ynot ynot ynot ynot ynot ynot ynot ynot
That works
There are 3 lakes up there
Toe Knee
tonysan
So
Really
How are we going to make it all fit?
sheer power of will
well
lol
Also my father told me the best places to fish up there
so we should be able to get something
Do you want to eat the trout or just catch and release?
well
im not a big fan of fish
So catch and release
yee
yee
can you text tony for a planning meeting tonight?
yee
I love fresh trout :(
i texted him
he said not soon
Did he say later tonight?
cause we gots to plans man
i asked if he can some time tonight and he said yeah
okay
good good
yeah
so what do we need from bass pro?
A short creek rod
bait
and some hooks
plus I want to look at their camping supplies
also probably a small propane tank
gg
So 5:00 tomorrow @ Bass
next to the silverton
well
built into it
isnt that the only bass?
yes
I wan't sure if you had been there before
that human is giant to be able to grab a shark like that
lol
my Chrome suddenly has more spyware and virus ads than a 83 year old's internet explorer
i have no clue how
What you do?
dunno
it was supposedly installed last night
Did you win the free Ipad?
no but someone called me about 2 weeks ago and told me I won a free cruise to the Caribbean
lol
how useful
For when you need that really accurate knife
aiming a knife is hard
this stuff wont go away
there are ads all over my Chrome
any new programs or plugins?
i uninstalled the program that showed up in the uninstall programs list
and removed all of my chrome extensions
and ran malware bytes
and its still there
yes
Spooky
whats your anti-virus
i dont use any
uninstall and download google ultron?
Win7?
yeah
download and run that
then delete it
lol
or not
it might just be time to do a fresh install
I have a new SSD and HDD to install anyways
fair enough
there are apparently audio ads playing, but my speakers are off
also these ads are lagging Chrome so much to where I am having difficulty downloading stuff
the longer a page is open the more ads there are
......
this thing replaces all hyperlinks on text "download" with links to ads
dang it even gets incognito windows
damn
it even affects steam
It goes deep
which is essentially a web app in a desktop wrapper
can you find me a direct download url for combofix? lol
yes
one sec
download.bleepingcomputer.com/dl/e3a2bf7605d7412e429b1403befddb4e/55d55160/windows/security/anti-virus/c/combofix/ComboFix.exe
wow messy
lol
ah yay, it is downloading
it was preventing me from downloading anything
that's amazing
I assume it wouldnt affect internet in my VMs
Find out?
lol
no, combofix took over before I could test it
Whats it finding?
wininit.ini
So I should download that?
sonova
its still there
this thing is tough
I believe I got it when I installed a somewhat shady looking usb boot drive creator
I had to use it to make a recovery drive for my laptop
this was like a week ago though
so it must have waited to start messing with stuff
VM is fine
It was a time bomb
brb restarting
so persistent
Still there
yes
running MS security essentials now
im suprised combofix didnt get it
brb
okay
this scan is slow
It goes thru all your files
all of them
this scan is stuck
I wonder if it found something
time elpased just says 00:00:57
or its digging thru it
1684 items scanned, 57 seconds
You ran a full scan?
quick scan
Do a full one
it started on its own as a quick scan
the quick only does your temp folders
and windows root folder
it isnt responding
it wont reopen after i forced it to close
restarted and launched a full scan... hopefully it actually finishes
hopefully
even if it fixes it i'll probably still do a fresh install
well im gonna let this run
if tony shows up to plan things, one of you should text me and I will return
okay
I took a tier 1 in war thunder to tier V
so
windows security thing found no threats
WOW
wow
you know what else it didnt find
ur mum
close
tony
tony
i think i finally fixed chrome
how about your steam?
good question
steam looks fine
pretty sure IE and FF will still have it though
ie seems to be clean actually
same for FF
guess I got it
I had to scan with malware bytes twice, microsoft security thing, combofix, and some other scanner
that last scanner deleted my FTB launcher
lol
wow
game is clearly virus
I'll still do a fresh install though
I should probably change my passwords too
of chrome?
Yeah
of windows
Probably
oh
that works
at least the immediate issues are fixed
now imma go to bed
i will meet you at bass pro shop at 5 tomorrow
5 it is
Monty Python sketch I was talking about at dinner:
Brandon mister boring was dascalu wasn't it
hello remaining doc
dis chat so empty without briantony
indeed it is
I tried a lightning tendrils/trap build with insane crit on tempest
how'd it work?
made it to act IV and rip'd so hard in one of those corrupted monsters areas
lol
like seriously
ran in
started dropping traps
frogs leaped
I ded
eww
steam is down
o.O that doesn't happen too often
yeah really
all clients are down
well, their client connection server is anyway
people who already logged in are good
OH
have you been watching punchy hobo?
yes
I havent had this much fun watching streams in a while
fucking hilariously awesome
hasn't dropped a unique yet
lol
I know, it's insane
I have like 6 on warbands with two level 20 characters
I thought for sure he'd get one when he had the lightning nova shrine two nights ago
he actually full cleared a zone
rngeesus hates hobos apparently
oh lame he didnt do any hobo last night
yup I already checked :(
that physics game looked interesting though
cool tech demo kinda thing
currently im just enjoying agrarian skies 2 though
finally got around to making an automatic ore setup
runs entirely off of solar, but im going to need more panels very soon
and they take about a bajillion silver
lol
AG skies 2 looked nice
Idk if I can get back into mc right before school starts back up though
seems like a bad idea
You're all back :D
how was it?
I LIVE
hai
how was it?
Beautiful

the only way I play is by turning it up to 11
(eleven)

that's a hq pic actually
My grandpa called the restraunt
also
my grandma made us cookies :(
D:
GG
i called it
I said that was going to happen
Tony I hear I need to kill you
why
Under Oath
Did you
or did you not
release photos
of me
did not?
You didn't
Was it brandon?
courtney must have hacked them
I strongly disapprove of this
Strongly
i haven't uploaded any photos
if i do should i not tag you?
Please do not tag me
I don't have facebook
also please don't upload singles of me if you can help it
To anywhere on the internet
Including other people's email inboxes
makes you uncomfortable does it
strongly disapprove?
hmmm
why
I hate all images of myself
I believe I went over that when I asked for no photos of me to be taken
lol your hatred of your photos are like my hatred of swazis
Swazis are easily purged, photos seem to be more resilient and require much stronger measure to destroy.
i'll only post a photo of you for each swazi you draw
I'd prefer if you just delete them
I can virtually guarantee I feel more strongly about photos of me than you do about swastikas
lol i won't post any
but i have a few on had
like lots actually
just for every future swazi I see you careve
(why can't i send one to courtney)
I'll give you $10 to delete them all
nah
$20
n
o
And a hamburger
y u hate pics
with onion rings
and bbq sauce
for real
no ham
but y u h8 px tho
My hate for photos of me is life long
and complex
no one likes photos of themseles
well sometimes
$30?
With the Hamburger that total comes close to $30
lol
i'm not deleting them regardless lol
Don't you like sandwiches Tony?
love sammiches
Sandwiches > Pictures of Ian
but i dunno why you hate u pics
Right?
like i dunno
your hatred of photos of you is like my hatred of the swazis
y u h8 ur px
You only have a passing hatred of Nazi paraphanalia
I feel bad taht your gma made cookies :<
I do too
she made them with love
She always does
and we denied her D:
we crushed her
And took pictures I am deeply unhappy with
nah man you look good in the pics
you look fine
i won't upload any solos but i will upload ones including you
I don't look good
lol
what is the point of dressing snappily and all those hats if not to look fly as fuck in photos brah
I like to dress that way
but hate photos
you enjoy them
you just want someone to be like "eff that dude"
"take the photoes"
Burn the photos?
nope
You know, in a lot of ways I hate digital cameras
here: encouragement encouragement encouragement
s'all good
pix going up
maybe they aint
meybe they is
I'm sure Courtney won't do anything with your pic. She already knows what you look like anyways
greetings doctores
first day was a mild failcess
first class is now an independent study: success
late to second class because hearthstone distracted me (new expansion today): fail
SOMA is on sale now
three bucks off 30 dollars
comes out sept 22
dunno what soma is
also
Ian
i'm zipping all solo pics of you for you to distribute at your discretion
Ah thanks
np
SOMA is basically the new Amnesia
except new theme
...hm
lol you chose the hat sir
yes I did
you're renowned for your choice headgear
yup
the stupider the better
lol
lol i googled soma
um

yee
yeyeye
and anddrew's on league
er
rocket league
i was indeed
playing with nova and lsin and tocksman
nice
now i am going for froyo
whee
my brother just drove up in a giant armadillo
wat
yup
...huh
it has a whopping 6 inches of clearance when going under overpasses
whew
the hell
so odd
it's pretty normal for him
he didnt even mention it
we just happen to see it
lol
sounds right
my car got delayed again
now the ETA is just some time this week
again?
I have good news everybody!
I have a set date for when I will forever be done with AngiesList! :D
Tomorrow!?!?!
nice
I will at most be on AL for 37 more days
oh nao what were those UI Prototyping programs?
our contract is apparently blowing up and falling to itty bitty pieces with no hope of renewal
Axure, InVision, and Pixate
oh wow...yay?
and thank you
yes yay
the office erupted in applause when that was announced
XD awesome
oh my god pixate is beautiful
yeah i am looking at it right now
seems cool
if you want to do some collab project with design/dev let me know
yes i do
like i'm excited lol
would be a cool way for us to both learn new things
i'm so down
oh also www.supercomfysocks.com is becoming a real thing
that is hilarious
like the site is almost ready to launch and fulfill orders
o.o
i like how
originate jsut makes shit
like
"im gonna do this"
"i did this"
the guy who bought it apparently spent the entire weekend working on it
lol nice
like he didnt sleep
passion project
he maintained the balmer peak for 36 straight hours
his liver is probably going to explode
but at least his socks will be comfy
XD god
it all started because someone pointed out that Alex M had a hole in his sock
and he said he knew but they were comfy so he keeps wearing them, and he can't find new ones
lol
wow
then someone said "supercomfysocks.com"
and then someone replied "it is available!"
the rest is history
lol
and now the Director of Business Operations is employee #1 at supercomfysocks
packing boxes of socks
lol
XD
nice
...must figure out problem
y=mx+b
slope
roit
must be simple
I am trying that Exile mod again
want to join me brandon
me
sure
Ian
Brandon Worl
night all
Ian
Brandon Worl
is invisible a me
engrish
it is a turtle
I can't find the software enginnering book for free :(
but he didnt make it visible to non-friends
ah
what is the title?
is it even required?
software engineering by ian sommerville, 10th edition
I have the 9th
and supposedly yes
but idk if we need it for homework or what
unless things have changed i dont think you need it
well that is good news
I have the 9th edition so maybe if we do I can get by with that
it's dascalu again right?
yeh
the dude is always out of breath
hmmm actually we did have some book homework
like seriously
lol yes
i dont think i bought the book
idk
maybe i did
i'll find out when I get home
coo coo
I have embedded games next
then AI
but they're so spread out
well, you could plan to be productive during the gaps, keep it up for a week, then regress in to just wasting time and/or playing games
because that's how real life works
or I could start with that
lol
yeah no point in beating round the bush
exactly
this new hearthstone expansion is eating away at my time
it's just so interesting
new everything
my cpu load is 8.8
4 is 100%
>_<
o.o
how do you even compute
slowly
there is officially a hamster running a wheel inside your computer
backwards
with three legs
Poor thing D:
Brandini I cant condone this slave labour
i reward it with bytes and nibbles though
what about buckets of chicken?
what about chicken buckets
isn't there a conversion for bytes/nibbles to chicken buckets or something?
something
i dont remember the details
lol
lol we'll have to ask thal
so I'm for sure making my newest game idea for embedded games
in unity
which will be cool
cause then I'll have more experience with unity so I can make my other games at some point
whatcha gonna make?
that game idea I texted you that alex drew on lol
i dont remember it
explain it in 12 words or less
temple run with cars, inspired by reno-LV drive
man I knew 12 was too high
shoulda said 5
lol
temple run with cars would have been sufficient
damn
two words
shoulda said explain with only names of food
car runner
ooh
umm
are there any cars named after food?
hmm
fiesta is related to eating food
several named after fish
like what
why does that article exist? no clue
ford pinto
lol
a pinto is a horse isn't it?
also a bean
idk
but still
lets go with the bean
pinto roll chicken squash
temple run dont hit the other things or you get squashed
is the translation
(with cars)
lol
it's a bit of a stretch
definitely
so how's the list that angie gave you to work on?
well
it needs common-play 1.7
but if I use 1.7, it breaks stuff
lol
but if I use less than 1.7, it doesnt work
so you're fixing broken stuff from the 1.7 update
well
because it didn't work in the first place?
lol
i updated it to 1.7
but 1.7 isnt backwards compatable
aha
at least not fully
so
my module works
but the tests for the project as a whole fail
so basically what you're saying is your stuff works, so its no longer your problem?
well, it is my problem
ah
because my PR is failing to compile
GG
idk how to fix
that project sounds horrible btw
like really
it takes at least 90 minutes to rerun the tests
so
i cried a little and got taco bell
you need a new awesome laptop that runs tests in seconds
the tests are run on the cloud though
but yes i need a new laptop
lol
they need a lightning powered cloud
super duper quick
36 days or less until I am done with AL
that's promising
know what your project is for after yet?
nope
doesn't matter; not AL
hopefully not something horribad
so we were just chatting in the office about amnesia and SOMA and horror games in general
one guy pulled up a video of an occulus rift horror game he played
oculus comes out really soon
yep
lol
it was super simple
like game maker level of detail in the world and game mechanics
but he said it was scary
also the rift is Q1 
still scary as shit because it's so real
lol
yeah
it's september
that's like five months
its august!
it's the 35th
er
wow
25th
aug 35
thats still half a year away
because i assume end of q1
in some alternate universe that's definitely a possibility
eh, idk, they released a lot of stuff that hinted at earlyish q1 at gamescom
according to the elite dangerous community that went anyway
they're pretty psyched
i am intrigued by Steam/HTC's VR stuff
it seems superior
steams is supposed to be decent
Sony's is supposedly the best to come
sony's is PS4 only though right?
I don't think so
but maybe
i thought it was
ah
yes it is
Steam seems to have the best tracking
it tracks your location in the entire room, not just orientation
so you can walk around the room/game nevironment
also it has dual hand controllers
that's nice
imagine amnesia, where you actually use your hands to open doors and pick stuff up
#fuckthatshitimouttahere
lol
hiding in a locker
dude finds you in locker
ded
rl
hand glitches and sends the door flying open
GG
heart attack
so many people with heart conditions are going to use vr, get their shit wrecked, and attempt to sue to no avail because the warnings are sufficiently given and they just ignored them
so
so
how have your classes been
meh
not bad
no more video game party :(
lol
just in-class presentations
the video game party was kinda lame anyways
other than the free food
yeah but now we have to finish early because presentations are the week before finals instead of the day of
at least Unity is ezpz so you should be able to finish no problem
yeah
i'll probably be done way before and have time to make it actually good
I wonder if you can put ads on unity games
or how
you can, but idk how
I've looked for tutorials and haven't found anything nice for android development with unity
everything is super basic
dont you just make it like normal and then click the android button? with maybe some special code for touch screen/accelerometer controls
you basically use generic "left function" options instead of saying "a" or "left arrow"
H
ah
yeah, and it uses accelerometer or whatever you have your unity options set to (customizable and set automatically during compile)
is dascalu teaching both semesters of senior projects this year?
i'm not sure
they haven't released next semester's stuff for the most part
if you're lucky he wont
lol
that bad?
if he does, prepare to have a ton of unnecessary lectures and a ton of copy/paste assignments
we had like 5 lectures, but dascalu normally has a lecture every class
yeah he seemed to like talking so much that he didn't have enough air for the amount of words he was attempting to release
haha
we got his life's story
it was boring
lol
did he tell you about how he and monica went to college together?
in romania or whetever
"ah yes I taught monica in Romania but we didn't know it until much later and then we though hmm that must have been a thing"
lol
yep
he then went to canada
and got his phd
you forgot to add a pause in the middle for him to breathe
and was overqualified
so he went into teaching
overqualified so he teaches now
hmmm
and got a letter of recommendation from the author of the classes book
lol
so unr hired him
he's so caught in the past
and the reason he chose here was because dr varol told him to go to Tahoe and "the rest was history"
lol yes
I had to listen to the whole story twice
since I was also in HCI
yeah
that would be horrible
how was hci?
waste of time
lol
it was like the mini version of senior projects
you make a project but it doesnt have to be complete, just have some user interfaces basically
and do all the same paperwork that you do in SP
gross
apparently some of the guys here ordered caffein things for e-cigs
instead of nicotine, it has caffeine
lol that sounds bad for you
eww
that sounds...insane
and hello
Hello!
HI!
so my mom just 90% fell for this scam: http://www.welivesecurity.com//07/19/support-desk-scams-clsid-not-unique/
gave the dude remote access and everything
then called me
and i told her to turn her computer off immediately and call microsoft
(microsoft because I didnt feel like talking her through googled solutions)
gg
yep
they acted like they were microsoft support, and that her pc was sending error reports by the millions
they tried to get her to buy windows 10, antivirus, and some security package for 150 bucks
the scammer did or MS did?
scammer
she's on hold with MS
I figured they'd be able to tell her how to undo the remote access
you home already?
yes
i think it might be RL time soon
I'M DOWN
at least til i have to go get alex at 815
im playing arma
eww

dear steam:
just because I play rocket league does not mean I enjoy every permutation of sports game, and recommending them all to me on the front page is not going to make that change.
thanks,
Andrew
lol
you know what really grinds my gears?
wut
when someone asks a question and punctuates it with a period
it just instantly makes me hate them
lol
well does it bother you if it happens by accident.
not if it is by accident
but if it is just a way to make a demand seem more like a request, then it bothers me
interesting
you working from home today?
nein
I have basically all day off
just design patterns at 4
guess I could set up android unity development and put a test app on my phone
meanwhile I will wait an hour for this to compile
lol
rocket league would be such a good thing to do while compiling
short games so right when it finishes you can hop off
instead I am just listening to moosik
lamme
I already browsed everything new on reddit within the first 15 minutes of being awake today
lol
well, it compiled. I accidentally compiled the wrong module though
GG me
i fell off a roof in Arma last night trying to use a ladder
and lived
new airbags confirmed?
i went from 100% to 43% health and used an instadoc as fast as I could
it was a little touch and go for a moment though
lol
the new ETA for my car is Friday
if they work hard and dont hit any snags
x_x
good stuff
they added 2 more trader locations
and vehicle wrecks and corpses now despawn after 15 minutes
holy frak
git just saved my life
i very nearly deleted the last week worth of work I did
nice
so i've decided that eelke is the worst teacher at the university when it comes to conveying content in a lecture
lol why?
we just had a lesson on OO and UML basics, and he practically read the slides virbatim, didnt really know what he was doing with eclipse when he was trying to show us stuff, and he couldnt figure out how to get violet to run for UML
YOURE TEACHING A FUCKING CLASS ITS YOUR JOB TO KNOW THESE THINGS
grr
well, eclipse is gross
It seemed aight
no man
messed with it
it is gross
what would you use?
a text editor
for java?
or intellij
yes
I use intellij for certain things on this scala project
what's so bad with eclipse?
it is just gross
bloated, slow, ugly, confusing, gross
lol it seemed pretty useful to me
intellij is like 9000x better
when was the last time you tried it?
like 2 or 3 years ago
i'm pretty sure they've had several updates since then lol
yes but it is still gorss
gorss
i even had this conversation with some of the other people working on AL
so gross that the disgust switched the letters
we came to the conclusion that eclipse is gross
lol
well
but yeah I typically just use a text editor
gotcha
I only use intellij to manage my imports
because it underlines unused imports
lol
lol
you home yet?
no
lame
llama
im about to head home
do eet
RL time bro
but what about armamamama
RL > armamamamra
but we gotta get materials to build a base
if i try, and I get shot and killed, or mortally wounded with no recourse within the first ten minutes, i'll never play that game mode again
what a quitter
it's just not fun
lol
you know nothing ap menard
if I wanted a base building, shooter simulation, i'd want one with a better interface and not derp player physics
the player physics are fine
its the ladder physics you gotta look out for
have you tried vaulting?
yeah
or ladders
lol
that's what I mean
ladders are a class of their own
those are just death
see
thats what stairs are for
reason #531 not to play arma: ladders
haters gonna hate
i'm hatin
you hate us cuz you anus
just go home already lol
i cant go home if you keep talking to me
stop keeping me here!
(ok omw home)
oh wait
gotta wait like 30 seconds
someone else just left and if I leave now we'll have to awkwardly walk beside each other
ok that's enough time
bye
Hallo
hi
Hi
HELLO
heyo
hiya
hi
hi
nao
can i use your air compressor / gauge for tires?
i suppose
my pressure hasn't equalized it seems
right meow?
today?
doesn't have to be now
in light would be nice
meow is fine
ok can i head over meow
garage is available
my mom is at my gma's place
you can head over right meow
coo
coo
tqoo

ughhhhh
i walked down some stairs and died
instantly
They really need to fix their damage models
stairs OP
and the aggressive loot killing
I'd rather war thunder
aggressive loot killing is fixed
in next update
which is friday
not soon enough
2/10 ugly gamemode
the gamemode is fun, but the random deaths need to be fixed
for when I get my new work laptop
that pirate ship
i like the style of the pirate ship
but I also realllly like space ships
i think the trek one is awesome
the light is in the wrong spot though
that's not a nacelle
well they only have 1 light and asymetry is the devil
well yeah
i was just saying, my vote is for the trek, but it does have a problem so idk
those the only options?
nah anything is an option if it is cool
the deflector could theoretically glow like that though
if they just put it on a modulated phase shift variant
oh maybe they parsed the nano-grid and rerouted the stream
exactly
goddamn this tuna i made is awesome
tuna, celery, onion, mayo, mustard, black pepper, garlic powder, cayenne pepper
in that order
while this is cool, their list of "functions" is a bit retarded
18 tools in 1! including a cuticle pusher, carrot peeler, and lottery scratcher!
a knife can do those three things
we need to do a kickstarter for a brushed metal cube
think of all the thinks it can do
you can use it as a 3d alignment device
as a weight
paperweight 3d alignment
draw dots on it for a dice
(erasable!)
lottery scratcher
doorstop
put it in the freezer then take it out as a way to keep stuff cool in your lunch box
acoustic attention-getter
stuff smasher
magnet holder
*stackable!
in 37.5 different colors
each side can be custom colored
ok i need sleep i am exhausted
it like just hit me
guh
nearly as many combinations as there are combinations of flavors at Sonic!
yes!
get the special glass edition if you pledge $100 or more
32 possible color combos if we allow color/no color
lol
glass edition includes light refraction capabilities
glass edition can be used to magnify stuff
and also start fire if there is sunlight
shoots rainbows at random!
get the plush version! can be used as a pillow
lol
tiniest pillow
okbed
nite
thank you for air bird
night
you kids are coocoo

@mez http://i.imgur.com/oDtPIpB.png
vgh
haha that one is great
new starbound update looks like a cool one
Oh?
it's almost up to terraria 1.0 standards
lol
make a colony (have npc's come into player-built homes)
I still like the multi-world thing though
i'll definitely have to play it again at some point in the far future
hi
hi
so AI is going to be really fun I think
we're programming in python like every class starting next week
and we have to make a machine learning project (nothing too scary but if it's good enough it's job-worthy stuff)
and you have to discuss the paper
during the voted upon timeslot
lol looking at our piazza page hmm?
sneakybeaky
it emailed me
oh haha you're still enrolled on piazza
he seems to be reusing last years piazza class
seems that way
funny
if i remain on there I am going to lurk and ask you random pop quiz questions
vgh

so it looks like my car will probably not be ready tomorrow
what a surprise
was it because they didnt work hard enough or because something went wrong?
they gave it to the guy to do the stripe
and the guy didnt do it till the end of the day
so it just sat there waiting most of the day instead of being worked on
the new ETA for my car is Friday
if they work hard and dont hit any snags

so they didnt work hard

so we had our internal angies list meeting/update today
apparently AL is hurting bad
They are advertising like crazy
so no surprise
they have been negative for over a year, their CEO left 3 months ago, they are making huge budget cuts, they have withdrawn all standing job offers, and are going to terminate half of their contract workers next friday
wow
Sounds like nearing bankruptcy
and they are now pushing to launch their work in progress code, which isnt entirely finished and is kinda crappy
in order to make themselves look better
so they can attempt to sell the company
so there's a chance I'll be off of AL by Friday next week :D
awesome
anyone want to do some late night RL?
i want to do some early night sleeping
lame
lol
it seems excessive to have a wire going to each stick of (presumably) dynamite
they would all detonate if just one detonated

oh
i see
well you are correct
i am bored
lol
whatcha doin?
nothing
i finished all of the work AL has for me
I have 4 pull requests waiting on code review
they have been waiting for code review for weeks
and I am waiting on someone to help me do this last endpoint because i have no clue how to do it
so in the mean time i am making pyramids out of . and ,
lol
well then
you really need to get approval for gaming "in the meantime"
lol
i am looking at esoteric programming languages
youtube is strangely slow right now
this is hello world
DO ,1 <- #13
PLEASE DO ,1 SUB #1 <- #238
DO ,1 SUB #2 <- #108
DO ,1 SUB #3 <- #112
DO ,1 SUB #4 <- #0

PLEASE GIVE UP
this is also hello world
(=<`#9]~6ZY32Vx/4Rs+0No-&Jk)"Fh}|Bcy?`=*z]Kw%oG4UUS0/@-ejc(:'8dc
why in the world would you ever, ever use that
I would paste hello world in Whitespace but you wouldnt be able to see it
that seems like the definition of what I'm going to find in hell when I die
haha
both are joke languages
the second one was designed to be hard to use
the guy who wrote the compiler for it never wrote any programs with it
the first one is funny
the first one is kinda funny
you have to use the correct number of pleases
too many, it says you are being insincere, too few and you are not being polite enough
lol
someone at IBM is apparently making a language where you program with different lengths of churros
hello world:
{o}==========} {==={*} {o}} {======{o} {o}=} {={o} {o}} {====={o} {o}=}
{======{o} {o}===} {={o} {o}=} {====={o} {o}==} {======{o} {o}=======} {={o}
{o}==} {====={o} {o}===} {======{o} {o}=========} {={o} {o}===} {====={o}
{o}====} {======{o} {o}==========} {={o} {o}====} {====={o} {*}=} {={o} {===={*}
{{o} {o}==} {======{o} {o}==} {={o} {========{o} {o}====} {======{o} {o}=} {={o}
{========{*} {o}=======} {={o} {========{*} {========{*} {o}===} {={o}
{========{*} {o}=} {======{o} {o}==} {={o} {========{o} {o}===} {======{o}

{={o} {========{*} {*}========} {={o} {========{*} {o}=} {======{o} {o}===}
{={o} {========{o} {o}} {======{o} {========{*}
that's totally making me hungry
churros sound amazing now
i ordered yellow curry for lunch today
not sure what to expect
i usually get chicken satay
yellow curry is usually very strong
so hopefully you like curry
lol
so
that first language, INTERCAL, also has bug forgiveness
if a line of code causes a compilation error, it will forgive you and skip it
without giving any warning or error message
lool
wow
<<<<>>>>
<<<___>>>

you should make a language based on making pyramids from characters
lol
^ /\ v
that's an if statement
you can only increment or decrement. ^ is +1 v is -1
lol
all variables are different size pyramids
division is done by a half pyramid: /
multiplication is done by a double pyramid //\\
new task: make it also a functional language
a program is ended with the pyramids of giza
and started with a pictograph of the sun
  \/
>()<
  ^
sun
lol
so egyptian
I will name the language
uhh
(literally uhh)
haha
idk how you'd write hello world with that though
well you'd need an in/out stream pyramid, so maybe use sideways pyramids for those
>
>>
>
and
 <
<<
 <
then you have to have your variables incremented to the correct ascii code

and use the out stream pyramid with a pyramid of 'C' for character output
CC
CCC
CC
1678987654321
all numbers will need to be pyramid numbers
like above
14321
65432
345676543
456787654
567898765
456787654
345676543
65432
14321
a better pyramid number
that's 9
it is better than other languages because when you see a number in a program you know the author really meant it, because it is too much work to accidentally write a number
unless the number is 0
lol
i get my mustang back in about an hour
woo!
hiya
he got it back
woo
is it nice?
still?
or does it feel like a wounded race horse that needs to be given the lead sleeping pill?
that came out more morbid than I was expecting
at least i'm talking to myself
that's the good news
the bad news is that i'm talking to myself
whelp
Andrew has gone crazy errybody
did that just happen?
i have marbles if you need
i'm actually a few cards short of a full deck if you have some
he does have marbles
lol
no rly
but yeah, it is nice still
like
i found my old marbles
no lead sleeping pill required
cool
rocket league?
or i can work on my cloak
maybe

lol
i am on mac
eww
I’m setting up hammerspoon
hammerspoon huh
interesting
yup
i gotta say this hardware is like 9000x better than my work lenovo
the mac’s keyboard isn’t as good
but the screen is really nice
not to mention it's a mac so its basically un-usable
:F
its more usable than linux
honestly though i just want to put stickers on it
and have a nice high-res screen
how are you guys spending your saturday? I spent mine getting plastered. http://imgur.com/SEhoqjY
I liek trainz
i like turtles
do we need to call the turtle patrol to check the power lines?
wat
Remember? I pointed them out
on the trip
no?
o yes
[y]
yes
no
hey
someone play a game with me so I don't have to be social
war thunder?
hmm
i'd have to install it
lol
er, update
lol
it's been a month or two
Shouldn't be too bad
almost done, just 2gb
pretty quick
yep, done now

there's a Sabaton cruise
and it sold out in 32 minutes
hai
ayyy yo
was playing RL with nova and needed a 3rd
but i'm going to bed now
:F
i am also going to bed soon
indeed
its quiet
too quiet
my body cast is now back in one piece
tomorrow I'll give it another 2 or 3 layers of clear to seal it
then a white base coat :D
what amour you making?
something like that
but it'll be the shitty version
because I dont have nearly as much experience as that guy
i used foam strips cut from the mat it is sitting on along the inside of the two halves to connect them
and extra plaster strips on the outside
or I could do a custom designnnnnn
but I need inspirationnnnn
this is pretty neat
hi
wtf
kanye wants to be president?
Trump/West Ego 
yeah kanye was high when he said that though
nao
You would like "Shotgun" by Klaypex
Andrew may as well
Ian won't
lol I won't?
i had a lot of klaypex on my pandora station back in the day
its dubsteppy
Yes
I just checked
Its wub/wub
my songs wub me
Funk song
same name
That I know
lol
so
what's everybody up to
I am now listening to funk
funkehtown
That's disco
Funk is very different
lol
Disco is Funk + Pop + Salsa
At least traditional disco
applying
applying
applying
mez
this game is fun
You don't like being in mob employ?
lol
but are you aptly applying appliances
i can't stand being expected to know something just because they gave me responsibility over it
it's just like Brand
and I quit from there
not resigned
quit
like
"i'm out"
You quit your job?
Brand
well
no
but
"I'm resigning."
When?
then she' slike "I accept"
ah
dude 2 jobs ago
Brand
not ABC Hyundai
oh
That's what I was confused about
Brand, the chick who tried to short me $300 on taxes
D:
yeah she didnt seem nice
wasn't
Also for those interested in the differences:
Soul: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGJQPkfwlAc
Funk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxJFjO4Skgo
Disco: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CycTQ29ikAA
Also rappers seem to love to sample all three genres for some reason
bcuz rap
Also
Smooth Jazz is a direct decendant of Funk
That's the halfway line
hi
hi
halp
plah
i just put the first layer of white on my body mold
soon it will be ready for designinginging
hm
I'll be honest.
aboot
I want to apply to one of these "Webmaster" positions with a picture of Spiderman.
betteryet
like that's my resume
show up for an interview in a spiderman costume
that is it
no
too much
not enough
needs to be just a touch of insanity
that is tony
as webmaster
no shit
the pic i was just about to use
lol
just "So I heard you need a Webmaster."
well i did it
spiderman
ftw?
if it shows up on reddit you know who did it
i bet you'll get the job
maybe
fingers crossed
it'll work just fine
show up in at least a spider man suit and covered in silly string
no
wish me luck on those
we'll see how it turned out
honestly that last one was me out of fucks to give
but those usually work out for the better
lol
for some strange reason
nite!
also we need to make an app lol
i'd like to make an app that says what musical key one is in with just a few notes
nite
that'd be cool
is it feasible?
idk the mathematics behind it or how well it works in practice
so maybe
lol i'm down to try
at least the design aspect
i even have a GUIdea
lol
right now i am focused on my costume build, so it'll probably have to wait until after I get that mostly done
oh no worries
not ina  rush for it
it's for funsies
i also wanna see that costume at some point
da
well
right now it is a box of foam
WOW
OH BOY
and a plaster sizing/shaping form
yeah that was interesting
lol
you could say I
got plastered
ayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyylmao
lol
lol ok
must sleep
have to kind of funciton tomorrow
and hate life
for another 8 hours
tah~
good luck
o/
thx
o/
the musical key would be interesting
you'd have to get a few notes in a row, so limit it to a time frame
then with the collected data you'd look at the frequencies you've been given, sort through the noise, and make correlations based on the changes/nonchanges is frequency
the problem you'd find is if you got more than one key in a single sample
you could probably just do it in real time I'd think
well the problem with that is you're not really looking at the "key" then
you're looking at the note
say you have two keys coming up
the two keys are composed of three notes
hmm yes, I was thinking notes
note A, note B, and note A are played. the first A is from a previous key, the BA is the next key
so yeah
if you made a good enough tool it'd probably be useful for musicians
well for something like guitar that would be less of an issue right?
kind of
now you're thinking chords
because you dont really change key on a guitar mid song do you?
you can
in complicated pieces you do
a lot
dont you have to adjust the knobs?
not necessarily
that's just pitch
but i thought that changed the key
A musical key is a song's home. The key tells you several things about a song: the sharps and flats used, the scale the song is based on, the scale note that serves as is the song's home note, and much more.
it's based mostly on the actual notes used
so with a guitar, you would have two different keys if you only played with three of six strings, than if you used the other three (probablY)
yeah i dont know much about music theory lol
lol
band in high school
but yeah
that's why you'd need a sample
you could probably train an AI to do it
give it a piece, see if it can define sections, and the key in each section
if sound wasn't so annoying to deal with mechanically/programmatically I'd be inclined to do that for my AI project
do it
use python
import sound
we have to use python
lol
does it have an ezpz sound library?
just import musicalkeyartificialintelligence
aha
right
lol
there's a python library for everything
I'm going to write an AI that tells you what deck your opponent is likely playing in hearthstone based on current popular decks
shoulda seen that coming
so possibly a combination of a web crawler and a game-interface AI
have you ran that by Richard yet?
not yet
but I have tons of other ideas if that doesnt work
I dont know what the scope of your project is
basically: we have to write an AI in python
but that seems like more of a statistics problem, with a self updating table
which is essentially classical AI
but he may want something more indepth
the level of programming expected of us: an example he gave was identifying types of iris based on data sets given and picture data
oh did you see that thing that repaints pictures in different styles?
not yet
that sounds cool
it was on reddit last night
is it an AI?
yeah
oh nice
woah
that's amazing
yeah it's really good
richard would probably like that, if he hasnt already seen it
you should throw it up on piazza
lol
lol
i think im not on it any more
i havent gotten any emails beyond that one
lame
lol
imma post it
cause it's awesome
dooo it
oh also idk if originate is going to the career fair this year
they are moving to more digital recruiting
including via piazza
interesting
well
that's fine I guess
lol
apparently obama is going to spend a day in alaska with Bear Grylls
"well now, bear, usually I try and diplomatically solve my problems, but when a moose charges you say we should drink our own piss? That doesn't seem very diplomatic to me"
i watched a few episodes of Running Wild with Bear Grylls today
good stuff?
he made his guest pee in a cup, stuck a dead mouse in it, boiled it, and they ate/drank it
noty
he said it was the worst thing he has ever had to eat
that's the worst thing I'd nope right out of eating
he really just seemed like some creeper who has a fetish for consuming other people's pee
when he was explaining to her that she had to pee in the cup
lol
he probably does honestly
it's what he's known for now
hot pee just sounds soooo unpleasant
especially in a hot environment
I just paid 600$ to get 441$ American
but thise american dollars are infused with freedom
and probably some drugs
and possibly sweat from strippers
it smells like rancid ink
lol
you coming to america?
Yeah lol
right meow?
Im visiting Vegas again, on the 23rd I fly in
thats so long from now
what are you going to do with all that american money until then?
There is no way I waiting until the end of the month
last month the exchange rate was 1.25, now it is 1.36, and its only going to get worse. weve declared a recession
ah
im crying now lol
it will be far worse by the time I go xD
This is why you guys should visit me
you would actually be making money
but canada is cold
it isn't until november
what is there to do in canada?
You sound just like Ian
pshaw
away with you
theres lots to do
but i actually want to know :(
depends on what you want to do
theres lots to do in calgary
nothing in edmonton
and you can get lost both metaphorically and literally, out in kanaskis country
how does one get lost metaphorically?
one can be metaphorically lost in the wilderness, by being consumed by the beauty of nature, and/or having a strong emotional experience.
i see
sounds fun
Canada Brandini...cooooome to canadaaaaaa
last time I was in canada a horde of naked people flew by on bikes
haha must have been a good day
lol
it was unexpected
So what is there to do in Vegas?
well
you can get lost both physically and metaphorically in the desert
i dont recommend getting lost physically in the desert though
you might die
You can die in nature? wow.
so amazing.
yup
I never knew.
lol
there is also
uhh
tourist stuff
such as?
sight seeing
shows
and
gambling
its a good thing I go to vegas for the food
i mean]
the people
yes
you guys.
not the food.
you eat people?!
xD
>: D
you know it's a bad sign when you make a bunch of code changes, and it just works
that means it will explode later, when I least expect it
lol good.
just the best.
you can see the burns coming.
watching all those bear grylls episodes makes me want to go backpacking
hearing about those bear grylls episodes makes me want to never watch him make pee soup with rat
it was pretty enjoyable to watch
eww...
if it's not me eating/drinking the disgusting substance, then it is enjoyable
remind me to never let you cook for me then
blended taquitos are gourmet, dammit
lololol
theyre SO good
at least we know the truth, Andrew

tell me a story
using emotes
exclusively
i dont seem to have half those emotes
lol
they're new ones
so if you havent updated then you wont have them
im on linux man
ahhhh
that's why
you gotta give me a year to catch up
lol
my guess is that the story is about heart break leading someone to depression, drinking, and ultimately death by jihad
yep
idk but that might win a pulitzer
probably
man reddit is down/slow
i just finished what i had to work on
but i gotta wait 30 minutes
so traffic isnt terrible
aint nobody got time for traffic
people are crazy
so the fewer drivers i have to drive near, the better
i saw a car attempt to occupy the same area in space as another car again today
yeah seriously, crazy people going straight when you have a green but yield left turn
right?!
i dont claim to not be crazy
lol
i try not to be
but sometimes, it slips through
you can't fix crazy
or can you
dun dun dun
! ! !
i want a panini
but on non flaky bread

arma 3 dayz exile looks cool
I play Exile
it needs tons of work
dayz exile?
wat
no zombies
dayz exile
Zombies = -10 points
whatever this map is, it is beautiful
huh
neat
the bandaging system in dayz exile looks cool
you can bandage someone's head, or leg, or whatever
depending on how they are damaged
i guess this is based on Exile, but with zombies and some new features such as bandaging and cell phones
by the by how's the car
its good
i have to bring it back to the shop tomorrow
WHY
they scratched the tint on the passenger side quarter window
so they are gonna re-tint it
i also found a ~2 inch scratch on the windshield
that wasnt there before it went to the shop
murder time
on the bright side, i just put the last coat of paint on the plaster body form
so i can start designing/cutting tomorrow
nice
sonuva
kill the shop
well, they are retinting the quarter window for free
lol
the scratch should be fixable too
they picked up your mustang in broad daylight, and they scratched it.
twice
well it was in the shop for 2 months
and completely taken apart and put back together
plenty of time for it to get scratched
ahah
Arguably you're lucky there weren't more scratches.
yeah
there's no scratches on the body at least
At least you are not Russian driver.
Russia driver
da
if I was in russia I would walk or take public transport
or I'd just leave russia
Nobody is safe in Russia.
Except Putin
Aint Nobody got time to crash into a man riding his bears down the highway.
Brandini. You should have just got yourself a Grizzly Bear to ride. It would have eaten all of the witnesses to the accident.
they poop too much though
Who care?
Who?
me
wai
i dont want to have to pick up bear poo
you know what you do when someone care?
they get eaten.
i'd get eaten then
that's terrible
and then I would become poo
thats even worse
lol
sounds pretty shitty actually
bah
pun scum
Russia sucks
whoa now comrade.
Slavs suck
That's not what Putin would want to be hearings.
$15/month
not sure if I like socks that much
yeah that seems pretty pricy for something that i'm able to find and get on my own
I buy my own socks
Cause I'm picky
I buy large packages of socks so I don't have to get more
like, ever
I buy dress socks
you wear dresses?
buh bum tis
You know what dress socks are
pshh
would I really disregard logical conclusions for the sake of a petty joke?
Yes.
well fine then!
White socks are bad for most non-outdoors wear
i dont own white socks
well
er
hm
you know what
no joke
that is an acceptable use of Comic Sans
that isnt comic sans
if you're talking about what I think you are
what is it
Comic Neue?
lobster
inspect it
you can see the font
there is no way that's lobster
inspect it
i know the code says it lol
but
....no i know lobster
if it says it. it is it
i know
but
that ain't right
that ain't fucking lobster
Tony doubts the code!
it is lobster cursive with weight 700
i doubt the code
the code doesnt lie
the code doesn't lie but...
you don't see years of that shit and just forget it man
that is not lobster
i know lobster
that is comic sans
i know comic sans
oh
it is indeed comic sans
if you scroll all the way down in the computed styles box
WHABAM
OH
SON
evil
so evil
I wonder if he realizes it's comic sans
that had to have been intentional
well no
because Lobster is super trendy
it looks like he just isnt importing lobster
could be
also I find it so strange that you know like every font under the sun
no just the overused ones
like 5 times now random fonts have been mentioned and you knew them
Lobster, Comic Sans, and Bleeding Cowboys are what you use when you don't know what to use.
lol
i know my stuff
I can scroll through like 6 pages of fonts and find one I like, and you know it
every time
XD
lol yeaaaaaah
(tell Origin)
hmm he is importing lobster
lemme actually inspect inspect it
insecure stylesheet
you cant really secure a style sheet
so
lol
the request is going to block it otherwise
wait
lobster cursive
cursive isn't....a thing
cursive is the fallback font I believe
which is comic sans
he needs to choosel ike
SErif
get that professionalism
no, that's perfectly valid CSS
oh
well
cursive is the closest fallback font to lobster
that I know of
He's only actually pulling one font from google fonts
Lato
huh
i guess
cursive is
genuine
weird
at least, that's what Chrome is telling me
like i was saying though
That seems like an acceptable use almost
like
it's thick
curvy
looks "plush"
UNLESS
i still want to find out why the font isnt working though
you're doing a "Super" series
I'd suggest making Comfy in comic sans
but then just having "socks" at the end feels imbalanced
true
but do you want super COMFY socks or SUPER comfy socks
well ok
nevermind
i want SUPER
also
lol
if he wants to be ahead of the game
use the sequel
flavor of Lobster without the copying of errybody
I will suggest that to him tomorrow
but first I must solve the mystery
he's clearly telling it to import
he's also doing <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lato:300,400,700,300italic,400italic,700italic"> in his <head>
my guess is that is overwriting the other fonts
ew spans
?
THESE STUPID ANGIES LIST TESTS
GOD
this build has failed to pass like 5 times
I know the build has no errors because a downstream branch passed just fine
but it is STUPID
it was going to pass first try but some REATARD at angies list canceled it mid-run
without asking and with no explanation why
why
what
what
umm
on that note
does finding a key wiht a few notes sound good?
Wow!
Thanks!
Nice Shot!
OMG!
I just went on a 15 game win streak in 1v1 ranked and am now skill level 832 (was 235 or something)
funny enough I never had anyone get super ragey either
hax
nop
it was really subpar play by all of my opponents
but it got progressively better (as you'd expect)
very last game went to overtime
lol
this is some bad smelling tape
What does it smell like?
Your Mum?
it smells kinda like the smell of sweat and grime that has been hidden under a flap of fat for a week
only more tangy
like its infected?
eww
it is terrible tape
won’t stick at all
i found some scotch tape that is working much better and doesn’t stink
oh the celophane stuff?
i know that tape
i know that smell
nah
its just blue painters tape
then i dunt understund
yeah that stuff doesnt smell bad to me usually
maybe you had it soaking in rat piss stew or something
amaranthe is doing another us tour this fall
hello whoever just signed on
yur mum
no ur mum
lmao
this guy made a freudian slip on his git commit message
"merged morible-team-4"
instead of "mobile-team-4"
i pointed it out to him and he just said "LOLOLOLOL freudian slip"
I finally know how much my ticket is
How much
....uh oh
must be a long number
wait there's a Star Trek online
what
whaaaat
it's bad
well
it's not great
yeah brandon is still trying to get his computer to display the number
it's that big
either that or it's big enough that he had to sell his computer
and his soul
hm
feedback loop error
just amplify the phase shift and reroute the transposer
...yes
Don't forget to frogblast the ventcore
So how much is that ticket
it was like tree fiddy
no really
yes
really
$350?
ish
For which one?
Red light?
first
How about #2
(it was green but yes)
about two fiddy
Did you have your court date or something?
no
well
first one went to court
i had mr. craig p kenny go for me
ah
first one got reduced to a parking ticket
So you only have 1 moving violation
da
You can only haz 1 per year
what happens if you has 2
Well
I say one per year
but
I say that because that's how the license works
You can have 4
in a 4 year renewal period
if you have more
You to traffic school
i think i have to do 5 hours of traffic school anyways
for #2
Ah possibly
Perhaps that will write off that count then
not sure
That's up to the judge
"Traffic School 1 Citation 5 Hour Requirement (0 PT)
Points Upon Completion of 5 Hour Traffic School"
is what it says
that clock is a 0 in parenthesis
So the judge has been nice to you
lol
nice
i saw it wasn't a clock
because i dont' have the emoji bs
then how did you see it was a clock
i misspoke
AHA!
caught red-tongueded

that just makes the time you have left seem more painful
ooh, 17 actually
not counting today
lol
know what you're working on after yet?
nein
lamme
so how much machine learning do you remember?
lol
whelp
I'm trying to figure out what kind of algorithm i'd use to do my AI project on my own since we're not even touching machine learning algorithms until like next week on thursday
and I feel like I need a head start
feed forward recurrent network
i mean
feed forward neural network
I have no clue if it fits but it popped in my head
lol
lol
i extended the rocket league 1's streak to 22 total games, then lost in overtime to an asshole who was spamming thank you the whole time
lol
Wow!
Wow!
rage quit so hard i nearly broke my headset
Wow!
lol
Wow!
turns out controllers are harder than headsets
Wow!
Thanks!
Wow!
OMG!
Wow!
Nice shot!
Thanks!
What a save!
FOR THE ORDERRRRR
AGATHAAAAAA
SO SAY WE ALL!
apparently you can use html/css(?) tags in their chat to make underlines and stuff
you sure it isnt like bbcode or something
<b>This is bold!</b>
i dont think there is an html tag for underline
well it reminded me of html tags
oh, there is <u> in html but it was deprecated
html shouldnt be used for styling anyways
well yeah
but in-game chat having that functionality is kinda cool
the answer is 89+
i dropped my phone on my keyboard on accident and that's what it typed
it was also awkwardly loud
lol
89+
okay
good to know
Home early cause the doctor is on vacation :D
89+
oh man
putt putt
freddi fish was great
Hey I set up my computer to host arma missions
if we want to do that
so i now have a working android app made in unity
I just have to make it do stuff now
yee
my phone is bork though
it connects to the computer
/o\
but the data transfer/charging port had some damage a while ago (almost had to replace the phone) so android/unity can't detect it
I can still transfer files manually though
I just can't push/run directly to the phone (which is a cool unity functionality so i'm sad)
i remember having to do stuff to be able to push directly to the phone
i dont remember what, but there was special stuff you have to do
you have to set up the adb server, which connects to your phone, but the adb server can't detect my phone
you have to put your phone in usb debug mode as well, which i have already
yes that sounds right
lol
i spent about 5 hours on it last night lol
wanna play some rocket league?
hmmmmmaayybbee
Wow!
Sorry!
No Problem!
Wow!
pls
Thanks!
Thanks!
Thanks!

for halloween
iumma have n7 mass effect armor
stupid mac has some form of auto correct

very good. carry on.
i will
i hope to have the front of the chest finished this weekend
except for paint
pictures and lots of them please
oh right
i keep forgetting to take pics
or however many you feel xD
you should have been taking some video and made something to put on youtube.
this is gonna take far too long for a video
i’d have to edit a bunch
and aint nobody got time for that
just take some short video every once I  awhile
and then edit something after
maybe later once I am better
this is still a lot of trial and error for me
im sure youre better than some 12 year olds out there
i would hope so lol
then again...there's always that one kid that has rainbows coming out of every inch of their being.
I always hate those kids though
my dermel’s but is hot enough to make smoke on contact with this foam
guess its time to stop for a minute
bit*
yes please don't asphyxiate
or do
ian
no one told you you had to listen to Courtney
you always have to listen to Courtney.

jack does 1 hour episodes
holy shit
kronovi ahs a 91.5 percent winrate

SIMBAHHHHHH

it was really good
texas outlaws had some friggin delicious ribs
and decent cornbread
meh to cornbread
yeah
ribs are normally good though
it was meh
the ribs were really good
I mean I don't like cornbread
lol
I like cornbread and chili
if it's jalapeno cornbread
homemade
by my grandma
also cornbread, sausage and gravy
made by my grandma
she's a good cook
lol
ahh yiss
What am I looking at here?
front of my chest armor
ahh
what kind of foam is that?
EVA foam
Brandon do you have tomorrow off?
yes
ah
you should download two arma mods
overnight
that way we can play things like chenarus
among other stuff
what is the RHS stuff?
RHS adds 1970's, 1980's, and 1990's US and Soviet equipment
Its needed for a lot of servers
and COOP maps
I'll download them tomorrow
kk
because i dont want to leave my computer on
it is too bright to sleep near
fair enough
i stubbed my toe yesterday
i didnt even hit it hard
but it is numb
it has been numb for like 12 hours
ouch
broked
Brandon you start those downloads?
yes
the RHS one finished
woo
other one has 16 hours left
wow

i suppose i need to sketch this out more
hi
sketch what out more
app
prototype
trying pixate
i need to plan before i develop dur
lol
what's the app?
so
the front of my armor is almost done
just gotta heat form it and do the neck guard
nice
they should really make torrents for those arma mods
this dl still has 2 hours left
that's looking good
tanks
it is also taking 5ever to make
lol
i believe it
tanks
Brandon did that download finish?
not yet
wow
super download
they need torrentys
lol typing with gloves
typingys
Also Seal Team sloth is not dead
where was it?
dunno
I'm not on right now but I am told its back up
I also think I might have a cop willing to uhhh
assist us
for a lil chedda

just in time for bed
also my left little toe is still numb
also the downloads finished
woot
now
one more thing
are you ready?
no
darn
tomorrow then
yes
because i must sleep
okie dokie
night
night
hi
Hi
hi
brandon
do you know how to download collections from the steam workshop?
yes
you should download my pack
for arma 3
just search deco
then with that
plus the other mods
we can do stuff
no results for deco
wat
in collections?
its fo show there
direct link
thats a lot of stuff
its worth it
you're worth it
awww
d'awww
i'm sick
and my head hurts
i am tired
me3
and cant feel my toe
ouchie
no ouch
i cant feel it
lol
literally the opposite of ouch
cold?
no
i hit my toe like 2 days ago
and it has been numb ever since
o.O
you should get that looked at
lol
^
it isnt blue and i can move it
it is just numb
still
might not be a bad idea to have it looked at
are you downloading my pack?
yes
the worst that could happen is permanent nerve damage
That's pretty bad
seriously, all that just from downloading deco's pack
yup
I mean i knew it was big but i didnt know it was that hefty
buh bum tis
pssst
brandon
that pack downloaded
yes
want to try it?
not tonight
kk
r/subredditsimulator is pretty great

10/10
lol
I am testing the machine guns in that mod pack
10/10 russians give 0 crap about accuracy
100% about ROF
nothing has a higher rate of fire than a fragmentation grenade
you haven't seen some of these russian machine guns
They are about as accurate as a grenade as well
do they beat Metal Storm?
wat
1m round per minute
nope
you know
it seems excessive
whats the point
lol
completely destroy a single target
doesn't seem that it would be very effective as a combat thing
it would REALLY ruin someone's day
right
1 persons
and everyone behind him
the tecnology is more flexible than just a box of bullets
I could see it as a light anti-tank weapon
it can be used in handheld weapons too
and against vehicles
maybe missile interception
the electronic firing mechanism means it's more reliable
It just doesn't seem like a front line weapon
more like defensive
well, the handheld weapons are cool
they seem like they would be weird to reload
How do you reload
lol
idk
lol
like a musket maybe
beat me to it
lol
lol
interchangable barrels would work
but a barrel for an assault rifle with like 20 rounds would be kinda long
i guess you could do like a quad barrel
with 5 rounds in each
or
you could feed a magazine with one round in the barrel at a time
and it could eject the spent cartridge
and load the next one
with the blowback
well then you're almost right back where you started
lol
just no firing pin
exactly
that's the least reliable part
aint nobody got time for moving parts
electronic firing is a good idea
hi
hai
i
am
bored
watch some kronovi stream
he's OP
is he on now?
yeah
camgears
is that twitch or something else
twitch, username camgears
lol
yeah
he's 2nd from top stream
on rocket league anyway
he's doing ranked 1v1's right now
i wanna see him do 2v2 or 3v3
apparently 1v1 is the best way to get your mechanics down
and after that 2's and 3's is all positioning
aint nobody got time for mechanics
lol
only time for SHUBAM!
lol
the only thing I have to work on at AL is a bug fix, that requires access to another git repo, and I asked for access an hour ago
>_<
and they all went home now
that sounds lame
lol
just go home too
why is this stream like 240p
play RL with me
i'm sick so no class for me
his stream is able to do source quality at 4k
lol
well it looks terrible to me
change the quality settings
i did
or get better internet
im on good internet
refresh stream?
I feel like he should be mexican
or black
just not white
kronovi doesnt sound white
kronovi is a combination of a dota character and a league of legends ultimate name
when you put it that way, it sounds white
lol
see
jesus
what a save
he is amazing
lol
yeah cam fam is pretty good
you should have seen the games he played just before this
dat dribble
he was playing paschy90, one of the other absolute top players in 1v1
the stuff they did was ridiculous
did kronovi win?
they were doing a best of 7 but had to postpone after 5 games cause paschy is EU and it's like 1am. kron was down 3/2 though
they did 4 games on EU servers, and he won the last game they played on NA
I think we're about to watch a youtube video on twitch
lol
lol
gg
so we don't have to do that
lol
dat off the wall turtle
dude is fucking insane
he makes me feel inadequate
he makes me feel inspired
lol
cause I can sometimes pull things off that are a little less cool than the shittiest of kronovi things
lol
the music for that was kinda cool
OH
btw
i watched the first three episodes of jack's grim dawn walkthrough
holy shit
that game
until dawn?
lol
er
yeah
yeah
it is fantastic
i keep mixing those up
like, I want a PS4 just to play various paths of that game
yeah me too
I want to know if it's possible to save more of the characters
cause he gets a lot of them killed
same
lol
especially the two at the beginning
yeah idk about those two
me either
but
it would change it all soo much
yeah
like an entirely different storyline
yeah
well
kinda
actually
yeah
i watched a bit of beef and he also let them die
lemme guess, that happened over three 12 minute episodes?
lol
looks like the next episode from jack will end the series
assuming the game ends at dawn
interesting
well that's when the ranger copters will get there supposedly
so
maybe
i dont remember what happened to matt
Last I saw he was trapped in the mines and whatserbitchface fell pretty far
hmm
lets talk elsewhere incase anyone else here wants to watch it
true true
ello folks
hola
Como estas?
meh
lol
Yo cansado
me3
ok so
if you're interested (you are)
and have recording equipment (you do)
I have helium balloon and will be taking requests
I wonder who he could be talking to
any of you
I'd like to hear another recording of the "suck another dick" line with helium
it'd be funny
>_< called it
lol
don't wanna waaaaste it
lol it's too much
you cant get enough spaghetti
never forgetti
hi
snap back to!... spaghetti
lol lose yourself in your mom's spaghetti
lol
lmao "he blows his own daughter"

hi
howya doin/
my two day headache has finally gone away ^_^
evidently im either allergic or just sensitive to new car smell
me too man, I hate that smell
my mom's car still smells like it and I get a headache every time i'm in it
oh yeesh
it might be leather cleaner
I carpool with one of my coworkers and he has a new car. the stench was strong enough to stick to my mouth and I could actually taste it for about 30 minutes after getting out
yeeeep
me three
I know exactly what you mean
IM NOT ALONE
lol
despite the heat, today we just drove with the windows down and it made everything 1000% better
that would be nice
my dad hates driving with the windows down in the heat
Mad max was good
until dawn is insane
like
best cinematic game since the last of us
o rly
yeah
that's a cool game art
jack frags has a nice immersive playthrough
i meant mad max fury road :P forgot there was a game
the art is amazing
lol
until dawn 10/10
oh hey
rocket league is patching?
yeah 1.5 is out
new rank system
and how does that make you feel?
nice
i'm enjoying it
lol
oy
omg
so beast
guys
ngh
lol that picture
o/
hai
hi
i just read the RL patch notes
I am changing my flag
to
AGATHAAAAAAAAA
or possibly FOR THE ORDERRRRRRRR
lol
alex has her driver's license now :D
woo
does she have car
naw
not yet anyway
she's got a ton saved up
well i can sell her the shittiest corolla you have ever seen
lol
does it run?
forward, yeah
will it run for 5+ years?
no
nothx
it has no reverse
haha wut
lol
or AC
i want another until dawn
me 3
you could watch one of the death scene montages on youtube
gross
watching emily get shot was satisfying
okay that would be nice
lol
someone needs to make an hourlong video of all the ways emily can die
there's only like 2 or 3 ways
dont you get to quicktime control her at some point?
there's probably a couple there
yeah but you dont always die every tiem you fail
lame
the quicktime event when shes running up those conveyor belts can kill her
i dont remember if any others do
so
what kind of car is she gonna get?
no clue
tell her I said not to crash it
i'm going to make her paint it stormtrooper style
lol
my car is already storm trooper colors
but the stripes are more clone wars than anything
I'm like han solo in a storm trooper mask
i shoot first and I manage to hit
not in RL, but in real life
in RL i cant hit anything
lol
today feels like taht for me
i've been playin like shit
i hear the new ranking system is tough
it's fucking tough
lol
what division were you seeded in to?
i've been playing against some insanely good players
and my team is about the same, but i'm playing like crap so people just wreck us
i'm like 50/50 today
win/loss
out of like 10 games
I've seen a lot of people on reddit that were seeded in to bronze I
and are stuck
because their teammates suck that much
I got seeded into silver 1 and my teams are always meh
lol
I wonder where I got seeded
i was silver 1 in everything
you're probably bronze 2 or 3
lol
i was 700 eveerything, you were like 400 everything
i was mid 500's in 2v2
except 1's
orly
i was unranked in 1v1
well then you may be silver
and i was crap in 3v3
silver 1 was like 500-700
{([])}
Ello
hi
ah yes
friday
mom's spaghetti
i bought some chewy sweet tart sour candy
it is so sweet
i am going to get sick
but it tastes so good
lol
like instant diabetes sweet?
yes
oh jebus
dia-beetus
type three adult onset diabeetus
alzheimer's?
Cause that's what you just said
yur mum is alzheimers
No joke
Alzheimers is type 3
but it seems totally different
do people with alzheimers need insulin shots?
I just gave you a link to a peer reviewed medical journal
yes i saw the article
im not going to read all that
The short answer to your question is no
so what defines diabeetus
You need a drug to improve your sensitivity to insulin with Type 3
icee
Diabetes are metabolic diseases resulting from high blood sugar
(over long periods)
There are lots of causes

guten morgen komrade!
i pre-ordered SOMA
eww pre-order
it's the first time I've ever pre-ordered a game lol
wow
I used to all the time for consoles
wanna RL with me and nova?
sure
bout to hop on
I preorded fallout 4
I don't preorder either
i also preordered fallout 4
but my preorders are reserved for only sure plays
soma is a sure play
more than once?
does it matter?
will the doctors come swimming with me while im in vegas?
no
Cause Ian wont :P
0 love 4 public pools
swimming where?
the hotel presumably
which hotel?
New York New york
maybe
ewww swimming with other humans
I swim
in private
swimming is fun
in private
butt
wat
they nerfed the navid :(
its only really accurate now
not a lazer beam
#wrekt
hi
hi
do you remember the networking quizzes at all?
like
maybe
what they were like
I have the first one wednesday
i just crammed every ppt slide in to my memory the hour or two before the test
and I havent gotten to go to the class due to ind study so i'm slightly worried i'm studying weird things
all 5 million slides
yeahh
there are like 700
lol
i never paid attention to his lecture
just go over every slide
that's what i'm doing lol
make sure you pay attention to the slides too
do you need to know the abbreviations/expansion of them?
i went over them with my senior project group, and we went through them slowly
?
like FDM vs TDM aka packet vs circuit switching
yes
the expansion of FDM and TDM arent on the slides shamik, get yo shit together
:F
oh
ifi t isnt on the slides you dont need to know it
maybe it comes up later
he will pick random obscure stuff for quizzes sometimes though
it's literally a slide with a diagram, labelled TDM vs FDM, and there is no explanation of the abbreviation
it's always on the slides somewhere
aight
we definitely learned about TDM and FDM
that image contains basically everything you need to know about both
that's the slide
lol
well there you go
ah but the slide is missing the (Time division Multiplexing) part
do you still understand all this stuff?
what stuff?
networking in general
maybe
just wondering so I could bounce ideas off you or something lol
I don't know anyone else in the class
I probably remember enough to be helpful
aight
so
tdm v fdm
fdm saves a lane for a user and gives them long term access to the packet transfer, tdm gives users bursts of time, so it can have more people sending things per time unit than fdm
sound right?
t and f look really similar
like, the actual t and f characters
F just splits up the frequency range and gives each user a particular range
not the types
er
F
I meant F
lol
yeah
T splits up time, but you get the whole frequency range
It's just 2 different ways of doing multiple things in parallel
well
over one line
right
but each is good for different things
time is more available than frequency
so T is better for more users
and F is better for speed
I suppose, yeah
per user
jeez
kronovi is crazy good
lol
ohhhh
TDM and FDM are both circuit switching
not packet switching
What was the difference between those again?
packet switching takes N users and puts their packets in a queue to be sent
circuit switching is limited by frequency/time space, but gives users faster/guaranteed delivery
circuit switching makes a call connection, basically reserving a line from src to dst
packet just takes the nearest packet in queue and tosses it at the destination
hey he gained 1 rank point
lol yeah, that's apparently "able to rank up" for him
standard is the only place he can
lol
you know it's broken when kronovi can't rank up
you know it's broken when people kro plays with lose like 30 points when they lose
and the people that win gain like 10
and then kro beats them in a rematch, gets 0 and his teammates get like 2
lol self goal
lol that kickoff
this is a good game
yeah too bad it is like 240p for me :(
thats so weird
it's 1080 for me
whelp, i've now been through 50 slides, only 75 more to go
i didnt realize "source" was an option
I was like 25 in when I first said hi
oh
yeah
I was on "high"
it is a bit better now
lol
I always do source
lol
still some artifacting, but much better
yeah
me too
little issues, he says it's the school
their internet anyway
so
yeah
imagine if his school just decided to block steam or something
lol
lol he'd be screwed
something i've noticed that kro's team never does: they never get the ball stuck in their own corner for more than like one hit
that seems like a key to success
how do they avoid that?
they always hit the ball hard, or pass it to someone who can
like
sometimes we'd hit the ball over the center kinda weakly, they do that too, but they always have someone there to hit it hard tot eh other side
kro also goes on the wall to get corner stuff
which would be useful
loool
"so excited that poop's coming out of him" -gibbs on kro's roommate
lol
he's trying so hard not to say the jokes are horrible so he keeps getting more money lol
wanna play some 2's?
sure
Brandon Worl

we could do something like
the week after
cuz by then SOMA will be out
lol i'm down
we can do that
imma do a solo playthrough with headphones/darkness first though, so imma leave it up to you/whoever else to play
lol
ok
also
i can't invite people
i can just do random invite
yeah we werent sure if that would also let people that guests invite invite other people
understandable
so just like tell people you know
sounds good
since we don't want like Statewide people to invite random friends of theirs
understandable
erm
DO YOU REALLY UNDERSTAND IT?!
yes
I can be made a host
OR SHOULD I EXPLAIN IT MORE
and i can invite
and still limit
Yeah, I mentiuoned that to my mom
lol
i'll be selective of the friends
She was still trying to comprehend the checkbox about whether or not people can invite others
ah
well
I don't think she understood the whole host thing
i can make my own event about the event
lol
nah, I'll explain the host dealio to her again
lol
lol she did it
aight dawg
we good
ok cool
yeah
guests can not invite friends

I think they have a new episode
when does kronovovovovovovi stream?
hmm lemme check
usually a bit later though
and he has class on weekdays so sometimes not at all
yeah he's not on
he should skip his classes
so he can entertain me
lol
watch kyleMasc
he's the guy that made the game winning goal to beat kro's team in a tournament the only time ever
so i wanted wings today
wings sound amazing
I didn't bring lunch with me specifically because we get wings on mondays
and what do we do? decide not to get wings
that's unheard of for a monday
lol
get wings anyway
ay yo andrew
andrew yo ay

wassap
origin8 will be at the career fair wednesday
if you wanna go

kronovi's team got #wrekt'd
by untethered?
uhh
by the other team
just now
in a 4v4
oh
lol
4v4 is not their thing
i think hes playing with subs
he's probably doing sub games yeah
if it's him and sad then it def is
sad is on
they were gonna do them a bunch until ranks get fixed
he thanked someone for sadscribing
and hoped they had a terrible day
lol
yeah
poor sadsubs
they always have terrible days
lol
wow
kronovi self goal
lol
he hates 4's
nearly self goal'd again just now
oh he's drift onlying
that would explain his slidyness
lol
yeah
cohn jena
lol yeah
you should play with kronovi
i'd have to be in the cam fam or a sadscriber
but for just five dollars you could meet the man himself!
lol
for just five dollars I could have delicious food from lots of places
you can get a pound of chicken wings from albertsons for just $5
that sounds delicious
we ended up going to albertsons for lunch
lol
yummy
iridium OP
lol
cohn jena Op
he killed kronovi
that's hard to do normally
lol
he killed a gimped kronovi
some people are into that
lol
the word is taco!
TACO
lollol
wow
lolol
that shoulda been me
so I could disappoint him!
shoulda been you for sure
i bet kronovi likes tacos
you should date
lol
gg
damn kronovi is a legend
i didnt even know it went that high
it seems like a web service that lets streamers coordinate matches with their viewers would be useful
do you know if anything exists like that already?
I don't think so
that would be nice
Yeah
idk how you'd make it scalable for multiple games though
well, joining any steam game via ip/pass is easy
it'd be similar to the streamer giveaway stuff that exists already if it's just a choice of subscribers
but making a server or somehow getting server info isnt as easy
yeah
you could just leave it up to the streamer to supply server ip and password
true
you could have people log in via steam, then join a streamer's queue
which could then be set to act like an actual queue or just choose at random
or hand picked
if it worked for all of the major streaming games, it could potentially make a lot of money
via ads or premium membership or something
yeah, that would be pretty nice probably
although if your only userbase was the streamer themself, it'd be less effective adwise
well all of the viewers that want to play would also be visiting the site
gotcha
well then yeah
that'd be lucrative
I imagine it would at least pay for the cost to operate it, and then generate at least a little bit of income
idk a whole lot about the streaming scene
what do you need to know?
do streamers play with their viewers often? And do they in other games like cs:go or starcraft?
yes, to an extent, but the games are fairly limited
so cs:go yes
starcraft no
depends on how competetive the player is as well
because this wouldnt make sense for anyone other than streamers really
normal players would just do it via friend list
and if there isn't enough traffic then it won't really be worth it
yeah, but streamers would probably find it really useful that there's a way to provide some abstraction between their account and their viewers
yeah
It would make sense for Lol, CS:GO, Dota, and RL. Maybe hearthstone idk how it works. Other games that have long-lasting servers don't really match the use-case
hearthstone requires friends for games
league wouldnt have steam integration
hmm indeed
league is a huge part of the streaming community
yeah
cs:go and dota are fairly large too though
still might make a profit
your server usage would be fairly low for something like this
yeah
LoL has an API to get the current game a summoner is in
i dont think it has any way to get a lobby ip or something
yeah setting up lobbies in LoL was complicated if you remember how we had to do it
weird at least
yaaaassssssss
yoooosssss
still at work?
yeah
go home
its monday
you're monday
"Hi monday, I'm dad"
go home dad
you're drunk
lol
so
i am tired
and still bored
me3
i had canes
and now I need to relieve my bowels
i had albertsons chiquen
it always happens when i have canes
i did that 30 minutes ago
idk why
it was exactly 4:20 when i relieved my bowels
lol
I got 420 points in rocket league like three out of five matches today
#blazeit
so
yoloswaggins
i bought epica tickets
and then i noticed
they cancelled the next 4 shows
because the lead singer's dad is apparently fighting for his life
so she flew back
and the rest of the tour might also get cancelled
is he a gladiator or something?
yeah
nice
lol
their last north america tour also got cancelled
they probably just dont like NA
lol
they did a few canada shows before she flew back to the netherlands
sounds epic
*\_(o,o)_/*
that is my too lazy to google shrug emote

looks angry
well
more perturbed than angry
like kronovi when his roommate taps him on the shoulder and makes him miss the save
lol
man
i need to get gassssss on my way home
sad actually looks sad
it's kinda funny
i havent seen him
does he look like
he's on with facecam right now
yeah
he kinda does
he's got those deep in thought eyes and the slightly emo demeanor
yeah it's the eyes
he has sad keanu eyes
yeah lol
sad keanu looks like sheppard, which makes me want stargate, which makes me sad nao
lol
even his smile makes him look sad
lol
Hello

manga him anyways

Tony how are you at building things? you can lift? you can install doors and toilets and beds?
do you even lift bro
Are you willing to go into canteens where big burly men are beating everything up?
Good! Then I have a prison for you! To build!
Replace my workers they suck.
just let the inmates out
But then how will I make money?
let them be outmates
hmm
you could make money by...
Who will launder my dirty money? who will chop wood for money? who will die to make me money?
creating charming little art things and selling them on Etsy
That seems like a lot of work actually
when I could just have Tony do it.
buy them from an unknown seller on another continent
then resell them at a higher price
People do that?
People deffinetly do that.
do you do that?
Nah man shipping things like that to Canada would cost too much.
Aha!
Tony!
Do you have a mailbox?
why pay tony when you can pay someone in a third world country extremely unfair wages?
tony would expect decent wages
I have a conscious Brandini :^)
i have a mailbox
you could pay Mohanda Gopinath like $1/hr
what am i doing
what
and he would be greatful
and work 18hr/day

yeah that stache is like a fuzzball that fell off a ceiling fan

andrew i tried 1v1 ranked
technically that's more than we payed for
oh yeah?
how was that
yeah
it was wonderful
I did super well
i won like every game
i'm not surprised
jk
oh
i did terrible
lol
absolute trash
got wrekt'd
i figured it'd be easy cause you were super low tier
2 out of 3 times
did you do rank?
my rank is 50
yes
well thats better than 0
now my rank is like 30
lol
im pretty sure the 3rd guy let me win
like he didnt even go for the ball
the secret to 1v1 is to be super defensive
just let your opponent make a mistake
GW2 TIME
laaaaa lalala lazagna
does that satisfy you mustache criticizing fools
yes
good
I am glad you like it
oh god it's animated
of course it is animated

lol
i went back on cursors.io and saw someone using my script
how do I know? it was drawing dickbutts on the field
lol
god i remember that
my script has really found its way in to a lot of people's hands
every time i go there I see a few people using it
lol
that's way too cool
github i assume?
nope
i put it on pastebin and linked it to a few people
nice
i think i also linked it on a reddit post
my guess is most people found it via reddit
lawl
a youtube video explaining how to hack cursors.io
lol
it links to my reddit post
the guy sounds like he is 8
at least
sounds like it could be a girl
nah man
little kid
bandicam
lol
I should comment on his video
"how i use skript"
I wonder if he would notice the matching usernames
probably not
he posted that video on my birthday
man 20k views
I should have made a decent quality video
yup
could have easily gotten 50k views
my question is
why dickbutt
because script kiddies that just copy/paste the hack don't deserve any better
but swastikas
LOL
haha
this kid is great
i like him
lol
click. click. --- dangit!
I commented "Glad you like the script. :D" on his video
we'll see if he connects the dots
lol so many down thumbs
i 2 can be skript kiddie
?
35k views of my pastebin
lol
I am going to edit your script
To do only 1 thing
I'll edit it to be better than your edit
differently
I'll do everything differently!
full GUI!
Do it then
or
only if you one-up what currently exists
find a way to hack agar.io
otherwise I feel no incentive
agar.io isnt nearly as hackable
already tried
I know
lol
My one up was only going to be a swastika
instead
of dickbutt
i can let you zoom in/out and thats about it
welp
the image encoding looks like
var imgData = [ [17,49,17,57],
[18,44,18,52],

ish
I know
so have fun with that
I said was
I looked at the script
and just went
nope
I have a program that automatically generates that encoding for me
lol
whats it called?
or did you write it
it is called
imageParser.html
and I wrote it
exciting name
I know
I'll just change the image scale to 4 or something
call it a day
lol
that isnt even a change
that is just a tweak
I'd put it in the change log
thats like taking a car
and turning a screw or bolt or something
and saying you made a car
nope
Its like taking a car
and pushing the gas pedal
And taking off the rear view mirror
and saying you made the car
and putting on a bigger one
not even
because that is adding a bigger mirror
but I already supply the metaphorical bigger mirror
in my script
thats how I feel whenever I tell people I wrote that hack
lol
having a non-dickbutt helps to convince people
!!!!
!!!!?
someone copied my hack and made a new pastebin
i wonder what they changed
lol
It wasn't me
it still draws dickbutt
priorities
lol
It just downloads a virus
literally all they did was remove the instructions at the top of the file
lol
that one has another 7k views
Make one that draws Javert
someone made a different hack
it draws differently than mine
but the comment is asking about dickbutt
lol
what a legacy to leave behind
a bunch of unwilling dickbutts
Javert
1 sec
Javert your eyes
loooooool
lol
fucking lol
oh
I see
that guy who modified it to make pokemon was using my code
he just encoded the images rotate 90 degrees
not as good as Javert
javert your eyes!
May I light you cigarette sir?
Non!
a lot of french people are using my hax
i wonder why
Why! WHY! Must you Javert your eyes?!
May I light your cigarette sir?
Forsake that meme whatever it is.
I made it
Sir
it needs an image to go along with it
oh i have quite a few
correct
not of me
We need a french person
incorrect
u speek french
no i don't
you showed us
when you read the instructions
I didn't read anything in french
no french speake
remember tent condensation is natural
I didn't know that
I need a snowcone machine in my life
I own one
is it good?
Its old
lol
and hand cranked
lol
and you run out of syrup a lot
but other than that
you get the product you want
"does this come with shaved ice"
question on amazon
I could have a shaved ice machine for just $50
electric or hand crank?
electric
not bad
you'd need to buy or make syrup
it comes with 3 16oz syrup things
or i can get just the machine for $30
ah
that is the cheapest one though
and I imagine it wouldnt last as long as the ~$100 ones
I could get a heavy duty 440lb/h snow cone maker for $150
wow
yeah sno-cone/shave ice machines are horrible until you hit metal parts inside and out
a lot of the 50 dollar ones are plastic as shit
the heavy duty one is full steel
that sounds like it'd be good enough
Might as well open a stand with that one
lol
or
I could just single handedly consume an entire stand worth myself
I think when I eventually get my own house I will be getting that snow cone maker
and I will celebrate with copious amounts of snow cones
then I will proceed to use it about 3 times a year after that
sounds about right
hey thats the  one they have at the graeagle outpost, one of the coffee shop/snack bar places that they have up where my family goes for the summer
have you had a snow cone from it?
nope
but they looked good
yeah
have you seen a snow cone from it?
would you say the resulting ice is more like a super fine powder or more of a crushed texture?
it was pretty fine, but not as fine as the ones that I had in hawaii
ok
I dont like super fine snow cones
i like them to get all crusty and crunchy
lol
perhaps crusty isnt the best word
so you want a snack bar sno-cone
yes
not a shave ice
i dont like those hawaiian shaved-ice places
you heratic
the ratios are all off
too much syrup to ice
the one I had was ice cream covered with shave ice, with syrup on top
and no satisfying crunches
it was amazing
that just sounds like an upset stomach
it was heaven
I'm not lactose intolerant
so it was nice
lol
i am
which is why i want a snow cone
no lactose
damn
now I want a snow cone
like, right now
lol
daaaamn
i do need the book for software engineering
there is a little place outside of a gas station not far from here that sells them

All Canadians are weird
sorry
redundancy
lol
yeah
I like kraft dinner
Its a fact
also anyone who would vote NDP is a commie

NDP isn't socialist.
lol im pretty sure we have the exact same thing in the americas
kraft isnt that krafty
Tony are you gonna come shooting?

Hi
dont forget the bomb!
to be honest his clock didnt look anything like a clock
although I've taken stuff that looked like a bomb through airport security before
probably helped that my name isnt mohamed
lol
strike 1
strike I
strike l
strike |
I mean it really did look very bombish
and if you think about it
timing mechanisms for bombs could be as archaic as that clock
so I really dont get what all the fuss is about
I'm thinking about buying a gun
a new manufactured
gun
ooh yummy
not an old one
what kind?
Marlin Model 1895G
so a new gun that looks old?
only in the sense that its lever-action
yeah
Its fires .45/70 Govt.
i just want an fn five-seven
That's a cool, but unusual gun
its rounds are rare
which is cool
They are fast bullets
that's the point
but yeah
hard to get rounds in the us
just gotta move to belgium
ezpz
lol getting a gun lisence there would cost your soul
join the police force
ezpz
The Marlin I want takes a round designed to kill buffalos :D
so you could say with that gun you're an anti-buffalo soldier
yes
There are special bear killing rounds for it too
those might be useful
I feel like normally bullets just make bears want to hit you harder
Yeah, most rounds I would say that's what happens
so you need a nice big anti-soft tissue round
so something explosive
nah
not that intense
I bet 8mm Mauser and anything larger would work
the concusion would likely kill it
well you'd have to hit near something vital
which for large bodies is tough without high velocity penetration through bone
lungs man
and 8mm Mauser was used on rinos
so I image it would work on bears
well that would be hunting
i was talking about survival
lungs would take a few seconds to take effect
use 2 rounds
so in self defence it'd be fairly ineffective
Maybe as 8mm
but the .45/70 gov is ~11mm
lol
that's tiny :P
and comes as a hollowpoint bear round
"tiny"
that's only like what, half an inch?
.50 cal is 12.7mm
yeah
.50 cals kill elephants with a single round
teeny tiny
elephants are afraid of mice
mice are tiny
thus the bullets are tiny
Lemme just go order a 40mm Bofors for self defense then
that's a much better idea
Let me find the unit cost on that
just buy a tank
wow
Now that I think of it, .50 cal's at high velocity turn people's heads to a fine red mist
Bofors 40mm has been in continuous production since 1930
so that'd be effective on lots of things
40mm Bofors is only $18,500!
pshh that's cheap!
so affordable!
it's basically free
By government standards yes
.45/70 works with black powder or smokeless
that gun looks old
it has lever action AND wood!
yo dog we in mumble if you wanna join
that back is looking smexy
tech support question
I watch stuff on Streamlord and it seems to eat memory on my C drive when I do.
nvm solved
empty recycle bin
derp
lol
every time
sheesh
what is up folks
we is in mumble
doin wat
racket league
kay
no
lol
Its advertising to me, mak it stahp
lol
at least they're good movie moments
lel
the best part is we can fulfill tony's daily loving of minions
yes
my thoughts exactly
thats tony right now
i need soup or glue
nao
nao
just to confirm you're still going to concert yis?
minus epica?
yes
imma play an amnesia custom story
to help me sleep
lol
apparently amnesia comes with a collection of short stories
~40 pages long
oh wow
sheesh
such adrenaline
it's scary playing amnesia and not knowing when things are gonna happen
man etho really lost his UHC edge
sup
hi
Hows work
its aight
i just had lunch
Same
except I got to go home after
chiquen and a banana/oats/peanut butter/honey wrap
with an arizona green tea
KETCHUP CHIPS WERE ON SALE
SALE SALE SALE!!!!
but not the all dressed
gonna make all of you fat (music)
Im not Asian...
or are you
I KNEW IT!
Dunno
could be asian
it would be nice if the linux skype client didnt suck
snappihng turtles are no joke
hi
this game tho
is literally impossible
kurt does it once
WHAT
I LANDED AND IT BLEW UP AFTER @ SECONDS
lol
gg
nailed it
wanna do some rocket league?
DO I?!?!?
idk
yeah sure
Brandon Worl
Brandon Worl
space engineers is looking really good
sick
Perhaps we should play again
Wait planets are a thing
now
we definitely should, when planets come out
they arent out yet
oh I c
if only there were a way to port like blueprints into multiplayer
what do you mean?
like in survival multiplayer
to load a frame
of a ship
to build say
6 of the same fighter
or something
I thought there was
not that I knew of
Pretty sure that's been in the game for months now
Haven't played in ages
lol
same
I'm like 90% sure they added blueprints
We'll have to find out
i googled it
they added it
lol
wooot
so can we factory build robo-fighters of death
maybe
like little flying pyramids
to defend the base
people had old conveyor belt builder things
im not sure if auto building has progressed past that
it only worked for super small things
oh lame
whats the point of the future if you don't have robot building robot building robots?
when you said future, all I could think about was http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/core/futures.html
When do you plan to file FMLA for mental health?
nev3r
Do you just think scala all day now
well
i have thought about this code im working on for most of the day
i fixed a huge security flaw today
How huge?
any authenticated user could send messages, as any other user
For Angie's list?
so if I was logged in, I could send you a message posing as any service provider or other member
yeah
not for the live version
hmmmm
for the new in development version
I see
darn
lol
but yeah
it was kinda a crappy fix
Not that I would have abused such a thing
involving duplicated code
and there are a few ways to fix it
a slightly less crappy way, or a really nice way
Remove mailing
the really nice way involves HUGE refactoring
so
im likely going to be redoing a ton of the support objects around messaging for the next few days
thus I have been considering this in my head
however
I cant do that until this stupid build passes on CCI
and it has failed like 4 times
y so fail
flaky tests, other issues
it looks like it will pass this time though
been running for an hour and nine minutes
try and break it
do it
break it
no
boo
way to go brandog, pick the easy way out :P
wat
your wimpy fix
vs the awesome fix
hay man I said I'm gonna do the awesome fix
but it takes a lot of refactoring
i know that feel
so i did the quick fix so it can get through testing
I felt very accomplished today, in AI we started working with crazy linear algebra in code and I got it to work first try
I once broke something and made it look fixed
linear algebra is nice
it is
i'm glad i remember a lot of it
linear algebra is one of the few math classes I actually enjoyed
I wish it wasn't quite so easy not to go to class with sotoko though, I would have enjoyed it more probably
it was just so boring sometimes in lecture
i usually went
almost never paid attention
see when I went I was catching up, so I actually payed attention
i just read my ebook usually
I went like 1/2 classes per week
i just learned it all through the homework
in the beginning I did the hw in class while we learned about it
it was nice
then it got hard
and long
most of the stuff just made sense to me though
and she said it
like, I didnt do the HW yet and we had a quiz, so I just did what seemed legit
and got A's
lol
lol
that worked about 2/3 of the time
not bad
the other 1/3 I failed miserably
I think i did that once or twice too
GOD
DAMN
IT
it failed again
failed
lame
lol
poor brandog
why does stuff randomly fail?
like
different failure this time
that makes little sense to me
because
is their testing software just that bad?
no
it basically takes the code and does everything from scratch
so
it builds the whole environment
if npm fails to install something, that will make it fail
or
if an endpoint takes too long to run for whatever reason, it will fail
there's a lot of moving parts
gotcha
that makes much more sense
of course, if their CCI stuff was set up better, I doubt it would randomly fail
but yeah
it compiles the build 3 times in parallel
so far I've had 2/3 fail every attempt
but I need all 3 to pass to merge it to the sprint branch
and other than their build problems there's nothing you can do to fix the failures?
well I could remove all the tests
lol
or I can sit here and press the rebuild button every hour till it passes
and i'm guessing one of those is the course you SHOULD take, and the other isn't really an option
yes
lol
poor guy
CCI also says "Partially degraded service - components affected: AWS"
i wonder if that is why it keeps failing
as in you're using outdated methods from an updated software package?
no
as in something is wrong between CCI and AWS
it just says there is degraded performance
oh i'm thinking depreciated
not degraded
sup doges
hi doge
i only have 6 more days of AL :D
woo
did you do your major refactor yet?
working on it
nice
it's a huge multi-day thing
gotcha
wooo i completed one section of my refactoring
and the code still works
lol
nice
I now have a movable car
using accelerometer
in Unity?
but i'm thinking i'm probably gonna restart what I have
yeah
i'm using their prefabs, which is kinda cheaty in the first place, but modifying them to do what I want is going to be more of a pain than just writing it myself
there's a ton of functionality that I dont want
refactoring! isnt it fun
(it kinda is)
lol
it is
especially the feeling you get after you're done and you see that the new solution is wayyyy better than the original
yeah
ye
yea weekend
brandoge home already?
no
i am still at the office refactoring
ah
go home
the old code used strings for the observer type
like
Oh
so i had my most awesome goal ever today
"Member" or "ServiceProvider"
which is bad
so now I am making it use EntityType.Member and EntityType.ServiceProvider
which means I have hundreds of errors now
Trains Simulator  dawg
which is bad but only in the short term!
come on get trains simulator 3000
lol
that way it's at least in space and has space pirates
I actually know what you meant by the observer
turns out design patterns is a useful class
what is the definition of observer in design patterns?
will never actually buy Train Simulator though
lol
in this case observer is just a class name for an api
Its basically DLC Simulator
oh gotcha
well the observer pattern is a pair of classes, one of which is observable, one of which is an observer
think of it like twitter, where the observer can read tweets, and the observable is the tweet posting object
so a user can have one of each
yeah, that isnt quite the same
gotcha
this is an incredibly over-engineered message handler
lol
that's basically what the observer pattern does
message sending/recieving
yeah
there isnt really an observable here though
there probably is but it is burried under a mountain of over-engineered junk
lol
it's probably the thing I said about a user having both observable and observer composition
so it's hidden and the messages just get passed
i guess the decorators interact with the "observables"
ayyyy decorators
I know those too
lol
we wrote a christmas tree store
and decorated the trees
as you can imagine, entity type is used all over the place
and every time I update the things my console complained about, it gets 1 step farther and finds an even bigger list of broken stuff
i love when that happens
the stupid thing is, I am doing all of this so that I can implement one class more cleanly
well, also because it bothers me how jumbled the code is
OOH!
i think it is gonna finish compiling
nope
false alarm
lol
it finally compiled and it even still works!
Hello Tony.
How are you on this fine evening, Tony?
Doing well I hope, Tony?
well that's a good place to stop. Time to head homeeeeee
Ohai
yeah i don't pay attention lol sorry
text if urgent
urgent to the max
uber
ergent
I have been told I need to try and find the poutine lays and bring them to you guys
ive never even had the poutine lays yet
i want to try real poutine
kfc has poutine
in america?
uhh
you guys
don't have poutine?
normally?
not really
there's poutine everywhere here
not even a new York fries?
wat
New York Fries?
what are NY fries?
they don't have poutine either?
wat
it looks like at some locations you can ask for poutine at KFC, and they will make it if they have the ingredients
never heard of them before
the kfc poutine is ok
they don't use the right cheese though
and the gravy is a bit too salty
but it'll give you the gist of it
o.o
i dont want to sound/look stupid going to a USA KFC and asking for poutine, then they are like "wat is pooteen"
lol ill go with you !
and then im like "the internet said it is on the secret menu"
I don't mind asking for a poutine
and they are like "we dont have a secret menu"
and then i am like "well your face is a pooteen"
and i walk backwards out of the KFC
never to return again
lol
You can get poutine everywhere here
at my university campus, there is a poutine only shop in the cafeteria
they only sell poutine
can I get it from like an auto parts shop?
well no
I guess not
so you cant get it everywhere
Brandini you can get it almost everywhere
I assure you
And I don't mind asking for poutine for you
even if I have to explain that they need to add cheese curds and gravy like a barbarian.
there is a place near-ish to me that sells "grilled multigrain breakfast poutine"
...wat....?
so like?
poutine...in multigrain bread?....and grilled?
idk
that sounds disgusting.
apparently Cafe Vettro in the Aria has poutine
damn it's expensive
three eggs with bacon, sausage, or ham + hash browns ins almost 17 dollars
you could get more food for far less at dennys
maybe denny's will make you poutine
a poutinerie is gonna open near Container Park
bleh
it's a company from Ontario
bleh to poutine and container park
Ian says bleh to fun!
Container park is in the ghetto
Ian just needs to wait for his scotch mints
container park may be in the ghetto, but the ghetto isnt in container park
Dammit Brandon.
Now I want poutine
me too
This is your fault
it is
TIL
New York fries only exists in Canada, Korea, Australia and the United Arab Emirates.
go figure.
not even new york
lol wow
No not even
But it is also in China
My favourite fries
and you guys don't even have them
we just appropriated the name.
lol
i want to find a canadian restaurant here and have new york fries in the middle of california/reno
but new york fries is the name of te place
oh
i thought it was a dish
well maybe they serve new york fries and new york fries
idk
lol
oh you're home now huh
yes
an I am STARVING
hi starving i'm dad
california seasoning on new york fries
i cant look at this menu
I am too hungry
eat food then
holy bacon double cheese poutin
like wow
its really good.
the size shown on the website it the large
you can get an x-small, which is just like a little cup
and makes it less bad xD
there's no such thing as less bad if there's bacon involved
bacon makes everything 100% perfect
and no size difference will change that
lololol
Courtney Boyle
Ian
Brandon Worl
Thomas Moore
brandog
come play rocket league
you too tony
yoyoyo
1 sec
I might not be able to bring all of the chips that I originally intended.
just bring your hurdy gurdy instead
wat
Courtney Boyle
Ian
Brandon Worl
Thomas Moore
the original hurdy gurdy master
fuck the what
this is not good
lol
this is good
yes
is ian a fast or a slow hiker?
uhh
May I light your cigarette sir?
idk
he hikes at an appropriate pace
but...
appropriate for whom...
hikers
a freaking violin stick with a hurdy gurdy
what a versatile instrument
hurdy gurdy cover of the band imma see
is this obscure instrument day?
the hurdy gurdy is amazing
i want one
$1000
that is a box
it has to look nice
scroll
ah
thats cheaper than the other ones i found
the kit is only $600
What are you waiting for?
i dont want to spend 40 hours building it for "fairly unrefined sound"
Buy a steel drum then
way cooler
and cheeper
nothing is cooler than a hurdy gurdy
hurdy derpy
it is the most metal instrument EVER!
Buy a concertina?
why would I do that
To have one
I'd rather have a hurdy gurdy
buy a peddle-guitar
nein!
Buy a cannon
nein!
why not?
it isnt a hurdy gurdy
Cannons are better
I'd think you would like the hurdy gurdy
it has a funny name and is old
Not really
Its got a whiny sound
and it is obscure
that totally seems like your thing
I like the Saxophone
which is none of those things
ghey
Bill Clinton plays sax
ghey
He got all the ladies
Hurdy Guigui plays the hurdy gurdy
Your mom plays the Facebook
she does
Also if I were to buy a string instument
It'd be a mandolin
or a cello
we should make a band with a mandolin, a cello, a hurdy gurdy, and a vocalist
i nominate tony for vocalist
he'll just say "squeedle dee dul dee"
lol
so, at our developer lunch today, we were discussing what talk we wanted to watch
one guy suggested a talk given by this person who always includes ponies in her examples
lol
then we got in a huge debate about why that is weird
haha
and why we cant watch it
i'd watch it
it ended 30 minutes later in the guy who suggested it storming out of the conference room
and we didnt watch any talks
lol
poor guy
he just wanted to see ponies
lol
weird/10
ur mums a pony
j/k
she's an ol' grey mare
rude
well you're a fedora
so there
Oh yeah?
m'ian
lol
m'self
I only occasionally wear hats
am the rest of my attire is appropriate
yeah, if the occassion is casual or formal
I own formal and casual hats too
m'lady, can I offer you some of:
arcane alchemists have some good grinding music
like
I could grind out tons of enderman kills back in the OG doc's end farm
lol
end ur man
is there any way of getting stuff off of soundcloud into like mp3 form?
yassss
I really want intrusion for my game's soundtrack
you could record it with audacity
idk if theres a better way
there are probably websites that can rip it like those youtube download things
oh
there is a download button
lol
according to google at leasttttt
not all tracks are downloadableeee
yeah it's not one of them
i'm trying a ripper now
sweet
seems like good quality too
I now have an mp3 of intrusion
inb4 copyright
well yeah
it's not like i'm selling it
it's for a school project
i went to the buy page for their album
it is in french
idk wat
yeah
lol
"Pays France"
"Nom"
Nom?
NOMNOMNOM
Quoi?
I no speak french
OMNOMONOM
NON NON NON
french is weird
the french are weird
truth
these songs are gonna be really cool for my game
hurdy gurdy!!!11!
your game should be hurdy gurdy themed
lol
so i had a question
cause you've worked a little with unity for sushil right?
a little
i put lights on boats
making boats
yeah
lol
ok
lol
so I was trying to figure out how I would do the terrain
cause if I make big ol meshes and add them to the game procedurallyish (randomly select from possible tiles and place it in front of the player) I feel like that'd make the game huge
I'm sure unity has built in terrain stuff
it has planes
unity has like all the plugins ever
but I need custom terrain for car platforming ish stuff
just find a terrain plugin
plugins are so hard to integrate though
so many things
that I dont need
this song is great
you'll get a better product in the end if you just use an existing terrain generator
probably
but then I wont have made it myself
and I wont be able to say I made a unity game from scratch
its not worth it, just use a terrain generator
lol
:F
and a physics engine while you're at it
ill begin my search
unity's physics work just fine
do you know what engine it uses?
Bullet?
no clue
well
if you're using its physics anyways, then it isnt from scratch :p
well yeah
but everything else would be
that's why it'd be a unity game from scratch
my suggestion is use existing stuff to make your life easier, so you can focus on making the gameplay good
the problem i'm having right now is getting the physics how I want them
I need the car to jump and do side-roll-jump thingies like in rocket league
make a minecraft clone with Voxeland
getting the car to stay upright is tough
lol
they have a song called the race
lol
hi

I woke up at 8 today
it's saturday
that made me sad
i woke up at 11 today
lucky you
I didnt even get my morning coffee
i also did not have coffee
but thats normal for you
i need my coffee
do you need it with you at all time?
I love mah cream, I love mah sugar, gotta have it in my coffee at all time!
I drink my coffee black
Tony takes 3 creams and 4 sugars
I drink mine with sugar
no cream
Brandon doesn't drink it
lol
yerp
actually at homke
when not surviving
Milk and cream, no sugar
lol
I think we should play some RL
RL is gay
says the guy that hasnt tried it
Don't like soccer
or sports games
or cars
it's not soccer
or fun
it's cars
with rockets
unless there's a train in the distance
Its cars with rockets
playing soccer
no, it's cars with rockets hitting a giant ball at around 100mph into a goal, sometimes while flying through the air
ball into goal is soccer
there's really very little in common with RL and soccer
except the fact that there is a ball and a goal
Is the objective to move a ball into a goal?
That's soccer
basketball does this as well
That's hand soccer
football is moving a ball into a goal zone
Fat soccer
you a hater breh
u just hate us cuz you anus
no its because sports games are dull
nah
they're fast paced
and fun
The only point is to move a ball into a goal
what is the point of trains
Its the same reason I don't like FPS games
that is the end goal yes
there are many other subgoals
the point of a train is to move the people in to the goal station
maybe not even people
possibly balls
possibly lots of balls
The train games I play are generally about making money
and are open ended
there is no "winning"
so moving the dollars in to the goal bank account
the "winning" is getting to the point where there's nothing else to do
There is always something to do
Its like sim city
No such thing as a perfect city
there are limits to every game
ian don't like fun
^
I like complexity
there is plenty of complexity in manipulating a controller using fast twitch muscle fiber and quick thinking in order to move a rocket powered car towards a ball in such a way that the ball moves towards and into a goal past up to four opponents
Doesn't seem that complex to me
it is more complex than you think
it is
tru
playing an instrument doesnt seem as complex on the surface as it actually is
^
RL is the same way
RL is just soccer thru a different means
RL is basically a hurdy gurdy
Hurdy gurdy is a bad example for your point
Its easier to play than a piano
then an instrument is just making noise through different means
and your moneymaking games are just making 1's and 0's move in a pattern
idk, hurdy gurdy has a lot more going on at once than a piano
Its a crank on a violin with buttons
you have to control 3 sets of strings though
9 strings total
while cranking and pushing buttons
a piano is just pushing buttons
Right, but you can be expected to operate 10 of them at the same time
technically there are many more possibilities for notes and combinations of notes through a hurdy gurdy than a piano
you can tune a hurdy gurdy
you cant tune a piano
yeah a piano cant even be perfectly tuned
You can tune a piano
you can also tune a fish
Point is I enjoy Rocket League.
pianos are impossible to perfectly tune
^
me3
and brandon is correct
My point is its a twitch based game and I dislike those
our point is you're wrong! you dont know what is good for you!
YEAH
OPINIONS ARE LIKE, YOUR OPINION MAN
AND THEY ARE WRONG
SURE
WHAT HE SAID
so back to reality, whoops there goes gravity
mom's spaghetti
RL guys?
maybe
i have to go run some errands though
idk if that is now or later
the words you're looking for are "yes" and "sir"
but i just showered
and my hair is damp
that's the perfect time to play RL
and if i wear a headset now it will be stoopid hair later
just wear a hat
i dont wear hats
unless i am planning on fishing
wear an old asian dude mask
did you seriously wear a hat when you went fishing?
i dont want to enter a store like that
i will get shot
yes
I want to see this
lol
I feel like you with a hat is weird
it is

I am back
from the gun show
I have those turned off
king kong has some guns
what
why? they are fun!
FUN!
sure they are
I bought a uhhh
"new"
gun
an old gun?
a new old gun?
well
Define old
90s or earlier
wow you have a weird sense of old
i guess 90s isnt that old for a gun
80s or older
lol
well
its
uhhh
that is old as balls
Its in arma though!
still old as balls
Its a good gun :(
what is it?
Lee Enfield Mk IV
it's at least a nice looking old gun
i should go work on my costumeeee
do eet?
i bought pizza
it will be here in 40 minutes
woot
toow
pizza hut pizza, is the pizza, for you and me
turns out there is a pizza hut that delivers here brandon
and they have breadsticks
also, kuxir is probably my pick for best rocket league player now
not kronovi
skill wise
pizza was a success
So
Your chips
Are going to be somewhat crushed
It just cant be helped.
Do we know yet if I will see both Tony and Brandini at the same time? :P
noice
looks weird with a t-shirt underneath lol
very cool tho
yeah, imma have a body suit under it
you have to make a video of you saying "I'm commander Brandon Shepard, and this suit is the best one on the citadel!"
so apparently it's a known bug with RL that if you alt-tab you can possibly have your controller unregister itself with the game and require either a restart of the game or replug of the controller
sadjunior has that problem
and kro apparently
and me apparently
indeed
so
moral of the story: don't alt+tab
doral of the mtory: ton't alt+dab
lol
so
so
RL?
indeed
quite
indubitably

i feel like playing SC Blacklist MP again
i wonder if it is still dead
almost definitely
I miss that game
yeah
when it was populated
it was fun
very
we were good too
had them OP strats
the teamwork part was the best
yeah
did you hear about gibbs and how he was in jail a bit ago?
no
what he did
apparently he was driving and he smacked a horse on the ass on his way past (police horse) so they gave him an hour in jail
wat
lol
that's what kro and sad said
and they sounded serious
who the hell does that
right?
who smacks a horse on the ass
in a car, no less
apparently gibbs does
lol
she doesnt even realize she hit that goal
lol
jeeze
she keeps getting incredibly lucky goals
lol
aerial goal
with one hand off the controller
lol wow
lolol someone made a logo for kro and the team, it's a dude with a bat standing over a dead horse with the title "cosmic afterhorse"
lol
gonna take alex to work at 430, wanna play some chivalry when I get back?
yass
yees
unless i go to the movies
this networking hw
it seems easy
is wireshark ezpz?
easy enough. does he still require a screenshot of where you found every answer?
yep
because that is a PITA
i'm just gonna take one screenshot and paint [#1] with an arrow to the info
that way it's only three pics
thats what I did
the program we have to write is really pretty trivial
you could just do the math and answer
is it like packet routing or something?
just counting how often 35 users at 40% active make packets for 1000 seconds/cycles, how many are dropped if only 18 are allowed, stuff like that
we have to make a histogram of the data though
i'll just use python
matplotlib makes histograms easy
imma go to the movie at 6ish
we could do a bit of chivalry though
what movie are you seeing?
mission: improbable - rogue nation
ooh
i want to see that still
lemme know if it's good
i will give you a massive spoiler
tom cruise is ethan hawke?
wow, thanks :D
np
I've always wanted a massive spoiler
i like how you can see the regular car under all that
when does it get here?
near the wheel/door
it is digital
oh
its alreay there
pshh
alreay
yee

ohai
HELLO
hello
so Eluveitie increased their setlist from 19 songs to 26 songs
pretty impressive song count
go folks
wat
did you see the 2 new armor progress pics i linked last night tony?
no]
that's coming along great dude
tanks
I added a seam under the right arm so I can actually get in/out of it
with some rare earth magnets to hold it shut
unfortunately they arent quite strong enough
looking good brosef
how far along are you like when did you start
uhh
i'll see when my first progress shot is dated
9/5 is first progress shot, which was like 2 days worth of work
not bad
mostly just been working on weekends
next is the cod/butt pieces, then shoulders
and then arms/legs and it'll be done
except for paint
legs are always weird
paint might not make the halloween deadline
but the color of the foam is good enough as is
the legs are pretty simple
compared to the torso armor
so I think they should be quick
just go for where the lights are or something
?
paint
color
or pop in glow sticks where the LED stuff is
there will be actual lights where lights are needed
oooh
ideally controlled by a raspberry pi and sequenced
sick
yay, christmas light show in suit form!
the weird thing is, that torso armor fits me, but not my plaster body cast
which should only be slightly bigger than me
...hm
well that makes sense because the armor probably shrinks a bit after setting
wat
afk for a minute
gnite
night
NOTICE ME SENPAI, NOTICE MEEEEE
hi
hi
sup
nmy
nmu
want to play some game
wat gem
any gem
gotta get alex at 11 so it's gotta be fairly short gem
a round or 4 of RL?
ehhhhhh i guess
:F
Brandon Worl
Ian
wow
Wow!
Noooo!
Brandon Worl
Ian
hi
soma comes out at midnight tonight
woo
too bad i will have to wait till tomorow to play it anyways
i wonder if I can download it early using an east coast vpn or something
mebbeh
hebbem
olleh

kuxir is playing SARPBC right now on twitch
kinda cool to see the history
man i used to be a pro at SARPBC
that was interesting
pretty sure he could have shot it down with the plane though
wat
that is crazy talk
oh sorry
that seems totally normal ezpz to kill a heli with c4 from your plane
yeah
what a noob
he didnt even 360 it
lol
dafuq
why is it so slow
if you're near the ball in this mode it slomos you
thats kinda cool
nice
is this replay or game mode
training by the looks of it
it's the single player modules
foooor...?
he's playing through and unlocking all thecars
for SARPBC
ohhhh
Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle Cars yo
so, it apparently is indeed possible to install steam games early using a vpn
but it's also bannable isnt it?
idk
who says i didnt just fly to australia for an hour or two
moi
right
this map is awesome
you can go through the goal to get to the other side quickly
gw2 time
welp, turns out you cant trick steam with a vpn
welp
i got 70% on all-star goalie training
i am getting slightly better
holy crap
RL on three screens is absolutely sickening
I instantly want to throw up, the moment I start turning
XD
lol
turning motion blur back on helped
watching kuxir play sarpbc made me feel that way, the camera was so shaky
a little bit, at least
a lot a bit
imma try playing an unranked match like this
i've been writing python code to generate a histogram of simulated packet generation for networking for like the past two hours
on the plus side i'm learning how to use matplotlib
sounds like you need a break
yep
I am ranked Silver
almost done though
I think
welp
we won
and i didnt do bad
i have no depth perception
this is like Sushil's ultimate wet dream http://imgur.com/SFqBgvH
nice
richard is working on stuff like that with nasa
nice
that video was CG according to the comments
not suprising considering I dont see any sort of tracking equipment near the drones
yeah
that makes sense
that stuff's not easy to do lol
also I just want to say that the bad guy in mission improbable sounded like an absolute retard
lol
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ167890!@#$%^&*()-_=+[{]}\|;:'",<.>/?
there's a $1400 Herman Miller Embody on craigslist for $100
i reallly hope nobody has bought it yet
that chair is basically the god of all office chairs
imma thieve it
nahman
its mine!
namhan
i honestly think they just forgot a 0 in the price listing
but maybe they found the chair and have no clue how much it is worth
that would be nice
but google exists
it was posted yesterday, so hopefully it really is $100 and still for sale
that would be nice
damn that chair is sexy
yeah it is
the one for sale has a chrome base and black everything else
not my ideal config, but not bad
personally I'd go titanium base, white frame, and black or midnight blue or maybe red fabric
herman miller chairs are also reallllly comfortable
seemed that way
so
i finished my refactoring
how's it look?
it's pretty nice
got rid of a bunch of unused objects
and now there are no magic strings
and user validation isnt a hacky duplicated mess
i cant get any of it code reviewed though
which means tomorrow I am going to get slammed with stuff to change in code review, and I'll have to get it all done before thursday
ouchie
what does code review changes entail? isn't your code like the most beautiful code ever?
there are always things to change from code review
_always_
even when you think there isnt
there is
like what?
I suspect the way I have my observer classes will get some scrutiny
I have an abstract BaseObserver class
then I have GenericObserver, MemberObserver, and ServiceProviderObserver that all extend it
it's structured that way to appease the other code that was built with that design in mind
but that isn't necessarilly the best design
I personally think it is fine though
also he might suggest that I combine some of the decorators, because they have a lot of duplicated code
duplicated code is gross
it isnt like exact duplicate
but it is close
gotcha
just gotta favor composition over inheritance yo
ye
im not even sure what the distinction is between composition and inheritance in scala
well
composition would be a class having a member belonging to the class you'd be inheriting from normally
so
like in sushi's game design?
hmm
yes
I believe so
kinda
it's like with the twitter assignment I told you about
you have an observer, the tweet reader
and you have the observable, the tweeter
and a user is composed of both, rather than inheriting both
so it has a tweet reader and a tweeter member instead of inheriting from those classes
yeah
but scala also has stuff
that I'm not sure how it all fits together
like traits vs classes
particularly abastract classes
traits?
apparently if the behavior of it won't be reused, then it should be an abstract class. If it will be reused in multiple unrelated classes, it should be a trait
interesting
among other things
i'm playing hearthstone so imma take a minute to reread that and understand
lol
traits can also act like java interfaces
oh
ok
which are somehow related to composition
that I understand
yes
so you have your class composed of an interface, rather than inheriting from an abstract class
gimme a sec to finish my turn and I'll explain
yeah that explains it pretty well
that seems a lot like inheritance to me though
Person could be changed to abstract class, then "override" added to Student, and it would achieve the same end result
idk if multiple inheritance is allowed though
I know you can extend multiple traits
apparently traits are scala's solution to multiple inheritance
pretty sure java's is interfaces
yeah looks that way
cause you can't inherit from multiple classes
but you can have multiple interfaces
well then, knowing all that
my observers were using composition initially
I changed to inheritance at some point to attempt to fix another issue
it didnt fix it but I never changed back lol
changing it back would probably be better for scalability
but it already is scala!
ba dum psh
ha
haha
hahaha
heh
got it
lol
this is fun
I know things that you don't immediately know
yeah the MemberObserver and SPObserver used to extend BaseObserver with Validation or something like that
but now Validation is its own thing in a util object
interesting
util trait, actually
but it has a weird self type
which is some scala thing I only partially understand
I'd have to see the structure to give some kind of intelligible comment
it has to be structured this way
because of issues with mixins, self types, and inheritance/composition
HAS to be?
I'm sure there are other ways it could be done, but not as part of the observer classes
not cleanly at least
maybe somehow, but it would be worse than what it was trying to clean up
idk mayne
you're probably right
lol
i spent hours trying to make it fit in the observer classes
lol
this is the solution Vlad came up with
and he knows his shizzle
well then it's probably correct
like I said i'd have to see it to make comments
UML is really nice
ugh
it makes things so clear
h8
it's so easy though
h88888
y
aint got time fo dat
it takes less time to do UML beforehand than it does to restructure and refactor your entire codebase
there are models that describe the angies list architecture somewhere
I think I mostly just hate UML in the academic sense
when you are forced to use it for super simple things
for a huge set of applications like AL, it makes sense
but I mean, that's just common sense
yeah
it's natural to diagram a complex system before starting on it
totally
regardless of if you use a standard like UML or not
but doing it yourself is the part that makes everything easy
and if you use a standard like UML then you can get it critiqued so you don't have 40% of your code challenged in a code review
on my senior project, we did super simple modeling
very specifically 40%
and only 40
no more, no less
I wouldn't use UML for something like implementing a ticket like this
most tickets are just "add an endpoint that takes these params and returns this json"
there's really not much to model there
and a ticket should be simple enough that it doesn't require UML to keep it straight
well the back end of a ticket system might be complicated because of the system you're integrating it into
?
are you making a separate system for tickets or are you integrating it with AL?
tickets as in "ticket 1231 says to do this"
it's a project management thing
oh
lol
not what i was imagining
lol
UML should be used before development, not during.
imo
oh yeah
definitely
if you do it during then your perception of the structure is already skewed
for our senior project we drew up our modules and how they related to each other
same for our db tables
btw elite dangerous is 40% off so you should buy it
which gave us enough structure to work on multiple parts at once, knowing exactly how to interface each part
that's really all you need
yeah
agreed
this class should seriously be required
idk why it isnt
I have a resentment for UML from Dascalu I think
its so useful
see, eelke presents it in the most nonchalant way possible so there's no hatred yet
yeah
he gave us an optional lecture on UML
well, one optional and one quick overview
like
"this is uml its easy so yeah"
"Soooo, here we have a UML document, and it's kind of doing this thing so that you can plan the structure of your code beforehand, which we did when i was at google for a summer"
dascalu was like "today we will talk about uml for the next 27 hours"
no dascalu would be like "so... panting UML... for lots hours"
lol
yes
and eelke just sounds like he has a cotton ball stuck behind his tongue
haha
I have a lot of cotton balls
still
lol
idk where they went actually
i have been practicing RL androo
you good now?
idk
lol
lol
can you aerial?
70% all-star goalie training
not bad
did you get them all with the right bumper resets?
practiced a lot of aerials doingthat
right bumper doesnt award points
I know
oh
yes
gooood gooood
let the rage flow through you
if i missed the first I re-did it until I got it 3 times in a row
become one with the dark side
nice
that's actually a good way of doing it
kinda
the surprise of the first try is the best
yeah
I'm up to 60% on all star aerial
fucking difficult
lol
most of them is just getting the ball to land in front of the goal so you can finish it off before time runs out
which i think counts
I want to see kronovi or another top player do the all-star trainings
cause if you put it on track your teammates can hit it for you
they do exactly what I just said
lol
except kuxir
he actually makes everythign
he's insane
lol
hax
and he does crazy spins and stuff in midair beforehand as well
pretty much the entire community recognizes him as the best freestyle aerialist and best wall player
even kro
sometimes he tries too crazy of things though and it bites him in the ass
ooh
lol
have you tried soma yet?
not yet
excite
much excite
i hear it isnt as scary as amnesia, but it has a really good story
but we'll see
that's fine
as long as it isnt as boring as AAMFP
nothing will ever be as scary as amnesia until they remake amnesia
yeah
the real amnesia
not shitty chinese room crap
someone described it as being less jump-scary and more atmospherically scary
shitty crap
amnesia was pretty atmoscary
yeah
this is apparently more
nice
that's really cool
and there are a lot of moral choices you can make
I want to try something like that with oculus or steamvr
yeah
VR horror is probably the only way you can beat Amnesia
definitely
well
you could probably do it with another game with the psychological system of amnesia, with better sounds and graphics
yeah its graphics were kinda outdated
very
monster is like 12 poly
but on the other hand, a lot of newer graphics look too shiny imo
yeah, true
I thought alien looked too shiny to be good horror
the grittyness made it feel better compared to Alien Isolation which was all pretty looking
lol
lol
so the python I wrote for networking last night was really fun
I learned a ton about the libraries we'll be using in AI too
so it was super useful
nice
*indian accent* python is very easy okay
basically just made a packet generating class that takes a number of users, probability of being active, and a number of seconds to run for
and it plots the data in a bunch of useful ways
lol
derka derka
scala is like a weird combination of java and c#
scala is just weird
at least that's how it looks to me
lol
it tries to be like a functional programming language
but not quite
woah
and it has this horrible invention called implicits
new Duck with Quacking
that's awesome
that are literally the devil
I love that syntax
lol
implicits?
yes
they are the devil
(i didnt know you could do new duck with quacking)
im not sure how I feel about that syntax
anyways
it's really cool
implicits are evil
but it's probably bad programming
say you have a function
oh no i meant the syntax
that takes one param of type long
implicits seem like the devil just from the description i'm reading
we'll call the function foo
and you have an object, lets say user
user is of type User
you can do foo(user)
def foo(bar: long) = {}
and it'll work if you have an implicit conversion of User to Long
but from just looking at that code
that seems useful but bad
you'll have no idea how it is converting or even that it is converting at all
exactly
useful but a PITA to read
and super easy to misuse
it's like overriding >> and << or other operators in c++ for a class, except in parameters of functions
they can also be used for other things
but that's all I've used them for
why would you want to use something so hard to read though?
idk
that just seems bad
people tell me there are reasons
like I said, useful but bad
lol
but idk what they are
It basically saves a step or two in conversion
it lets us have cleaner looking code
but unless the compiler gets some kind of performance boost from doing that I'm not sure what the purpose would be
cleaner looking until you read it
and are like "wat how is he do dis"
cleaner but harder to follow
i dont like them, but some people love them
it seems like a quirk that programming language designers put in just so their language has something different
idk enough about their other uses to say
lol
lol
in any case it seems weird
yes
when you heading home?
meow
woo
download/buy elite dangerous and we can play RL while it downloads :D
I finished my homework for the week except for the atari code I need to do in embedded games
and now i'm bored
lol
did you buy the chair
is elite dangerous werth?
definitely
i've already spenr my 60 bucks worth in time
just need friends to play with for more ;P
why is it better than star cit?
it has content available within the next century
basically it's a fully formed game that is just getting better with time
star citizen is taking forever to become a fully formed game
and ships in this aren't pre-order to play
or usd
they're all in-game currency
star citizen master race
and no i didnt buy the chair
star citizen will be great when it's released
but it's really not comparable to E: D
they're different games
both good probably
elite dangerous just happens to already be playable
star citizen's expected release date is only a year away
riiiight
they have hit all their other planned release dates so far havent they? within a few months of their target
true
well if thats the case then i'm excited
I'm not a fanboy either way, but E: D is definitely a good game
god the mindcrack people are only at the doll house in Until Dawn
soooo slow
lol
wow
one episode per week at 15min per episode
woo
just installed the arena match module that E: D is pushing out
faster paced than the real game
like halo with starships
kinda
they had a better analogy that I can't remember
so
RL while you DL E: D?
but
its not dark yet
you cant soma
find me a youtube video that can persuade me to buy it
hmm k
gimme a minute
gotta pick the right one
there are a lot with too much technical content
why the fax is soma downloading
i pre-loaded it
update?
it is 10.3 gb
big update?
oh it is unpacking it, but it's the same screen as the download screen
so
this month SuperComfySocks is doing bamboo socks
I am intrigued
no video is really going to do it justice
the scale of the universe, the feeling of actually being in it and part of it is the reason I love it
basically in this video the guy we're seeing is fighting against the largest, most expensive ship available with something worth 1/100 the amount
how much effort is required to get the best ship?
quite a bit
how many hours would you estimate?
hmm
well
lemme check how many I have in the game
to 1500
and can it be expedited by working together?
I'd say about 600 to 1000
and is it significant to have it, or does everyone have one by now?
i'm a tenth the way to an anaconda
i see
and I have 60 hours
so a significant grind
oh yeah
i like grinds
It took me 60 hours to get my current ship, the imperial courier
lemme link a pic
worth about 10m credits with a full loadout like I have
the anaconda is worth 105m
or 150
i forget
the imperial ships are smexy
so for the grind: It took me about 4 hours in the starter ship to upgrade to a viper, worth 100k credits
from there I went to a diamondback scout: worth 400k
that took a good day
from there I got a type 6 trade ship and ground out 10m credits in about 15 hours
and bought my courier
then I stopped because school started
i bought it, but im not gonna be able to play it right away
woo
all the docs should get it so we can be a cool group that goes around slaying people who pick on newbies like in the montus domus days
and also slaying newbies
sure
with funny tactics
that is afterall how the term "WADDAFAK" originated
lol
ITS A TRAP
so
rl for a bit?
ye
i wanna see if i am any better
okay
gimme a sec
Brandon Worl
huh
Elite looks good
Space truckers
hm
it looks good
it's quite a grind
but it is pretty
and fun if you take the slightly longer route to grinding out the money
trading is the kind of thing that makes you tons of money but you really want a netflix screen while you're doing it
thx
but I thought it was criticized for having limited players per server?
limited players per instance probably yeah, but you'll never notice the difference
hmm
Brandon Worl
jeeze he is just not giving up on this solo wing ace
hmm?
the guy he served justice to
i so wanna play that now
like
the tac maneuvers we could do
pirating
mining trade
soma is pretty good so far
welp, thats enough soma for tonight
lol
enough?
guys wanna do a couple threes matches before bed?
also tony: yeah doing combined operations seems like a lot of fun
especially for survivability
got gangraped by three pythons earlier (second best combat ship to the anaconda) and got kaboomed, having other peeps with me would have made it doable if we were all decent at the game
i just need to make sure i'm decent lol
you gun' join us?
I can help you through the decent part
it's ezpz to get the hang of if you have guidance
my guidance was shittons of youtube
hi
hi
sup doge
code reviewwww
oh yay
so far not bad
how's that goin?
nice
two suggestions so far
1. take the long likes, and turn them in to smaller lines
does AL do the code review or does someone in originate do it?
2. change the enum error message
someone at originate
gotcha
woo code review done
now I wait about 40 minutes for it to build on Circle CI, pray to god it doesnt fail, and then merge! :D
noice :D
and then you get to go home for the day right!? :P
nein
so
the innevation center in reno looks cool
Brandon
i work in the vegas innevation center
do you know about shooting tomorrow?
it doesnt have a cool maker space
i might not be able to, ian
Okay
I might end up working from home the second half of the day
I just need to know for planning wise
depending on if they need me to do stuff
which they might
Can you text me tomorrow?
yeah
I might know by later tonight
Oh okay
Thanks
AL assigned some other people to cover a few of my tickets, since I'm gonna be out
but idk how well those other people know this code
where would we be shooting at, btw?
Either the clark county shooting complex
or boulder city
i see
shooting in the desert is more enjoyable imo
It is
But
None of us have desert driving cars
this is true
Boulder city you can rent a range
so it would be just us
The embankments and such are set up into little private booths
at least, thats what their pictures show
unless you can think of a place my car can get to
lol
just use brandon's corolla that cant go in reverse
i'm sure you'll end up in a desert naturally
lol
because who doesn't want to get in a dirty-ass car with no air conditioning after having just spent like an hour out in the hot dusty desert firing guns
exactly
with like an 80% chance of getting stranded
80% is nothing
that's 20% to be just fine
oh so
I've got updated grind time numbers
I made 2 million credits in an hour last night with my courier
so it's only about 75 hours of grind from 0 credits and a courier to get the anaconda
not that you'd want an anaconda anyway
I'm much more excited for the imperial clipper
the federal corvette looks cool
it's not out yet sadly
i know
probably coming out in the next big expansion
but yeah
that's my end goal ship
like
since I started i've wanted it
so I need to get about 300m credits (expected value of a fully kitted one) by the time it comes out
are all ships operated by a crew of 1? or could we all operate different systems on the same ship if we had you, me, and tony?
eventually there will be multi-crew functionality
currently only one per
the turreted weapons are AI run right now
multi-crew would be cool
yeah
that's expected two expansions from now
first expansion is the first part of planetary landing, complete with buggy
comes out christmasish
ideally, with a four man wing (me, you, tony, ian) we'd have two pythons and two federal gunships or imperial clippers
pythons are multipurpose, fdg and icl are assault
I want to play some cqc
is there a list of planned expansions?
but the matchmaking takes forever because everyone is trying out new ships instead
over the course of the next six years they're going to regularly release expansions
six years is a long time
gotta keep going until star citizen is finally released :P
but yeah
they have planned on a really long support window for the game
as it currently stands we have about half the total number of ships (14 more or so are planned)
and about 50% the functionality of the overall game
basically they're just taking their time
and since frontier's main income is from E: D they have no reason not to follow through
their only other project is rollercoaster tycoon
oh thats why it takes so long
they spend all their time tormenting little people in Rollercoaster Tycoon
lol
separate dev teams for each
but that would be a funny explanation
the f63 condor looks awesome
looking at all this elite dangerous stuff makes me want to play star conflict again
the new cqc mode is like a faster paced star conflict
with fewer ships
but cooler physics
I want to play elite dangerous now :(
but I must write atari code
atari code is so weird
the only weird part is syncing with the screen writes
other than that it's fairly straightforward assembly
my game had issues and idk why
what were the issues?
rendering things
i dont remember exactly
like the screen flashed and stuff
or maybe it turned rainbow colored
did you count your clock cycles and match them to the h and v sync cycles?
cause if you didnt
then you'd have issues
i think so
it was like 2 years ago
so idk
lol
man elite dangerous expansions are expensive
yeah
but they're like entirely new games
$60 for landing on planets seems steep
the planetary landing expansion is going to have a buggy, with guns and upgrades, that can drive on rocky/icy planets, mine, explore, and attack outposts
and that's just one of the new features
they're also introducing a new loot system
not sure what it entails yet
still seems excessive
but it's going to be big, we know that much
yeah
an expansion that costs as much as or more than the main game
but think of star citizen and it's ship buying
but you can buy ships with ingame credits cant you?
there was an 80 dollar pack that got you the new expansion and the base game when they first announced the expansion
maybe 90
star citizen? only a few of them
there are a bunch of exclusive ships
there are some, but I think most can be bought in-game
but having a ship that costs $5,000 is stupid
yep
though, if elite dangerous releases a new ship with the final expansion, six years from now with two expansions per year at sixty dollars each, then that ship will cost 60 + 2*60*6 dollars if you buy everything for full price
so $690
er
no
do you get the ships that are included in the expansions just from buying them?
or do you still have to buy them in-game too?
$780
you have to buy them in-game
no freebies
and i assume you dont have to buy all expansions?
I don't think so
well then that ship wouldnt really be $780
well, it would be a maximum of 780
minimum of probably 120
without any discounts
that's closer to a recuring membership for an mmo than paying $1000 for a single item in SC
I bought E: D for like 35 bucks
er
i got it for my birthday for 35 bucks
lol
you can get all DLC for $190
well
I assume all
yeah, people have been comparing it to about five bucks a month mmo style
ye
all the expansions
either 190 or 780
so that's a lot less than $780
lol
yeah
people flipped out when they first announced the plans for expansions because they did the crazy over the top math
but they're really being pretty nice with pricing
it's literally an mmo service
that we're paying no monthly for
i want them to add a first person expansion
it's planned
it feels like only half a world without first person
oh no
it feels like a whole world
believe me
no man
it feels like it is missing an entire experience
the universe is a big place
lol
most of it empty
well, the galaxy is a big place
and it has lots of star systems to visit
but most of the points of interest are localized right?
kinda
inhabited space is still massive
I've only visited like 200 systems, which is a tiny percentage
I've never been to an entire factions side of space
regardless, having first person so you can visit/raid other people's ships/bases/planets would be cool
yeah
it feels like an incomplete space mmo without all that
well we're getting another perspective with raiding when PLandings comes out
the buggy
you should move to europe and join frontier and make the development go faster
or
well
yeah maybe i could see my bands more often
lol
lol
man i was gonna have so much to do today and then they reassigned it all to other people
lol
go home
play Elite with me
imma have to get up sooo early tomorrow :(
whai
gotta go to court at 8
ouchie
I have class at 930
so i'll be up at 8
imma just go to the judge and be like "I ain't did it your highness"
and then all will be better and I will go home
lol
what's the court appearance for anyway?
crashing in to another car
well yeah but isnt that kinda cut and dry?
like
why do you have to have a hearing at all?
idk
to waste tax payer dollars of course!
lol
well
that was actually really easy

whai
thats me
Plank is an evil plotting genius
are you and evil, plotting genius?
no plank is board
and i am bored
go home
whaii
play with meeee
I want a frostee
i want an icee
or a snow cone
they had snow cones out in front of the joe yesterday
damn
graduated too early
missed a good opportunity for a snow cone
but I couldnt get one because it was for some conference and you had to have an orange ticket and the lady wouldnt even sell me one
what a snow cone nazi
right?
so i went home and cried
I would have told her that Jeremiah asked me to go get her, and that he was in the Joe
and when she was gone I would have made myself one
lol
diablo clone + mmo: https://www.deviliangame.com/en/
i want to play diablo
gotta farm them cows
i never got a reply about that chair
hi
ho
the chair is a lie
it was basically a free cake for participation and 100 dollars
boredom
dum de dum dum... dum de dum boredommmmmm
ok so if I get Elite Dangerous
Who will play
Me and brandon for sure
I know Supernova and one or two of those guys wanted to get back into it
Devilian
but I already have Guild Wars 2
erg
must read more Elite Dangerous
actualy Andrew
Do you think the Expansion pack will be werth?
I own it
Elite Dangerous?
Yes
actually
How long have you played it?
what do you think of it?
I've only played I think a couple hours
Its rather grindy
but with a group it could be fun
Its space trucker sim most of the time
not anymore
the new update makes mercing profitable again
ahh
and yes the new update looks worth
So not just moving illegal slaves for hours at a time?
nope, I made 2m in an hour of bounty hunting in a hazardous resource extraction site (theyre new)
Well with a group this sounds as though it could be entertaining
We could be pirates
we could
but yeah, hazardous res sites are much better taken with a group
we'd designate a target for each of us, focus fire the shields down and let the designated person finish the hull
because bounties are last hit collect
this sounds fun. must review more
no review
just buy
and review by play
I will show you a let's play that I watched when starting out, and it should show you the basics of the beginning grind
You also need music
to stave of the bordem
music is nice yeah
nah
of long range travel
no boredom if youre with friends
Fair enough
this guy is one of the best content producers for E: D
he has the best setup for recording anyway
and he's intellegent with how he plays
wakakakakakakaka
hi

i'll watch it while i play gw 2 lol
it's $30 I may jsut drop on it tonight
we'll see
hmm
so like genuine space mmo
grind first
get established
wreck face :D??
pretty much
.....oooooooooh
when die, ship refresh?
insurance on the ship, your pilot ejects and gets picked up by the last station you visited (aka you respawn at the last station you visited, paying 10% the worth of your ship)
gotcha
is keyboard/mouse an issue?
if you don't have the insurance money then you start back with a sidewinder (the starting ship)
lots of people use kb/m
nothing wrong with it, but using a hotas is more immersive
there's a 40 dollar one that most people use
but mouse/kb is just fine
hmmmm
it would be funny to use my voice changer in an angies list meeting
lol
downloading
do helium voice
woo
we should play when tony's done downloading
lol i'll be so slow
y
u r slow
bcuz lurn
jk lulz
nah the learning curve isnt that bad with a buddy
I'm gonna make my way to the starting sector
also
we'll play on my private group server until we get out of noob sectors
because the gank is real
and I can't afford to lose my ship too many times
imma drive over to the noob sectors now
deco
join me
Elite dangerous has stopped wroking
twice
thrice
restarting
during the download?
no
fully dl'd
oh gotcha
yeah the launcher breaks sometimes
er
its from the new stuff they're pushing out
ah
the cqc stress test added some stuff that they werent planning on originally with the launcher so they had to rewrite a bunch
THE MONSTER IS RIGHT AROUND THE CORNERRRRR
OHGOD

Good Morning!
on a scale of 1 to wicked witch of west + water, how melting are you in vegas?
how was court?
i presented a compelling argument and got 0 points 0 traffic school
wow
nice
Oh vegas is very nice and cool right now in my room :D
what was your argument?
last night it was hot though
and muggy
"I'll pay the $100 for 0 points and 0 traffic school"
haha
well that works
reno was nice and cool until about half an hour ago
now it's like 90
Lol Ian told me to skype him when I got up, but I think he's the one still sleeping
unheard of
Is it 12:18?
none of my devices switched times zones xD
oh well
lol
I like my housekeeping lady
she's shy but laughs at my jokes and leaves me extra towels
o/
andrew
hi
had class
sorry
hi
just got home
how classy
AI: todays lecture was entirely on the chain rule for derivatives with multiple variables
I was told I'd never use that shit
lol
so wassap?
you mentioned upcoming changes to mining
yessir
got any more details on that?
hmm
well
do you want a quick explanation or a link to the actual changes?
either
basically, refineries currently have weird issues with not managing multiple mined materials nicely
i've never done it myself so i'm not sure the extent
but that is fixed in the new update
and the refineries are "smarter"
aka they prioritize things for you in some convenient way
I'm looking for a link to better explanation now
doesnt sound like the kind of change that will make mining significantly more profitable
based on a quick reddit search mining seems like 10x worse than everything else
it's not the most profitable but it seems it is more viable after the update by about 3 or 4 times
and refineries are going to automatically insert items from your cargo bay into them if they have an open slot
which was previously not a thing
second main comment by zebarmy seems most helpful
lol I just realized etho's episode 420 title is "graze it"
ohai
hi
Erite Dangerous?
ANYONE?
ANYONE?
no ok

hola :D
holy shit they actually confirmed that large ships are getting carryable small fighters
this new update is insanely big
hi
hi
Hi :)
Tony when are you going to get your chips? :P
Errrrrr good question
going ot LiB today
boo :P
also wondering if pixate does nexus 6 prototyping
ll seems to be some errors
why hello
Hello
hi
Hello
how is paradise?
Paradise is hot right now
so hot.
*all the time
ftfy
lol
I do have to say the heat in vegas is more bearable than the comparative heat in california/reno
the slight increase in humidity makes everything worse
I cant even imagine D:
yeah, thankfully it only gets up to like 100 in these places, not the insane 114ish that vegas reaches
if we hit that we'd have people literally dropping dead
We tried to go shooting today but the gun range was too busy
that's why you have to just drive out to the middle of nowhere
-_-
unity is dumb
upgrade unity client: it removes all of your standard asset objects from the scene
so I now have a game with nothing in it
:F
Hitler did nothing wrong
also Indians are barbaric
we know, Ian
thanks
Too hot
LiB was nonsense at 2pm
super hot
super hot
New phone woo
nice
what kind?
wat phone
also i am home
concert was really good
also i can confirm that cali is hot
and humid
yep
sweet
hi
I've almost made reasonable progress on my game, we should play some E: D soon
or RL
or anything
im up for some E: D
woo
gimme like
possibly til 7
i need some time anyways
am starving
trying to fix input issues
so anyways
my legs are soo stiff/sore
from concert + long car ride
my butt hurts from sitting so long
I need a break
lol
been working on this since 12
or a better chair
or a better butt
pants, I think
my chair is great
my pants are rigid and I think the buttons for the back pockets are what's making it hurt
lol
i tried out that $1400 chair
they had it in a fancy chair store in LA
how was it?
it is cool
not $1400 cool, but if I can get it used for a good price and in good condition I would do it
cool
lemme know when you wanna do games
hopefully soon, I cant get unity to let me use this imported asset's namespace and I can't find relevant results on google :(
just sudo import
k i gave up

o/
mornin' neighbors
mornin
we should visit a nebula
that would be fun
exploring with a group would probably be fun
i need unlimited credits
exploring takes a month, but with a good setup and dedication you can get a good 100m
100m aint bad
yep, it costs about 20m to get that going though
maybe less
but top tier exploration scanners are a couple mil each
i need moar banana wrap
mobanana
notice me senpai
notice mayyyyy
I can be explorers
So down
hi
some of the stuff you find is friggin beautiful to look at
and if you're even a little into astronomy you'll be excited by everything
we should be fuel rats
I think skype bugged, cause it says brandon is typing infinitely
and my messages aren't sending
but my internet is fine
weird
same
fixed
my messages are kinda sending after a delay
server issues it seems
but skype messaging is p2p
completely?
i think so
idk about that one
messages dont send unless there are multiple people online in the group chat room
their message logger is probably the middle man
and it's having issues
Hi NSA
they queue up and only send once someone else logs on and the sender is also on
which seems entirely p2p to me
that could just be an efficiency thing though
doesnt seem any more efficient
and makes it possible for messages to never be seen
which is kinda a downside
keeps the server open for other communication instead of sending or holding messages for someone who wont get it at the moment
but this is text
hey man
its like as light weight as it gets
running on MS's servers
i dont think they need to do that lol
this is formatted text that can be sent alongside video clips and emoji
video clips and emoji transmitted as text
pshh
HUGE
anyways pretty sure it is all p2p
my internet has been having issues loading fb and stuff
jigawatts of data man
jigawatts
and it appears only you and I are in this chat
so it was probably my internet holding it up
you think?
I guess it's possible
i do
well just ruin all my theorys then
rude
yes i just spelled theories "theorys"
r00d
r00d d00d
olde englysh
but yeah i dont see why they would bother having a server for messaging
it'd cost a lot and have little benefit
ye
easier to store/log messages in transit that way though
yeah
idk how/if they do that
oh i'm sure they do
lol
psh
MS is a totally reputable company that respects our privacy
their best buddy's name is Noah Shamik Arslan though
y do nexus phones not have a micro SD card slot :|
both of the new nexus devices reportedly dont haven them
do they really need them?
I mean sure it's nice to have the option
but how much storage do they have natively?
the 6p will have 16, 32, and 128 options i think
or maybe its 36, 64, and 128
the 5x is only 16 and 32 i think
if that's the case then I really don't think they need them
lol
my n5 is 16
it just ends up taking more space in hardware
and I have to constantly delete stuff
shoulda bought a bigger one
well
yeah
lol
but I have a 64gb micro sd card
sitting around doing nothing
and a 64gb micro sd card costs waaaaay less than updating the phone to have 16 more gb of internal space
and it's convenient when switching phones
since you can install apps to sd cards
i just want a phone that has a micro sd card slot and a huge battery
like take the phone
and make it twice as fat
and use all that for battery
but then it wouldnt be ultraslimthinpaperphone
which is unacceptable
real phones have bulk!
I am tired of these impossible standards set by the media!
lol
on reddit last night there was a thing with barbie and the whole argument feminists use saying "unfair standards set for young women" and then there was a picture of he-man
lol
for some reason people keep ordering extremely bad candy at the office
and passing it around for everyone to try
this game actually looks really fun
lol voyager and serenity
and galactica
yeah i thought that was some nice fan service lol
it looks like a game I'd pick up in a humble bundle
yeah
I'm gonna wait and see if it goes on sale
definitely puttin it on my wishlist for notification though
I want to do spess things
spess
i need to work on my armor
deadlines are approaching
deadlines?
yes
halloween
ah
lol
how much do you have to do still?
havent worked on it in over a week
still just have the torso armor
gotta do crotch/butt armor next, then shoulders, then arms, then legs
so you have lots to do
lol
crotch/butt can be done in 1 day, 2 max. shoulders 2 to 3, arms i dunno, probably 3, legs probably 3
that's like half the time til halloween if you work like every day
but there's more work beyond that
thats just to make the pieces
then I gotta set up the straps/stuff
there will be an under suit with velcro or buttons to attach leg/arm pieces
also touch-up work and if I have time, painting
gl;hf :P
"'<{([hello])}>'"
hi
btw ian/courtney tony said he can join us for dinner tomorrow
lucky
someone needs to invent a cheap teleporter so I can come too
Where though
in the middle of a resource extraction site somewhere in the galactic zone owned by the empire
so
what are peeps up to?
just bathed the dog
I don't miss wet dog smell
lol
idk what it is, but that smell gets me the same way new cars do
lol

i didnt know Chris Hadfield is making an album
i just randomly stumbled across it on youtube
osnap
its pretty good
well he is pretty good with a guitar
"ok cya folks"
is one hours later
this is why i can't sleep
lol
why
what time for dinner is preferable for you tony?
Oh that too
there we go
also I am open to restraunt suggestions
7 could work for me
7 is a bit late
If Bootlegger is no good for you guys
wait
i'll get home at
5:30
so
i'd have to sit around for like an hour and a half
6?
(nao carpool?
6 is better for me
well
i'd be leaving from work
since it is like 5 mins from the resturaunt
if it's that early
so i cant carpool
because i will not be near you
unless i work from home tomorrow
we could take suggestions for another italian place?
the place is fine with me
okay
same
I think the place should be changed
Its like 5 blocks from brandon's office
Place?
Got suggestions?
andrew recommends Archies in Reno
no more italian with the name of a mexican restaurant
I suggest the italian place in peppermill
it's fucklicious
like seriously
goddamn good
Peppermill here is ghetto/hoodrats though
I am jumping into the doctors chat
welcome
I want to go to the one where the mafia eat at.
i bought a sabaton flag today
imma hang it next to my eluveitie flag
peppermill here is really nice
next to my signed within temptation poster
next to my signed nightwish poster
and then i will have no wall space
Bootlegger is the old mafia one
lol
but do they give you four different kinds of delicious homemade bread right as your party sits down?
They give you bread and oil
and have been in business since about 1950
Though they are in a new building
They used to be in the ghetto on tropicana
the concert venue i went to was built in the 20's
it was super nice inside
When did you get so into sabaton?
Ian is not comfortable in the ghetto
sabaton was months ago
oh
i misread that
i got so in to sabaton months ago
Courtney: The place is no longer ghetto
It just used to be in the ghetto
Which place?
yeah it isnt ghetto
The Italian place
which Italian place?
yes
The Bootlegger
the place I told you about
like
2 hours ago
lol
apparently Hadfield's voice sounds weird in his music because it was recorded in space
thats a good reason i suppose
Yes
I too clicked on that post
wat
i didnt click on a post
wat
Oh there is a post on reddit
with his song
i didnt see it
lol
and that's one of the comments
lol
didnt see that
You are now in the meta
i found his song by exploring recommended channels on youtube
you are now meta brandon
I'm So Meta Even This Acronym
Your youtube = reddit's youtube
you have become one
i am clearing out my old/lame subscriptions
and adding new cooler subscriptions
like Mr. Hadfield
anyways
tony
Toe

7 is a nice number
6 looks funny
6 is nicer
you are more of a 6 type of person

tony will cook us a homemade italian 3 course meal
Mezzo Bistro and Wine

from my work
lol
So 6?

Google needs to learn how to pronounce gif
or start calling themself Joogle
lol
"GRAPHICS DOES NOT START WITH A J"
wow Mario has really moved up from being a plumber

lol
the new chromecast actually looks pretty good
that show they just demonstrated the chromecast with has a hurdy gurdy in the intro song
lol
that was an awkward ending

the bread was amazing

bred
lol don't compliment Courtney's walking
it will go to her head
lol thank you Tony ^-^
writing atari code is a fucking headache
whats everybody doing?
sitting
wow me too
I am also sitting.
WOO
sitting club!
such sit. many butt. wow
indeed
courtney why dont you play rocket league?
Cause its gay
dont listen to ian's devil worship
it's a fun game
Its not fun
its all the things you don't like
so she doesnt like fun?
That game is anti-fun
YOU HAVE NEVER PLAYED IT SCRUB
GET ON MY LEVEL
lol it looks fun
CAPS LOCK
see
she says it looks fun
we will see
I wish to place a bet
she won't buy
I know her
My plane gets delayed at YYC
that's fine
she says it looks fun
looks
GAY
which means she's interested enough to play if it becomes cheap
GAY backwards is YAG which stands for Yep, Awesome Game
looks backwards is skool
which is funny
wat
he's confused! Get him boys!
guys the nexus 6p looks like such a good phone but it is soooo big
i am torn
big == good
true
wow, python agrees with me
big == hard to use one-handed
true
it's not that hard
you have big hands
big = more likely to be dropped
not even
I drop my big phone wayyyy less
nah small stuff is also dropped a lot
more surface area to grip
i just dont like having a huge phone in my pocket
#littlehandsproblems
don't put it in your pocket then! put it in your briefcase
or backpack
or phanny pack
you seem like that kind of guy
but my pocket is more convenient
well then put it in your pocket
but it is big
if it's not an apple device it won't even bend if you sit on it
it is all metal
but it's good metal
it's like
sabaton metal
lol
lol
hard metal
but it is soooo bigggggg
lookit
it is sooo big
that should say 6p not 6x
damn even the 5x is big
what's the difference between the x and the non x?
5x and 6p are the new devices
then what's the 6x there?
the 5 is 2 years old and the 6 is 1 year old
a typo
lol
gotcha
it looks nice
size compared to note iv/v?
wow
it's bigger
damn
I need a nexus 6p
oh but the screen is smaller
6 vs 6.7
i dont think it is bigger
the 6 is a 5.7 inch screen
the actual dimensions are larger
hmm
then this site is wrong?
note5 is 153.2x76.1x7.6 mm
or the new one is different
6p is 159.3x77.8x7.3
that is bigger
welp
yep
lol
thinner at least
yeah
not surprising
i wonder what the battery life is like comparatively
note5 is a 5.7 inch screen
that site was off then
lol
6p has a larger battery
I need a 6p
6p has a 3450 mAh battery
note5 only has 3000
6p has a better camera too
no optical image stabalization, but larger pixels so it takes better low light pics
and has 240 fps slow-mo
also usb type c
and dual front-facing speakers
and no bloatware
and timely updates
like I said
I need dis
lol
the note5 has 4gb of ram vs 3 for the 6p
but that isnt a huge issue
isnt it?
especially with Marshmallow
where's graham cracker?
or chocolate bar?
lol
android 6 is supposed to get a 30% battery life boost
that's nice
RL minus chat?
nah imma sleep soon
it's only 1135
i'm making french fries
they'll take a bit
so I have to stay up
well
im not making fries
but i am
are you
yes
go take them out of the oven
they are done
they're really not though
I had to put them in extra long because they wouldnt cook
man the music video for Nightwish's Endless Forms Most Beautiful is so strange
lol
fries are don
why are you eating don's fries
nono
i made don into fries
gross
don is yummy
you enjoy having don in your mouth?
nah, my stomach though, that's another story
so you swallow don
yeah
what else would you do?
spit him back out
that seems counterproductive
wat is tat
that looks like an interesting cityscape in kerbal space program
with boats on land
whai
whai
he sounds like a duck
whaii
quack
i had my last 8:15 am Angie's List meeting
:"D
woooo
those tears were a typo but I decided to keep them
also android
I found a joy stick last night
while looking for my parents security dvr password
lol
what kind?
the same one sushi had in his lab
logitech xd or something like that right?
something like that
3d extreme
it is similar
but older
that on top of your keyboard will be nice
if you set a toggle key on your keyboard (or just use two-key input for some controls) you'll have plenty of buttons on that too
i think this is what I have
i dont think the stick rotates
oh
well then
that's less nice
lol
still not bad though
oOoOoOoOoOoOo
i think i just heard a spoopy ghost
oooohhhhh
spoopy
2spoops5me
aAbBcCdDeEfFgGhHiIjJkKlLmMnNoOpPqQrRsStTuUvVwWxXyYzZ
whai
bored
play games with me then
kant
can
't
minus the 't
minus the can
so you 't?
that was already minused
so you ""
yes
:7
o7
o/
\ o /
o//
lol why does that have a link?
idk
i remember the first time i saw an emoji
it was ":)"
except text
and it took me like 3 minutes to finally see a face
lol
kronovi's stream quality is extra potato today
so, it'll be a few days before i get my next project assigned to me
they said i should work on personal development in the mean time
finish your mc mod?
i kinda lost all interest in minecraft when i saw "purpur" blocks
and 1.9 in general
lol
yeah
but modded is way behind that
so it's better
yeah but meh
its time for new things
skyrim mod
nah
hearthstone AI that plays for me?
they suggested I work on Android stuff, or take a coursera course or something
ooh
hearthstone AI that plays for me on android
lol
fun fact
swapping hearthstone and android in that sentence still makes sense
kinda, yeah
lol
I could make an android game that takes advantage of the new chromecast stuff
their new stuff lets you cast the game to the chromecast, and then render something else on the phone/tablet
such as controls or whatever
that's awesome
if it was a card game the table would be on the tv and your hand would be on your phone
no room taken up on the screen for the game
yeah
it's brand new too
and my new chromecast will get here tomorrow
but i think it works with old chromecasts anyways
I just need to think of a good game to make
or maybe i should just make a crap game
to learn the api
and android game development
make something in unity
unity is ezpz
yeah idk how to connect the Cast API with unity
do you know?
probably really easily, unity is just c sharp code linked to android
That image was cities skylines
lol
oh nice
My city
the water looked awful kerbaly
Unity
engine
Separation
train
idk
TRAINS>!>>!>!>!>!>!>!
lol
choochoo
making a tribes 2 construction mod inspired Unreal game would be cool
it would also be really hard
seems easy to me
with all the stuff you could do in that?
just let the player place/rotate beams
that is the core of con mod
then add texturing
then add special stuff like switches and teleporters
but at the core it is just placing/scaling/rotating/texturing static beams
sounds SUPER easy :P
yeah
i am done with angies list
it is official
 \ o /  o//
WOO
weeheee
noice
ja
do you happen to have your old atari code?
dunno
probably not
figuring out how to draw two players is fucking difficult
yeah it took me forever
and my solution was buggy
Im home. Alive :P
Congrats
damn!
I mean
good news!@
I knew that turbulence was fishy...
O/
o7
Was that the slogan for the sharknado movies?
never watched them
Also o/
never watched em either
hi
i am trying to learn about 3d modeling for 3d printing
It would make for a great pun tho
that is my masterpiece
it holds 96 batteries
lol
whai?
my brother needs a box that holds AA/AAA
Whai not?
also why is it curved?
because the AAA don’t stick out above the top of the box very much at the edges
so if you put the AAA near the middle it is a bit more convenient
aha
gotcha
well
looks cool
I don't have that many batteries though so it'd be rather useless for me lol
lol
i have no clue if that lid will actually fit
but this design has a problem anyways
The holes are narrower at the bottom, to hold AAA steady
but if it is flipped upside down while the lid is on, they will fall out of the narrower part
so they will stay in their spots, but they will rattle
What if there was a small lever at the bottom of each hole that activated a hook to keep them in? No rattle and you wouldn't need the lid
i don’t have the 3d modeling skillz
lol
Plus moving parts means it can break and you could get people to buy more of them
if the holes were lined with squishy foam it could work
That is true
you can’t 3d print squishy foam though
I’m trying to learn 3d printing not arts and crafts!
Have you heard anything about 3d printing metal?
a bit
I thought I heard something about it being a thing recently
its expensive and you can’t print as large of an area
via Shapeways, at least
MIT can print glass
Shapeways can too
but only a small volume
I wonder if it would be possible to print circuit boards, or do you think they are too small/complex to do?
At least right now
I’m pretty sure i have read about a few circuit board printers
or saw a video on reddit or something
In that case downloading more ram could actually be a thing in the near future xD
u wut
wat
my battery box will cost >300 dollars to print
dafuq
whai?
lots of material?
i feel like the site you're looking at either way overcharges or you're going for a larger object than I thought
its like 11x2 inches
out of plastic
I can print it for $140.90 via MakeXYZ instead of shapeways
but that is still about $130 too much
i can print it with stainless steel
for a mere $2k
I can print it in 10k yellow gold for $232,703.44
so cheap
wow
a steal
so wassup peeps
nmu
just played some rocket league
did pretty well
im trying to reduce the volume of my model to save money
there's no way you can't find another place to get it from for cheaper
you could buy your own 3d printer for that much
i found a place to print it for $140
still could buy a printer, and an arduino, put it together, code it yourself, and get a better print than what they'll give you
for cheaper
idk
fillament costs money too
not that much
they're upcharging like 100 dollars for the 140 dollar one
that's ridiculous
should be around 40
at the most
it's not like you're buying their printer for them
it is almost exactly 400 cm^3
the model
so 10 cents per cm^3
surface area of .499 cm^2
should be about right
well, I have access to a 3d printer
some quick googling says it's usually $0.03 to $0.05 per cubic cm
a 22 dollar roll of high grade filament, 1.75mm type, can make up to 800cm^3 in volume
yeah
I can still probably reduce the volume of this model significantly
so it's about 10-30 dollars for your filament alone
by making the inside hollow or honeycomb'd
they're charging over 100 dollars
honeycomb would be best probably
yeah i just have no clue how to do that
lol
you using blender?
yeah
I know how to do it in solidworks
lol
you could probably make a separate honeycomb pattern model, then resize it and combine a few of them, then stick a cover layer on them
just think cross hatching, in 3d
idk
lol
I have monday - wednesday off next week :D
nice
get your new project after that?
idk
lol
they dont know exactly when i'll get a new project
gotcha
decide on what your personal dev project will be?
no
you're just on top of things arent you
lol
i cant decide
too many possibilities too little motivation
too much lazy
lol
so i figured out my story for my atari game
basically this
idunno
i really wanna get an enhance going on his eyes to see if he's reading a script
wanna play sumthin?
i ran the solidify filter and now it is down to $10 to print
wut
im guessing the walls are paper thin
ah
just thicken them up a little bit
going any thicker messes up the model
I really wish i had a copy of solidworks, it made doing stuff like that really easy
I can do it, but I'll have to remake the model with wall thickness in mind
yeah
that's probably how you're gonna have to do it in the first place though
otherwise it's going to be stupidly expensive apparently
gaemgamgemgame
imma eat my bacon chicken burger
then gamegamesgameasmrasgnamsfg
I had a bacon chicken asiago sandwich from wendys
well, part of one
it was alex's
yeah looks like online services charge $0.25 - $0.50 or more per cubic cm
that adds up quickly
yup
that's like a 20-40 cent markup
40c is a big number
40c is only like two minutes in supercruise with no gravitational influence
i wanna see the martian
is it out?
midnight
ish
tonight?
playing at 9pm at one theater here
yeah
might go do that with alex
she's off at 1015
i missed so much
release dats is oct 2
date*
hello tony
how are you tony
hi
solidify why
can I interest you in a 3d printed battery holder?
maybe
only $380
WHAT A STEAL
you'd better buy now!
lolwhy
because markup on online print services
and because he made it solid
and because it is a giant hunk of material instead of hollow
idk how thick walls should be for it
0.7mm is the min, but that seems really thin
that's tiny
i'd say a quarter inch would be reasonable
i think even 1/8 would be good
just think of a phone case and it's thickness
yeah
between 1/8 and 1/4
depending on budget I guess
the battery holes will help reinforce it
they'll basically act like columns helping to reinforce the top/bottom faces
i could make the side walls just thick enough to where they connect to the holes
yeah, and then have the rest of the internals hollow
that'd work
how deep do the holes go
down to the bottom face
well
not quite
i think there was 1/4 inch of space
don't you only need them to go like 3/5 of the length of a battery?
yeah
thats all they do
gotcha
hard to tell from the pic of your model
theres 2 batterys in the back of the pic
that lid seems extra big
it has like a quarter inch of clearance over the top of the batteries
the perspective of the camera when you took that screen really messes with things lol
the top looks massive in that screen
lol
its about as small as I can make it
just message aiden and get him to put his four cents in mechanical design
nah
lol
lol
if I really want to save money I could do min thickness and split it in to more parts
then assemble it and fill in the voids with expanding foam
filling in the voids with expanding foam would be a good idea
you could make it really thin
like do the 1/8 inch walls and stuff and just lgtmshipit and fill it yourself
i think 1/8 would be strong enough to not need foam
1/10
if it breaks just reinforce it with duct tape
1/10 design, needs foam. OP sucks
subreddit simulator
god subredditsimulator is the best
well if you're gonna go through the trouble of making it and getting it printed, you'd probably rather not have it need duct tape
lol'
idk how strong this material is
stronger than ABS plastic I believe
could look up the filament they're using
more dense, at least
lots of places compare to ABS, idk about being more durable/dense
nahm good
I'll leave a hole in the design's base
why a battery holder
because the material is apparently not water-tight
you could just leave the bottom exposed
and hollow
that would look ugly though
not that you'd be able to see it
you wouldn't be able to if it sits flat on a desk
tony: my brother wants one
RLRLRLRL?
RL?
RL?
E: D?
RL?
ye
My brother presumably wants it for in his truck/at places like burning man
that's a good reason
so it would probably get moved around
gotcha
well then i'd leave a hole
yeah
but fill it with foam or something
we'll see what happens
lol
i'll make a new design tomorrow
i'm now unimpressed with the witcher 3
whaii
it has spiderlike monsters in it
and fire is ineffective against them
the only proper response to spiderlike monsters is lots and lots of fire
unless you are at a gas station
then the proper response is to just abandon your car at the pump
then you create an explosion so that they never come back again
no that makes the authorities mad
you know
they'd understand
there were spiders
i should embed a magnet in the battery holder
to hold the lid in place
that would be cool
and it would allow for a significantly smaller lid
would it?
yeah
how
right now the lid goes all the way down to the bottom of the holder
so that it has a surface to rest on
otherwise if it just rested on top of the batteries directly, it would be unstable
since aa and aaa stick out different amounts
OHHH
with a magnet it could just slide down like an inch and then be held in place
now i get why it was so big
lol
same style lid as the Cards Against Humanity lid
yeah, got that now
was thinking something else
but yeah
with magnets that'd be easier
and save even more volume
Brandon Worl
need more assembly though
Brandon Worl
mornin'
mornin
whassap
just got to work
eww
imma make battery holder v3
lol
v3ii huh
apparently the home button on mac doesn’t bring you to the front of the line
who knew
sounds to me like mac's are inferior
yeah i haven’t decided yet if i want to keep it
on the one hand, stuff tends to work
lol
on the other hand, I don’t know how to do even basic stuff like jump to the beginning of the line
i had to google how to take a screenshot
lol things we take for granted
holy crap
i went to the fridge just now and found a 6 inch sandwich
and it’s mine
I forgot I had that in there
lol
gg
how old is it?
from wednesday
oh not bad
yeah
too bad we’re having SkinnyFats for lunch today
skinnyfats huh
what's that?
its good
they have good food
i have the model down to $262 via shapeways
so printing it yourself would be around $25 worth of materials
that's ridiculous
ruhdicculus
literally 1000% overpriced
lol
you still at work?
yeah gonna leave soon
I’m not sure if i want to use unity or unreal
for what?
building game
gotcha
well I know enough about unity now to help if you needed it
lol
unreal looks so pretty though
it doesn’t seem that bad
uses C++ though
c++ is inferior to c#, I can confirm that
well, c#/javascript
c# is more convenient to use
yeah
that's what I mean
performance wise i'm sure c++ is better, it's a bit lower level
yeah
js is trash though
well that's why everyone uses c# in unity lol
lol
there are one or two things that are easier to do in js
as a language js is just so bad
we were discussing this yesterday in fact
you can assign to index undefined in an array
you can't combine js and c# in the same file, so keeping a hybrid project organized is a pain in the ass unless you do it plugin style
like array[undefined] = 1
wut
also array[if] = 1
works
how t fuc
js is full of terrible stuff like that
lol
see, i left out the "he" and "k" because i had no idea what the hek was going on there
lol
Rust has a game engine called Piston
but
it is still under development and i don’t really want to deal with trying to get everything to work
I just want to work on game features, not making the engine function
lol yeah
anywho
something more defined is nice to use
imma drive home
kk
stupid mac
k
whai
it replaces “imma” with “umma"
lol
it shouldnt replace things in the first place
this is a computer
and i have to ctrl a to go back to the start of a line, instead of home
not a phone
o.o
fuck that shiz
lol
you meant home/end
not insert
but i get it
yes thats what i said!
you're just confused because you're a mac user now
mac and cheese makes my stomach upset
must be a sign
mine too
I had some for lunch
ooh
I also had popcorn
thanks for reminding me
maybe that was the cause
lunch = smash
grab your sammich
which i have to take home
smash?
dafuq
lol
mac stop changing my words
#justmactrashthings
lol
ok bye
come play RL
I want to lose
ugh
rl
lol
if you want to lose we can do that
it's not you btw, i had the same issue with hippos today
it must be me
did he end the game with 10 points?
because I did
40-60 on average
lol
with one or two in the 2-300's
well
maybe I’ll have a good day again
we can hope
safe travels neighbor
thanks neighbor
howdy neighbor

almost have the shoulders done on my armor
awesome
so
whats the happie haps?
yo yo yo
yoyoyo
shoulders just need straps now
but i need loops of some sort so I can thread the shoulders though
just use a drill
and make a hole
doesnt sound very strong
it's foam
its the strongest
just think of how much air is in that foam
air is super strong
wat
Matt Damon
Matt Damon Matt Damon
Nomad Ttam
indeed
so i beat soma
good?
it was alright
there arent multiple endings which is kinda sad
that is kinda lame
the story was good though
scary?
some parts were
it was less immersive than Amnesia
that's lame
immersion is #1 important
it looked nice, the setting was just less relatable
and there were too many enemies
I didnt feel like I was being hunted, I felt like I was just running through a giant facility and occassionally crossing paths with people
interesting
the monsters in Amnesia felt personal, these guys never stuck around long enough to create any kind of connection with the player
It was still fun, but didn't come close to Amnesia status
if they release map maker/modding tools for SOMA, it could be cool
that would be cool
it did run great though
huge improvement over their old engine
yeah amfp was horrible
yup
there were almost no swingy doors
they were mostly button controlled doors
well that's the problem
sup
Planetary
?
I hear you n00bs got wrecked by AI
we got a moon sent at us
but then we did the same thing right after
lol
olo

you see we have to remove lol as the most common word
lol
what
i should make an updated wordcloud
^
do it
working on it
i just got 8 messages returned, but not all of them are from our chat
lol
gotta get our chat ID so I can filter it
thats almost missing like 2 years of messages I think
unless I merged my laptop db
in which case it isnt missing many
77338 messages from our chat
thats all
oldest message of mine is Sun, 18 May  03:26:25 GMT
just over a year
yeah I have the db file from my laptop
lemme query that too
idk where i put it
3 from my laptop's db file
oldest timestamp is Thu, 11 Sep  20:23:15 GMT
which is less old
lol
lol
have you been using the same copy of skype for longer?
nope
I only go to november last year
darn
I copied all the messages
I remember last time I had to filter out a bunch of stuff though
it is so big my text editor froze
sup
sup
1 v 1 me bro
planteretyyua annihidiallaltion
okay, get Rocket League
rocket league sucks
balls
nop
litterally
so
only 50k messages got pasted in to sublime
idk why
lol
this is too laggy
is it
three laggy
no it is too laggy
the cloud is partially generated
it is having a tough time processing the message list
but I see part of the lenny face
yes
YES
YESSSSS
the page is derp because it updates about once every minute now
lol that lenny face
in pieces
